       "\" The Matador stars Pierce Brosnan as a burned out assassin. He's James Bond gone to seed in too-tight garish clothes gold chains and an ugly haircut. Our struggling assassin Julian Noble is in Mexico trying to regain his nerve. Staying at the same hotel is a likable down-on-his luck businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) also trying to regain his equilibrium. Danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques which he demonstrates at a bullfight. Noble is eventually targeted by his employers and shows up in Denver. Writer and director Richard Shepard did the Q&A after this delightful movie at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also down on his luck. After suffering the loss of his agent and rejection of recent scripts he decided to write a story no one would buy and create a character no one would want to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan regains his equilibrium in this movie. (There is life after Bond!) He has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy. Don't miss it. Stay for the closing credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to more of Richard Shepard's projects. \""
