" It was clear right from the beginning that 9/11 would inspire about as many films as World War II and Vietnam combined; however there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good (or rather: bad) as Pearl Harbor. It is a great luck that the first international release about 9/11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world. I'm not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great (Youssef Chahine's for example has a needless prologue with too many cuts and Shohei Imamura's has a really bizarre ending) or that the segments are in the right order (Imamura's being the only one not referring directly to the Twin Towers should open the film not end it Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu's should be the last one instead as it's the most impressive one). But it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers. Consider Samira Makhmalbaf's opening segment in which an Afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in New York and unsuccessfully suggests a one-minute silence. Or Idrissa Ouedraogo's part (which features a bin Laden-double so much resembling the real one that you'll be shocked when you see him I promise) in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on Laden. There's a surprisingly good (and extremely angry) segment by Ken Loach about a man from Chile talking about what he calls our Tuesday September 11 - that September 11 in 1973 when their elected president Allende was killed and Pinochet installed his dictatorship - with the generous help from Henry Kissinger and the CIA. This could have become a terrible effort in Anti-Americanism but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with Inarritu's (mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the WTC and finally a collapsing tower ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing) and Amos Gitai's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in Tel Aviv (hard to recognize but this one is a masterpiece of choreography). All these different segments (I haven't mentioned yet Claude Lelouch's about a deaf girl Danis Tanovic's about a demonstration of the Women of Srebrenica Mira Nair's - strange but it takes an Indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to Western tastes - about a Muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9/11 and Sean Penn's with Ernest Borgnine (yes Ernest Borgnine) as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine) add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget. I am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now. I hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies. But alas it's far more probable it will be remembered as a one-film-only effort. And as the one of the few 9/11 movies made by then that don't reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience. ",positive
" The most hillarious and funny Brooks movie I ever seen. I can watch and re-watch the tape 100 times. I laugh my a** off and I cry on some moments. It is really good and funny movie and if you like Brooks - this is a must! In short - Brooks (billionare) gets to the streets as homeless for 30 days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor. The reality bites but in the end - it is about warm relations between humans... Hightly recommend! ",positive

" The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters. I was quite surprised at how this played out. As a rule sequels are never as good as the original with a few exceptions. Though this one was not a great movie the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact. Jon Bon Jovi was a drawback initially but he proved to be a half-way decent Slayer. I doubt anyone could top James Wood's performance in the first one though... unless you bring in Buffy! All in all this was a decent watch & I would watch it again. I was left with two questions though... what happened to Jack Crow & how did Derek Bliss come to be a slayer? Guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination. ",positive
" The Matador stars Pierce Brosnan as a burned out assassin. He's James Bond gone to seed in too-tight garish clothes gold chains and an ugly haircut. Our struggling assassin Julian Noble is in Mexico trying to regain his nerve. Staying at the same hotel is a likable down-on-his luck businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) also trying to regain his equilibrium. Danny is desperate to close a deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques which he demonstrates at a bullfight. Noble is eventually targeted by his employers and shows up in Denver. Writer and director Richard Shepard did the Q&A after this delightful movie at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also down on his luck. After suffering the loss of his agent and rejection of recent scripts he decided to write a story no one would buy and create a character no one would want to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan regains his equilibrium in this movie. (There is life after Bond!) He has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy. Don't miss it. Stay for the closing credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to more of Richard Shepard's projects. ",positive
" Dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography Extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film with what dialogue there is in German and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway with the film succeeding on a cinematic level not a narrative one. Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey I think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy productive creature; and woman is the creator destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. And oh yeah Hedy does get her kit off. ",positive
" The anime that got me hooked on anime... Set in the year 2010 (hey that's not too far away now!) the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. Seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional New Port City form the Tank Police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks! Oh the insanity! The heroes of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki a red haired Japanese woman (yeah I know they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance) who has just been drafted into the Tank Police and is quickly partnered with blond blue eyed nice guy Al. Leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain (also known as Brenten ) a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses a big revolver and a bad temper. Britain didn't like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special (a giant green monster tank) doesn't exactly endear her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames Bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it. There's also Specs the bifocal genius Bible quoting/God fearing Chaplain purple MO-hawked Mohican and the pot bellied Chief who's right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the Tank Police antics. Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them they're not very well liked by the people. The villains are a cyborg named Buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as Green Peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna & Uni Puma. In the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked Buaku. The story however was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic ( Manga ) book that's very hard to find. All sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred. This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it you'd better go get Quentin Tarantino. Uneven in places but still a lot of fun. Followed by New Dominion: Tank Police .

" I watched this film sort of by accident having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favourites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I've never seen anything like before. Heston casually getting into bed with the furniture while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. Ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this. And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever or what? Luckily I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. Then I watched it again and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. A very nice script - and some great sets too. Just when you thought you'd seen everything . . .

" Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene Pernell Whitaker Michael Landon Dan Blocker and even Guy Williams (as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series). The cast had chemistry and they seemed to genuinely like each other. That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have. It also made many of their best stories into great western drama. Like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season there are bound to be some weak ones. However most of the time each episode had an interesting story some kind of conflict and a resolution that usually did not include violence. While Bonanza was a western the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction. While I am a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; those shows usually ended with a gunfight. Gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict and Bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing. In the early years of Bonanza there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights. Those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series but they are pretty good in and of themselves. In 1964 when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show Guy Williams was brought in to replace him. Williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately Whitaker decided to stay one more year and thus Williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams had stayed on for the duration of Bonanza one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 when Pernell Whitaker left the show. Undoubtedly once Pernell Whitaker left the series the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks. Whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play the nice kid and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family that did not leave too much room for any gunfights. At some point they hired a ranch hand called Candy (David Canary) who became their fourth member of the cast but Candy was never featured in any gunfights and he was hardly more than an older version of Little Joe. For a year or two they also had Ben take in some other lost cousin (Jamie played by the forgettable Mitch Vogel) who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone. Apparently by adding the teenager the studio was looking to attract younger viewers. It also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems alcohol delinquency etc. Those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter-culture movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order TV though Hawaii 5-0 The F.B.I. and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing TV shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief mayhem and crime. The addition of a teenager to the cast gave the Cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general. After Dan Blocker died the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled. The last season was pretty bad as it featured Little Joe tracking down the killers of his wife and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because Little Joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife and how unfair it was that she was killed. I don't think I have ever seen the last episode of the series and I wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way. By the last year there was only Ben (Lorne Greene) actually living on the Ponderosa as Adam had moved away (and never came back even once as a guest) and Hoss had died and Little Joe had left after his wife (in the series) had been killed by drifters. Overall the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series. Once Adam left it slowly declined. Most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too. By 1970 the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical and it had lost a lot of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made and of the 465 episodes that were produced at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama! That is a pretty good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows. ",positive
" A famous orchestra conductor Daniel Dareus suffers what appears a heart attack as he finished conducting a concert. Suddenly we watch him as he arrives in the small town that he has left years before. Since he left so young and having his name changed contributes to give him a new persona. He has bought the old school building where he plans to stay. The building needs a lot of work. One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left behind to be installed in his new abode but no Daniel puts up with the harsh winter in his own way. The local pastor Stig whose church has a small choir comes calling to see if he can interest Daniel in helping but the conductor has no desire to go back to music. Daniel begins to explore his new universe. The town's people leave him alone. He makes an impression on Lena who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supplies. Little by little he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir. Lena will ultimately fall in love with Daniel. At first the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected. As they get to know him better they come around to accept him and make him one of them. His new position doesn't endear him to the woman who used to be in charge. The members of the choir are a motley crew but they realize the change Daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs. The new piece composed for Gabriella a battered wife makes a great impact in her life and that of her fellow singers. Daniel's ideas for the repertoire clash with Stig's own. The vicar suddenly begins seeing Daniel in a new light; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love to his wife Siv. His ideas clash with the dogma as Siv points to him. Stig decides to try to put a stop to what he considers an unhealthy influence of Daniel by firing him as the head of the choir. The choir which has been invited to participate in a competition travels to Austria. Daniel who by now has fallen totally for Lena has a chance to show for the first time in his life his feelings for her when she starts to gets doubts about their relationship. Daniel who is late for his own concert gets to hear them making extraordinary music even though he is not in among them. Kay Pollak the director of this enormously appealing film shows he was the man to direct it. The story involves the viewer from the start. Great part of the success of the movie goes to the ensemble cast that was put together. William Nykvist who plays the leading role is the best excuse for watching the film. Frida Hallgren Niklas Falk Ylva Loof do excellent work for Mr. Pollak. Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music one hears. Harald Gunnar Paalgard's cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty. ",positive
" Talk about a blast opening Trampa Infernal has the coolest opening credits ever! Guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary Friday the 13th theme (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha) the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables. Promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasher/backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes. Two extremely competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar. According to a newspaper article there's a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it. The challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls. Upon arrival however it quickly becomes obvious they're not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve. After a whole decade of tame and derivative American slashers this early 90's Mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid. The formula is simplistic but efficient the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful. The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face. The murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric which I was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood. The forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular. Trampa Internal is a Mexican slasher/survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre. ",positive
" Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions so I turned to my twin sister and said Hey this looks like fun - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man but then it was explained that due to his condition he never went through puberty thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... I cried watched some more laughed got up to get another Kleenex then cried some more. Once Jonni Kennedy's time was up he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy you have no heart. ",positive
" Okay that was a pretty damn good episode. Much better than the credit it receives. The camera work is splendid. Best yet. I love that final shot. The atmosphere is fantastic the costumes are great and the guest cast (minus the helpless victims) is strong. What I don't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained. why does it change sex? what's the purpose? and they're aliens? what kind? why were they never shown again in the later mythology? I'm giving this episode a high THREE stars. One of my favorites yet but the plot holes bother me. Still... not gonna let it ruin my entertainment. ",positive
" The first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series! Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! I love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters! Explaining just enough to stay excited! Of course this show has some flaws! In the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season! Many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they will return in later episodes! But it is a little inconsistent! That being said Lost manages to be thrilling every episode(especially the first two seasons)! That is a very hard thing to do! I do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show! This is not a bad thing! It even saves some episodes from getting boring! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But eventually I will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure! The danger of Lost getting canceled due to declining ratings is near! And that would be devastating! ",positive
" I got this film about a month ago and I am now a fanatic fan of Drew Barrymore's. I love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant one with the truths of Red Sox slotted in! It's about a maths teacher who takes some promising kids on a maths trip to a company where the successful Lindsey(Drew) shows them some information. This then leads in the Ben(teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it isn't all simple when he confesses he is a massive Red Sox fan. First of all things are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of Lindseys life. It's all fine in the end and It took one shot to get Drew running across the field!! I got it for two quid in Blockbusters so I was happy. If you like films like this I suggest you see some more of Drew's work like Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with Hugh Grant in called Music and Lyrics. ",positive
" In Rosenstrasse Margarethe von Trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage. The film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter and the story of German women who staged a protest on Rosenstrasse to free their Jewish husbands from certain extermination. In addition to the dramatization of historical events the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the Holocaust by a German and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother. While Ms. von Trotta shows that the courage of a small number of Germans made a difference she does not use it to excuse German society. Indeed she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination the wealthy artists and intellectuals of German high society went on about their lives and parties oblivious to the suffering. Rosenstrasse opens in New York as a Jewish widow Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) decides to sit Shiva a seven-day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which Jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased. When her daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fiancé Luis (Fedja van Huet) a non-Jew Hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an Orthodox tradition that she previously rejected. When Ruth coldly rejects her cousin Hannah questions her and learns about a woman named Lena who took Ruth in as a child when the latter's mother was deported and murdered by the Nazis and she vows to find Lena and discover the secret of her mother's past. Her quest takes her to Berlin where she finds Lena (Doris Schade) now ninety years old and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the Holocaust. With unfailing memory Lena tells her story of how as a young 33-year old woman (Katja Reimann) she searched for her husband Jewish pianist Fabian Israel Fischer (Martin Feifel) who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given Jews in mixed marriages. Lena in a radiant performance by Reimann discovers that her husband and other Jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the Rosenstrasse. Standing together in the freezing night German women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting Give us back our husbands . Lena finds Ruth (Svea Lohde) a young girl whose mother is in the building. She takes care of her protecting her from the Gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed. Lena comes from an aristocratic German family and her brother recently returned from Stalingrad is a Wehrmacht officer. After being refused help from her father to free Fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow Officer I know what they do to the Jews. I saw it . Given his support she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the Minister of Culture Joseph Goebbels a known womanizer. While this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters it is a historical fact that Goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting Rosenstrasse. The director Margarethe von Trotta an activist feminist and intellectual is no stranger to political drama. She directed a film about Socialist Rosa Luxembourg and Marianne and Julianne a story of the relationship between two sisters one of whom resorts to political violence to accomplish her liberal objectives. In Rosenstrasse a film she worked on for eight years she had to make compromises adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced. That it works so well is a tribute to Ms. von Trotta's artistry and the beautiful screenplay by Pamela Katz whose father was a refugee from Leipzig. The events at Rosenstrasse give the lie to Germans who say there was nothing we could do . Now von Trotta has shown the opposite to be true that something could be done to resist the Nazis. It is tragic that the example did not catch on. ",positive
" I don't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless. What about just being entertained? Something at which Morgan Freeman excels. He gets a chance to show off a bit. Paz Vega his co-star gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie. I thought it was a good movie. Some humor some pathos some bittersweetness but nothing over the top. I got an especial kick out of Jim Parsons as the receptionist at a construction company. When he looks at Freeman adoringly and says You make me want to be a woman. He's just hilarious. The fight scene between Ms. Vega her ex-husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too. In short it's a cute charming film that will make you smile. You could do much much worse. ",positive
" Most of the comments have been positive but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets. The set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings stairs doors furniture and so forth. It is worth paying attention to. The movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich. All the gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat. The dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and I suppose it was meant to be that way. This is a film buff's film. It was made by people for people who love the medium. Don't miss this one.

" What a good movie! At last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. Well-known Rockers are getting old and forgotten not the music. And with a good sense of humour. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? Anyway Still Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll I have ever seen. Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance. Why? Because in Still Crazy people are mature. They have a different point of view about rock about love and about life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much. Beyond the story itself we see characters with their own personality weaknesses and dreams. Like anyone of us. Spend a good time watching this (listen to the awesome soundtrack! )and finally thinking of your own future. Bye! ",positive
" May and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is awkward because the grandchildren and kids don't really seem to know each other as one might expect. The warmth that should be there is missing. After dinner May's husband says he doesn't feel well blames it on his daughter's cooking and irritably says he wants to go home. He dies that night. May now a widow is lost. She clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one but she had a purpose. She had someone who needed her and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years she had something to do with her days. She is depressed and unmotivated. She goes to stay with her daughter Paula who shortly after her mother's arrival lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all. She lets loose with anger over her mother's lack of nurturing. May seems disarmed and surprised yet she also doesn't seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right. I'm your mother and I love you. What does really say? (I've heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means.) Paula is a bit (well more than a bit) neurotic. Both women are needy though they show it very differently. Paula has been involved with a friend of her son's Darren who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son. While Paula is working during the day May begins to have conversations and lunches with Darren. Darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son Nicky but supposedly doesn't live in the home with his wife. May becomes attracted to Darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have. Darren becomes attracted to May because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life. (He also becomes too interested in money that May says she can give him to get away from it all though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey. They end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day and May enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years nor had ever expected to know again. As her daughter Paula had often told her that she would leave the married Darren this becomes part of May's rationalization that what she is doing is okay. At a writing group that Paula leads May is introduced rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted. There is one scene where she has sex with the older man who clearly can barely perform and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on May's face as she endures the one-time ghastly liaison. Eventually Paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother that indeed her mother and Darren have been having sex. This film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways. Sympathies will be divided. At one point during Paula's writing group May reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day and would leave for pubs after they were asleep making sure to get back home before her husband. Clearly a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub. May however also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn't like her having any friends so she didn't have any. She did what he wanted her to do. She was miserable but she put up with it because as she said it was easier. So while May was not the best mother for those inclined to have any sympathy for her one might see May's actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for a few minutes in her lifetime. A woman who just wanted someone to listen to her to know her as a human being to have a friend and a lover. Paula though neurotic and unhappy perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her. Certainly it is not difficult to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother. It is a well-done film with more complexities than I have mentioned and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many perhaps conflicting reactions. It is a film worth discussing and debating and above all worth seeing. One thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life. No matter who is deemed right or who is deemed 'wrong by each viewer that theme of old age and loneliness evoking a sense of dread in most of us is inescapable. ",positive
" For Columbo fans such as myself this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why Columbo was so popular and just how good it really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (as ever) playing the wittily intelligent crime novelist Abigail Mitchell. Seems Abigail calls her nephew-in-law to sign some papers making him her heir. She never got over her niece's death and is convinced her dead niece's husband (Charles Frank) did the dirty deed. To tell more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a sly role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbo is in a class by itself. It's a truly well made television movie. I recommend it most highly. ",positive
" This movie is incredible. If you have the chance watch it. Although a warning you'll cry your eyes out. I do every time I see it and I own it and have watched it many times. The performances are outstanding. It deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope. This movie made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience according to my English teacher. Also if you've seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light. Home room is a phenomenal movie and I rate it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heart-wrenching dialogue. Very tense very moving. Doesn't give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind ",positive
" This is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions. It contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy. You get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs. And it ends very upbeat ",positive
" This is one of the best ensemble comedy/musical B film's that I have seen (and since I'm in my 40's now and only seeing this now I am not an expert but I have seen all the well known films out there). When there are a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time usually the comedy interferes with the musical bits and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comedic flow. Call me in a crazy kind of mood but when I saw this on TCM Europe I was laughing out loud with pleasure! So who delivered the laughs for me? Without a doubt Mischa Auer delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs he even steals the ending it was great! Speaking of which I think why this movie works is because although L & H are a selling point (and why I got hooked to watch this one (them and Hal Roach) I love them in their early Hal Roach stuff) this keeps them at a minimum and stays squarely on ADULT fare (by 1930's standards and not that far from today's standards if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch I admit that I only know him from W O OZ and I loved him there and I also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only ugly femme in the 30's movies that actually turns me on (something tells me she was a spitfire in real life); and the musical numbers have a real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish) quality that blew me away from what I am used to in this genre. I could go on and on but rest assured I really enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 I saw it on TCM Europe and will record it to watch again with my wife on TCM USA. Good Stuff! ",positive
" 'The Last Wave' is far more than the sum of its parts. It's not merely a disaster film not simply an exploration into Australian Aboriginal spirituality and certainly more than a simple court drama. Writer/Director Peter Weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' two years earlier that you will continue to remember years later. When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) over the death of an Aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from Lee but making sense of what he hears when it does come. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the Dreamtime the truth exists on two completely different levels with ramifications more disastrous than Burton could ever have imagined. No doubt the reason why 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery. We are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves. In 'The Last Wave' we can piece everything together by the end of the film. However even with all the information we have to choose how much of it we want to believe because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realities. On the production side Weir uses his budget to great effect progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting to heavy rain to good use of sound. The incidental music is unobtrusive never trying to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery. David Gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds wanting to do the right thing but afraid because he already knows the ending. Put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on. Strongly recommended. ",positive
" My wife Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because I am old and grey and still interested in life:-). If anyone has the full lyrics please send them. Of course one big reason why my wife and I liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually. It's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience. The human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. This series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites Spooks and Hustle . ",positive
" When I saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s I was in awe of this film. Visually it was stunning and the events on campuses in Europe and USA made you relate with what Antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie: blowing up in your mind the tyrannical establishments and big business interests. The repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water painting a plane in psychedelic designs (even the staid British Airways did it a few years ago) are some of the images that were copied by advertising personnel all over the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd increased their fan following after the film was released. You see this film some 30 years later and you begin to wonder why the same film has lost its appeal. Today anti-establishment films have more substance--facts documentation fine performances and superb screenplays. Antonioni seems to be out-of-date; a flawed genius. Even viewing Antonioni's Blow Up today gives you the similar feeling that he is passe. Zabriski Point has to be evaluated for what it was when it was released. It was a great film if you were to see it on a wide Panavision screen as opposed to the dwarfed TV screens. The visual and aural (Mick Jagger Kieth Richards Pink Floyd et al.) allure of the film still remains. The lead pair were not great actors but they were cute and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in USA extending the reality of the non-conformist values he personified in the film. Today Antonioni seems out of sync. But watch carefully and you will appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors--Rod Taylor G.D. Spradling the ladies at the swimming pool the cops at the air-strip. The real sounds in contrast are from the non-conformists. Antonioni was relevant 30 years ago but his grasp of the medium cannot be questioned even today. He knew what he was doing. ",positive
" This is a gory mess and pretty convincing. Corbin Bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner. Linda Hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her the little tryst with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile! The last half hour of the movie is devoted to Bernson's character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called Virginya Keehne. An extremely talented performer she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off. Nice legs too! ",positive
" This has to be one of the best movies to come out of HK in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title. Loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with Sam Lee's impossibly believable insane behavior and Edison's portrayal of a killer machine which totally reversed his normal idol image. i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie. However i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe. Makes you think about what is life about really. ",positive
" Principally it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the contest but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else or they shows also the period before or after this fact here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts. It could also be seen as a kind of documentary. The movie focalize to these two people showing as normal they were not like common heroes because the revolution come from people. Although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just capitaes as the main characters. Nice colors and lights during the whole movie excellent work for the director being her first movie she doesn't fall to the banal way. Well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd. The character of Maia (main one)is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi able to show Maia's limits this not-being an hero. ",positive
" My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him. I am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood he connects to this movie. On January 27th he will turn 47 years old and I would like to be able to obtain this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me obtain this movie? Thanking you in advance Dolly Crout-Soto Deerfield Beach FL ",positive
" I wish that '70s show would come back on television. It was the greatest show ever!!! They should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing. But I wish it would come back and make more episodes. Please come back... The show was absolutely hilarious. You couldn't laugh without seeing an episode. There is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when Hyde and Jackie were going out with each other. Those were the best episodes. That '70s show is the best .... It will be and always will be the best show ever. It was really sad when the show ended. They should make new episodes. ",positive
" As I reach the backside of 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed drug influenced teens of today. It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today. This film drives that point home to the core. If you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film. From KISS-posters to an Angel concert this movie rocks ! Watch for a young Laura Dern. Why they didn't have more songs from the Runaways I'll never know ? I did have a problem with Randy Quaid's character deflowering a 16 year old girl. While he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude's house. The cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff. Foxes belongs right there with Over the Edge Fast Times Dazed & Confused and Kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks. I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all. ",positive
" ABC has done more for this show by allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast of this show. At first the show was watchable and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast. The hour lesson after John's death in real-life struck home to me. I lost my father at 17 years old and could sympathize and understand their pain and agony. ABC should be proud to maintain this show and even preserve this as John's final wish. This show has matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmys. ",positive

" This is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesn't appear literally until half way in. Nevertheless I was engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady. Curtis though competent as the falsely accused Scott Henderson looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards (perhaps he should have shaved his moustache) and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe I found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex. He is no stock villain. Superb character actor Elisha Cook Jr. is again in top form as the 'little man with big ambitions.' His drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism. This movie however is carried by the very capable and comely Ella Raines as the devoted would be lover of Henderson Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. This is the first of her work I have seen and I am definitely inclined to see her other roles. The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent. All in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to. Recommended 8/10. ",positive
" As drunken millionaire playboy Arthur Bach Dudley Moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood. As it turned out the role fit Moore so perfectly it trapped him as an actor as well. Many disappointments soon followed (including this film's pale sequel) yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunk scenes are forced parts of the film are wobbly but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives Oscar-winner John Gielgud a sly dryly amusing role as Arthur's valet Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport. Liza Minnelli (as a blue-collar love-interest) is sassy in a low-key and Moore is brash but deft and lively; he never shook off the shadow of Arthur but at least we have this document of a career high-point to cherish. *** from **** ",positive
" I had low expectations for this movie but I was looking for something unchallenging for an evening. I walked out of the theatre totally delighted and somewhat surprised. This is a very fine baseball tribute film and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role and I was touched by his performance. Definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time! ",positive
" This movie was beautiful. It was full of memorable imagery good acting and touching subject matter. It would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in the story's unfolding and presentation. There were a few cheesy shots but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can conjure is there wasn't a ton of details. However this movie wasn't created to explain every element of Joseph Smith's life ministry triumphs controversies failures etc.; it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time.

" Before seeing this I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated Emmanuelle series starring Sylvia Kristel. It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be. It actually has a story and it is very romantic indeed. What makes 'Yellow Emanuelle' so good is it's leading heroine the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee. She plays her character Emy Wong so sweetly that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her. Emy Wong is a much-respected doctor statuesque with a regal quality. She comes from an important old family where ancient customs are still practiced. Emy will remain a virgin until she is married to a man she has never met. The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage. It is simply how it is done in her world. However she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works. Emy decides to do away with custom and she gives herself to her Western man. But only after a very long courtship as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman. Her pilot George is a good guy and promises to marry Emy so that she doesn't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society. Neither one counts on a third party one Ilona Staller who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games. Emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her. Her place in society is gone she has been debased. The film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud elegant woman gives up her career as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution. I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale. I was on the edge of my seat when George blows back into town and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working as a prostitute! Classic drama. I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama. One would expect lots of sex and nudity here but there is not much. And when there is it is totally non-exploitative and very artsy and soft-core. If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle with Sylvia Kristel than you most likely will appreciate this lesser known classic. I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details. The whole segment where Emy takes George to her fathers house on the island is really nice. Her father shows George and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees. He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees. Totally unexpected. After catching it on late night cable TV years ago I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film. When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer. More sex? No more melodrama. For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease! I actually preferred the cable version better. I am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on DVD. I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70's soundtrack. While watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare and quite special. I recommend it to thoughtful viewers who don't need sex and violence to maintain their interest. ",positive
" I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times as if they were making it up as they went along but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools? Arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! A remarkably atmospheric well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man. All in all: wonderful. ",positive
" William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buy an old house where a brutal murder happened years ago in very bad condition with the intention of restoring it. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and become friends of their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However eerie events happen in the house inclusive the death of Sophie's cat. In Sophie's birthday party a pipe leaks blood and they leave the place disclosing a secret later. The House That Bled to Death is a scary and one of the best episodes of the series Hammer House of Horror . The fantastic twist disclosing a secret and the tragic conclusion are really excellent. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): A Casa Que Sangrou Até Morrer ( The House That Bled to Death ) ",positive
" A 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. That is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic coming of age film from Director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962 two giants of the coming of age genre. Here he directs newcomers in the principal roles: Reese Witherspoon in her film debut as the 14 year old girl; Emily Warfield as the older sister; Jason London as Court the 17 year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt never striking a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good as well. The film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis who was in his 70's when this was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957 caring strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good also as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweet-natured film that packs an emotional wallop. To date this is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the very best films of 1991. **** of 4 stars. ",positive
" Rohmer strays from his usual portraits of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution. What's more attractive about La Anglaise... (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetics that Rohmer has achieved. The images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures. In some moments you can't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in Louvre Musseum. Every shot is like a piece of art. *My rate: 7.5/10 ---------------- -------------- - ------------ ------------------- ",positive
" I've noticed that a lot of people who post on the Kerching! board seem to hate this show which I actually find very surprising. I think it's one of the best British kids' shows there is. It's a shame it's ending because it's very funny (if a bit cheesy sometimes) and has great characters. The main character is a little like Del Boy although quite a lot smarter. With his 2 best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mum by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of Rudeboy . His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is simple minded and the comic relief character). Throughout the show some characters have left and new ones have come in but it's always been entertaining and improving. ",positive
" This is a really fun breezy light hearted romantic comedy. You cannot go wrong with Meg Ryan's cute perkiness combined with Albert Einstein's genius. Normally I'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people now deceased and not able to defend themselves but I think the late Einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one. It's the 1950's...Princeton New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a pretty young scatter brained mathematician Catherine (Meg Ryan) who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk a behavioral researcher named James merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children. However it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). As she doesn't think Ed is intelligent enough her uncle none other than Albert Einstein plays match maker assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed appear suitably smart so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist...naturally with amusing results. Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self and pulls off the character of Einstein quite effectively. With his three professorial buddies Kurt Nathan and Boris a lot of laughs ensue. The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one (outrageous) step further. If you suspend all logic you can almost imagine this silly story happening! It might not be rocket science (despite its main character) but it is a wonderful sweet refreshing movie. One of the best of the comedy romance genre. ",positive
" I recently purchassed the very underrated Dreamcast and went off into town to find some games to use them on. I bought Soul Calibur (A classic) and then i stepped across the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2 and have played Res Evil 3 numerous occasions and i have been impressed with all of them especially no.1 which has to go down in history has a classic. But none of them 3 come anywhere near to the dreamcast attempt of Brilliant Gory Gameplay. If its just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort ive never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me. Anyway the story carrys on from the 2nd story in which Claire Redfield searches for her Brother (Chris - from the 1st story) who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation. Little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them 3 times in the previous storys. So aiding Claire with the assistant of super brat Steve u must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother. The 2nd CD enables you to control Chris thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear. The control are very slick and the movement of the characters are magnificently realistic when the character notices danger he/she faces the direction it is coming from. PURE GENIUS!! Overall i gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop!!. Please purchase this game as soon as possible. ",positive
" 'The Student of Prague' is an early feature-length horror drama or rather it is an autorenfilm (i.e. an author's film). This film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend respectability to cinéma or just make a profit by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen. Fortunately the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Musset's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe it centres on the doppelgänger theme. Unfortunately the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make Paul Wegener appear twice within scenes. Guido Seeber was a special effects wizard for his day but he's not very good at positioning the camera or moving it. Film scholar Leon Hunt (printed in Early Cinema: Space Frame Narrative ) however has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme: characters being split by left/right near/far and frontal/diagonal framing of characters and shots. Regardless the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position which is noticeably primitive. Worse is the lack of editing; there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. None of this is unusual for 1913 but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time including the better parts of 'Atlantis' (August Blom 1913) 'Twilight of a Woman's Soul' (Yevgeni Bauer 1913) and the short films of D.W. Griffith. An expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a vastly superior remake. Furthermore the remake has a reason for the Lyduschka character other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. Here the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around seemingly with a cloak of invisibility. I know their world is silent to me but I assume with their lips moving and such that their world would not be silent to them so how can Lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed? Nevertheless this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. Wegener who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film in addition to playing the lead would later play the title role and co-direct 'The Golem' in 1920--helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in German silent cinéma. (Note: The first version I viewed was about an hour long (surely not quite complete) and was in poor condition with faces bleached at times and such. I'm not sure who was the distributor. I've also since seen the Alpha DVD which at 41 minutes is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards but is visually not as bad. The repetitive score is best muted though.) ",positive
" I thought this movie was very well done. Taking place in the mid 1950's everything looked accurate to me. It was well cast and believable. I don't usually care much for this type of movie because they just don't have any depth but I felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them. It did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. This movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups. After the movie was over I wished there was a part two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on TV or rent it... ",positive
" Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the 'heroes' such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover) Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand man) and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible. Even from the first scene when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him sunshine and had a glint in his eye as he looked down at me his hand on me shoulder it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with Ned Kelly the underdog. Besides don't all Aussies love an underdog? ",positive
" Before films like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' 'Suspiria ' and 'Halloween' changed the view of horror forever there was a more Gothic and far less violent era in the genre. Films like the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemary's Baby' were what scared and thrilled audiences throughout the 60s and early 70s. I can't tell you how many times I rented this film during my childhood but I did because there was something about it. I didn't want to limit myself to the slasher and zombies movies of the 70s and 80s and films like this production from the famous but sadly long gone Amicus film company were a good start. Pros: A grand eerie music score. Strong performances from a stellar cast. Brilliant cinematography. Plenty good old fashioned thrills and chills especially in the first and last vignettes. Some haunting moments and images. Moves at a slow but stead pace. The house is one spooky oppressive dwelling. Great production design and set decoration which give the film a real old Gothic horror feel. Depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on gore and gratuitous nudity for it's thrills. Cons: Some pacing issues in the first half. Aside from the 'The Cloak ' the rest of the stories feel like they've been done before. Clichés galore. The second story 'Waxworks ' has fine acting and it's moments but is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense. The low budget really shows at times. Final thoughts: After seeing this film for the first time in many years I can see why I rented it so frequently. It's not a masterpiece by any means but it's a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. Watch this one with the lights off. My rating: 3.5/5 ",positive
" Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I have not read the book so I really didn't know that much about the plot and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The film also stars Toni Collette(Who has okay but has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger(Who has also been better but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming(Who I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam(Who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that was not what it needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching.

" The year is 1896.Jeff Webster (James Stewart) doesn't like people.There's only one friend he's got and he's Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) an old sympathetic man.They're driving a cattle herd with them.That would be their key to richness.In Skagway they run into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle.Now Jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the U.S. Canadian border to Dawson.Now they have a group of other people with them like the ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet).There the two men get into the gold business.Anthony Mann's and James Stewart's fourth collaboration The Far Country (1954) is a fine western indeed.The acting work is superb.Walter Brennan makes a terrific sidekick to Stewart.Ruth Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet's delightful.Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris.The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in smaller roles.It's fantastic to watch how Jimmy Stewart overcome's all the troubles in his way.There's just the man and his rifle.But also he's vulnerable.

" question: how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers Walther Mathau in full furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man mode? answer: quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as George Burns does here. I know nothing of Vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine. Richard Benjamin is very funny as straight man - trying to get at Burns through the window etc. Even the small parts are great. There are so many funny scenes Mathau messing up the commercial Burns repeating his answers as if senile... A delight. Enterrrrrr! ",positive
" I LOVED this movie! I am biased seeing as I am a huge Disney fan but I really enjoyed myself. The action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going! This is a bit of a departure for Disney they don't spend quite as much time on character development (my husband pointed this out)and there are no musical numbers. It is strictly action adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney be they young or old. ",positive
" I watch a lot of films good bad and indifferent; there is usually something of interest to fixate upon even if it is only set design or the reliable labor of a good character actor or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured forever. However I was quite pleasantly surprised by this film one I had never seen before. Graham Greene has been translated into film many times of course in such masterpieces as Thin Man and in lesser vehicles. Confidential Agent is one of those lesser vehicles yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway despite lackluster direction the incongruity of Bacall and Boyer's depictions as (respectively) British and Spanish and the almost complete non-existence of any chemistry between the two leads. In some ways this last problem actually begins to work in the film's favor for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person's tragedy? The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from Greene's complex and guilt-ridden psychology which pervades the film. I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull and I can understand that. Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world. I was compelled to watch not by any great acting (although Boyer is marvelous as usual managing to convey a rich mixture of world-weariness tragedy hope and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes) but by the down-spiraling rush of one man's slim hopes against a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What good is love in the face of death? Where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin? The film does not rise to the level of art and thus cannot hope to answer such questions but it is much more than mere entertainment and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn. The lack of glitz of bubble of narrative bounce help to make this movie very worthwhile. And there is no happy ending for history wrote the ending. ",positive
" Just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before. It just keeps getting better and better. You simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech the slow deliberate action everything being exactly in place. Truly one of the great ones and definitely my all-time favourite!!!

" This will be a different kind of review. I've seen this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I'd seen by Ashley Judd and she was great and I've enjoyed every other thing I've seen her in. Sundance's reaction made an impression on me too as did the director Victor Nunez who has directed and written several movies about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I've seen nothing with which to compare it. The plot speaks less to me than the surroundings. Well I told you it would be a different kind of review. ",positive
" What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MANY! This movie isn't like that. It is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both likable and unlikable. Downside: Not enough character development & some plot lines left twisting in the wind. Upside: Forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives. Well acted by: Scott Cohen Judd Hirsch Susan Floyd Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. Contains some good lighthearted humor. ",positive
" Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema. Not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in British life. Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th Century Duke of Burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 years. Accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which has never been officially rescinded) to state that that particular London street had been declared Burgandian soil which means that in the eyes of international law Pemberton and the other local residents are no longer British subjects but natives of Burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it's own right and a law unto itself. This sets the war-battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of English law and jurisdiction so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books destroy and ignore their clothing coupons flagrantly disregard British licencing laws etc declaring themselves fully independent from Britain. However what then happens is ever spiv black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the 'border' into Burgundy as a refuge from the law and post-war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods and half of London's consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration making their quiet happy little haven a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that. Appealing to Whitehall for assistance they are told that due to developments this is now a matter of foreign policy which His Majesty's Government is reluctant to become involved which leaves the residents high and dry. They do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of Pimlico. Eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege with the Bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food but never the less fighting on in true British style. As one Bugundian resident quotes we're English and we always were English and it's just because we are English we are fighting so hard to be Bugundians A sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of London learn of the poor Bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades. Will Whitehall who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it's knees by this new batch of foreigners especially as these ones are English!!!! Great tale and great fun throughout. Not to be missed. ",positive
" The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was a Italian sexual comedy that starred the one time Bond girl Ursula Andress. Man was she hot in this movie.. She was stacked and built like a *@#% brick house. Ursula was smoking hot in this movie. I have never seen a nurse's outfit that filled out before. Ms. Andress stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man. Even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots. One night the nurse decides to take the grandson's temperature and give some needed T.L.C. to her ancient client. The old man takes to his nurse and this angers the rest of the family. What kind of job did the family hire her out to do? Will the geezer fall for her car giver? How can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family? To find out you need to find a copy of the SENSUOUS NURSE!! Italian but badly dubbed into English. Highly recommended.

" This is the fifth von Trier film I have seen. I believe that he is the only director to whom I have given such a high score on all his movies. Four of them The Element of Crime Europa Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark I have given a 10 and one The Idiots I have given a 9 (and I have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since I first saw it although I'd like to see it once more before I do). He has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors. I tend to agree with him. I cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films. In 50 years when von Trier retires he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet) and there will be classes taught in his name. He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time. It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this. About Europa itself I'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong. I think that's the point. This film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level. This is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: Max von Sydow's narration. We are hypnotized or von Trier is hypnotized and this is our/his subconscious mind. I'm inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of Europe concerns me an American very little. This framing is also clear if you have seen The Element of Crime an even more brilliant film than this (although I am disputing that in my mind; what Europa needs more than anything is a proper release on DVD hopefully Criterion again with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture; then I am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von Trier's other films). In The Element of Crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing Fisher a European detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish. The first words of that film are Fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track. And whenever Fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story. He even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line. Something along the lines of Do you understand the difference between good and evil? The hypnotist laughs and says Now Fisher she didn't really say that did she? So the key to interpreting Europa almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime is that we are deep in our/von Trier's subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone. What does the train itself symbolize? Consider it internally and only then discuss it externally. Europa is a great film a masterpiece. I was never bored by it even though I watched it at 3 am. The perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic. ",positive
" Dressed to Kill is surely one of the best horror/thriller movies ever made.It's taut stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and violence.The acting is pretty good the orchestral score by Pino Donaggio is unforgettable and there's plenty of surprises to keep thriller fans intrigued. Dressed to Kill is a murder mystery that involves a sexually frustrated housewife(Angie Dickinson) her teenage son(Keith Gordon) her psychoanalyst(Michael Caine) and a high price call girl(Nancy Allen).The murderer in the film is a transsexual named Bobbi who is also one of Caine's patients.The film is full of breathtaking moments:the infamous elevator murder scene is extremely stylish and pretty gory as well.Highly recommended.

" I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful in it. Plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt. (And is absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped to inspire a role-playing game I thoroughly enjoy Mage: The Awakening. I've shown it at various LARP after-parties and it's always a big hit. D&D love and Jeff-squeeing aside it's not exactly a masterpiece but it's well-done and thoroughly enjoyable. The plot is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places. A good way to spend an evening. ",positive
" In answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of Jess's brother here is my response: The role of Jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer/Norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how Jess's brother turned out. There are various instances where Brad Pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there so Craig Sheffer's character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film.

" After having watched Guinea Pig two questions come in mind ( besides 'Am I really a psychopath to watch that ?' ) : 'Is it a snuff ?' The answer is no ; although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie I've ever seen. And then : 'Where the hell have they found that girl ?'. Because she gets tortured for '45 min without any reasons given ( in fact there is nothing else in this movie !) : Fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots ... and many more until the final scene ( I'm still not sure how they did that ). Because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene' it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money. So what were her ( their ) motivations ? I saw it in japonese without subtitles but it's not a problem ( no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes ). I haven't seen yet all the serial but the first Guinea Pig is not known for being the best one. Still I've rated 8 because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good ( ask Charlie Sheen the actor ). But I think they could have gone further which they did in the following ones. Another movie I'm hiding from my parents. 8/10 ",positive
" Distortion is a disturbing haunting film about life imitating art and art reflecting life. Haim Bouzaglo the director of the film plays the role of Haim Bouzaglo artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friend's documentary. As an Arab suicide bomber disguised in skullcap and American t-shirt wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves Haim transcribes his girl friend's life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors' lives during rehearsals. But the bomber has already struck and Haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier. Despite the manipulation of time and space the story is crystal clear comprehensive and absorbing a brilliant commentary on the distortion of everyday Israeli life where the political is intertwined with the personal where everyone lives on the edge and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone else's dramatic narrative. Bouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone else's production brilliantly. We are always voyeurs seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the real director chooses to reveal. To remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy Bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom (sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop) and repeatedly frames his views within TV video or security screens. Actors play the role of actors who represent the real characters played by actors. Of course each of the actors is the star of his or her own production only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actor's personal films. The detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play. The actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for tips on how to play the role is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes and they attend a cast party as their real selves. Despite this multiplicity of views there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative: the playwright searches for subject matter the bomber seeks a target and the detective stalks the filmmaker. Nor is there any difficulty locating Bouzaglo's ultimate targetenervated and impotent Israel fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action. Israel is Bouzaglo the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play. Israel is also the bankrupt soldier-entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmaker's documentary the cheating actors and actresses and the cuckolded husband. They are all Israel because they are all helpless caught in inaction or aimless action as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target. All the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep score of victims. There is personal triumph vindication perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film but viewers will be left aching for the state of Israel even as they are filled with admiration for Bouzaglo's memorable rendition of a nation's plight within the telling of an individual's story.

" Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best of a slew of prison-set horror films(like Death House or The Chair )in the late 80's.Twenty years before guard Lane Smith had wrongfully executed a condemned man.Now he is the warden of the newly re-opened prison and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge.This atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence.Viggo Mortensen Tiny Lister Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are onhand for the entertaining carnage.

" What the movie The 60s really represents (to those of us who growled around in the belly of America in those times) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated stereotyped characters the genuineness of the issues remains clear. Not only were those radical times of change but also very confusing times. Two basic things changed our world then: the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the overwhelming influence of the media. Those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized. From chaos came sensitivity from disorder came values. Bear in mind however that the bulk of Americans were not involved in this... they worked they played they watched the news... and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities... the Civil Rights workers the Political Activists the Anti-War efforts the War on Poverty.... The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular was well reflected although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored... and at worst misrepresented.. Middle class Americans weren't all standing around angrily holding baseball bats or disowning their wayward daughters. They were confused too. Let us not forget how Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers and how The Beatles began an onslaught that killed the Folk-Protest Movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie or even any mention of them. I think if you didn't live the decade you might not have a sense of what the movie is about the overall picture is a bit dim. At one point I held down a steady job while my sister lived at the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At another point I was in Haight Asbury and in the Detroit Riots while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut. Roles were constantly changing. The movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family. They represent the hippie child the political activist and the active military personnel. Dad represents the typical attitudes and mom represents the voice of reason tolerance and sometimes compromise... for the sake of peace. The Black family comprises a minister and his son... disproportionately I think. I assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations or else the film would have become a long boring documentary. Dad's message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos. It was clearly a message directed to today's youth. We are looking at a unique solution to social problems and also how issues divide us... The 60s were unusual in that way and only the Roaring 20s compare. In other words this movie has a moral after all. In the end it is our Collective Individualism that survives. Put that in your oxymoron list. Everyone was a God a Guru or a free-spirited genius in the 60s. It was a time of magic and madness. No one will ever nail the 60s down right... it was too diverse (this movie is close). At least we can say we are not ashamed of it that we learned and grew from it and that for once a generation shaped and changed America... for the better. ",positive
" A film about wannabee's never-were's and less-than-heroes making it against all odds. Where have we heard that before. But when the unfortunates are the Shoveller the Blue Raja and Mr.Furious you know this is not your conventional rags to riches story. A classic performance by Eddie Izzard as Tony P. one of the Disco boys leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain shows actual thought went into the casting. Even Greg Kinnear at first glance an odd choice for the role of Captain Amazing turns out spot on. Watch this film if you're sick of comic-gone-film stereotypes. Why couldn't anger be a super power?

" This movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy. He examines the ever illusive question of 'who am I' and 'what is I?' It's a courageous and thought provoking enterprise. There is a shipload of beautiful images dream-inspired Escher-like paradoxes reminiscent of the hand drawing itself or rather erasing itself. More and more we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film we see him phoning with his wife who left for Peru leaving him to take care of their baby a task he performs with less and less attention until he's so absorbed in his dilemma's that he hardly looks at the child anymore. His wife comes back and makes a scene destroys his notes and helping him go over the last treshold until he erases him-self. Interspersed with eye-pleasing and I-destructing images the story is mainly philosophical. It's about the veils of Maya the world of illusion. The paradox of the movie however is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop. During the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophising the movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie. If that was the purpose of the maker he succeeded quite well.

" A Christmas Together actually came before my time but I've been raised on John Denver and the songs from this special were always my family's Christmas music. For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago I was finally able to track down a video of it on Ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years I got to see John and the Muppets in action for myself. If you ever get the chance it's a lot of fun--great music heart-warming and cheesy. It's also interesting to see the 70's versions of the Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. I believe Denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this--I guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the Muppets but I'm glad he did. Even if you can't track down the video the soundtrack is worth it too. It has some Muppified traditional favorites but also some original Denver tunes as well. ",positive

" I have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore I loved how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close. I think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... Gojoe has the action story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer. I strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the U.S. My one complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything away--sorry). ",positive
" Brian Dennehy Bill Paxton Joe Pantalino and best of all Jeff Fahey all in one film. Wow is all I can think to say about that. These are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and they work beautifully together. It's like poetry the way they play off each other and ooze the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for eons for even shooting the film. The film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time and the four stars help the re-watch-ability to a great extent. I cannot describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on screen the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves it almost brought a tear to my eyes. A good film a great cast go see. Why? Four words Fahey Dennehy Paxton Pantalino. ",positive
" CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. It won the award Best Short Film at The 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also won the Excellence Prize at Japan's Media Arts Festival. When little kitten Nyaako's soul is stolen by Death she and her brother Nyatta embark on a bizarre journey to get it back. In the surreal dreamscape of the Other Side they encounter many fantastic characters and remarkable often disturbing adventures. CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original stunningly beautiful and possess a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surrealistic (there are no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and gory. So it is more an anime for adults than children (they may not understand at all!). A great journey for those who get the chance to see this absolute masterpiece. An must-see! ",positive
" Well the movie isn't exactly funny. Okay I admit there are a few HUMOROUS lines but definitely nothing that is laugh-out-loud funny. For example: Right before a steamy sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male costars sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key he tells her Okay don't go anywhere. See humorous but not funny. The plot and acting are pretty good. But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but rewind and re-watch. There are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines. Overall 5 stars. I'd only give it three if not for Erika Eleniak. ",positive
" Interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity. The injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience..A must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life. I am eagerly looking forward to your next product.Hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Excellent work ......Joanne ",positive
" Excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years.

And that river haunts me. Worth seeing. ",positive
" Paul Verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'Basic Instinct' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why. The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve (played by Jeroen Krabbé); a gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. While there he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills him. Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things I like best about him. This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesn't happen very often!). I wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but you'll see what I mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one I've mentioned but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions another one has a pipe sent through his skull a boat is smashed in half...lovely. The acting in The Fourth Man isn't anything to write home about but it's solid throughout. Jeroen Krabbé holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct but the original fatale did it best. Paul Verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and it's a shame that he doesn't put it to better use. Of all the Verhoeven films I've seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me it's worth the effort. ",positive
" Shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the Peter O'Donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films. You can read the strip currently in the reprints from Titan Books or in Comics Revue monthly. It is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time. The movie isn't great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest. On the DVD extras the interview with Quentin Tarentino who is obviously stoned is a gas. Some people have faulted Tarentino for associating his name with the film but without him it would never have been made. He is a Modesty Blaise fan and picked a good writer and director. All things considered worth 8 stars. ",positive
" Pushing Daisies truly is a landmark in Television as an art form. Everything seems to pay homage to Amelie and Tim Burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not. It is just Brilliant. I have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the Directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since The Shield and The Wire (ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that it has no comparisons on television). Truly addictive and an absolute pleasure. Perhaps like one of the Piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways. ",positive

Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra Nargis Bagheri Daisy Boppana). ",positive
" Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. I think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the Matrix style of films. Europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. The back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like Hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions. I could talk about the effects more but I think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own and really heighten the drama of the film. A film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not. 10/10 Don't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors. ",positive
" I must admit that at the beginning I was sort of reticent about watching this movie. I thought it was this stupid little romantic film about a French woman who meets in the train an American and decides to visit Vienna with him. I was not actually enchanted about this kind of script since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie. Still I watched it! And I was amazed... Before Sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth we are sentenced to death or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity or that we humans can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales. The ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months at six o'clock in Vienna's station) -in our optimism we sincerely hope so. The actors acted in a very good manner so that I began to believe that I myself could live a love-story just like this. ",positive
" The film is very complete in what it is keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder one simply cannot go wrong. The very plot in itself the very story and essence of the film is entertaining. It is the sort of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do so much with and in this case he really did do a lot with it. From beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going and the creativity that is behind this story is first class. I felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls -- the action flowing neatly quickly and tightly from one scene to the next. It demonstrates just how far people can go: so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones and to do such acts of evil in the name of 'God' when they are disillusioned as in this case. It also is sometimes interesting in its' twists & takes on the concept of morality as a whole. Overall this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks but I would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out -- it is very much so worth your time. ",positive
" Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father an impudent violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the Pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles all influence eachother but each is seperate and utterly unique. He changes completely with each character he takes on. And I'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything. Anything. As Cristy Brown he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character and he does not pity the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human. This movie despite small scene-transition faults and the like is an inspiration. Yes it's predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isn't a Hollywood movie. My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen Peter and her friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. I'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated. Wheel out the cripple! And his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again again and I never get tired of Cristy's perspicacious eyes twitching and guttural speeches. A must-see. Fo sho yo! ",positive
" Almost 30 years later I recall this original PBS film as almost unbearably tender. Periodically I check here at IMDb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a DVD. It's September of 2004 and I keep hoping -- deep sigh. One of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime-time evening soap; the other Frances Lee McCain was seen in small roles here and there for a few years. But nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced as I recall it on a short-lived PBS series which showcased original screenplays by new and up-and-coming playwrights. I watched it every time it was shown on PBS maybe 2 or 3 times. That was before the era of VCRs so I have no record of it except in my mind's eye. 12/31/2006 addition to above: Happy New Year ladies! This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that the DVDs are burned from the writer's own personal copy. ",positive
" Los Angeles TV news reporter Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach of The Spy Who Loved Me fame) and her two assistants Karen (the appealingly spunky Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the pretty Lois Young who not only gets killed first but also bares her yummy bod in a tasty gratuitous nude bath scene) go to Solvang California to cover an annual Danish festival. Since all the local hotels are booked solid the three lovely ladies are forced to seek room and board at a swanky but foreboding remote mansion owned by freaky Ernest Keller (deliciously played to geeky perfection by the late great Sydney Lassick) and his meek sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately Keller has one very nasty and lethal dark family secret residing in his dank basement: a portly pathetic diapered incest-spawned man-child Mongoloid named Junior (an alternately touching and terrifying portrayal by Stephen Furst; Flounder in Animal House ) who naturally gets loose and wreaks some murderous havoc. Capably directed by Danny Steinmann with uniformly fine acting from a sturdy cast a compellingly perverse plot excellent make-up by Craig Reardon a nicely creepy atmosphere a wonderfully wild climax a slow but steady pace likable well-drawn characters and a surprisingly heart-breaking final freeze frame (the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch) this unjustly overlooked early 80's psycho sleeper is well worth checking out.

" This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have romance clever witticisms great acting and a fair dose of magic. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the Neil Gaiman novel which I am now looking to read) and colorful characters. One of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is. Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel. Original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy. ",positive
" This movie is a riot. I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies. I've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. But this one is wall to wall great lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in. The movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. Other than that it's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations. I'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around. You have to see it two or three times to get it all in. As far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit it's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that. All the characters are great. It's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. No victims in this movie. Also thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. You just wish that women like her really existed. She's not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite. If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it. I assure you the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give away all the good jokes. Just some of the mediocre ones. Oh and one more thing. I hope critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list. This means you Ebert!!! ",positive
" The selection of Sylvester Stallone to perform the protagonist by Renny Harlin is commendable since Stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But to compare Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion. The excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws. The heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before. The biting cold of the snow capped Alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation. The forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end. Good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then. Apart from the filthy language/parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years.

" I'm not great at writing reviews so I'll just spout my opinions... I loved this series at first. The adventure the action the comedy the drama... I thought it was all brilliant. Anderson Tapping Shanks Judge Davis... I loved them all. Davis it seemed was the fifth-most important person in the cast. Not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I don't know whether it's because Hammond was more important that I realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to ****. The first seven seasons though were awesome. The movie Stargate seemed mediocre the first time I saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasn't the original intention a brilliant setup to the series. I recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the TV series then watch the movie again (you'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me) and then watch the rest of the TV series. The last three seasons of the series aren't nearly as good as the first seven but that doesn't mean they aren't good. It just means they're a letdown if you've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons. After you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series Stargate: Atlantis. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. EDIT on 7-18-08: I just found out that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It is a great loss. ",positive
" I believe that The Sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it. i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far the best one is definitely episode #3 Denial Anger Acceptance. This episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang. In the end he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath and that's my most favorite scene ever in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. And my # 2 most favorite character ever was Matthew Bevilaqua who was killed after attempting to murder Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him. My # 3 most favorite character is Sean Gismonte who was killed right after shooting Christopher. And finally my # 4 most favorite character is Chucky Signore one of Uncle Junior's henchmen. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All the awesome characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about the Sopranos. All the cool guys always get killed. You know what would be great to change about the Sopranos? They should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture Chris Tony Uncle Junior Silvio and Paulie because they need to get their revenge. Brendan Filone shall strike back!!!!!!!!!1 ",positive
" I first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on DVD. James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty a hardworking and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the Bureau is intercut with his family life which is not all rosy. His wife (an excellent portrayal by Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job and they even separate for a time; Chip's best friend and fellow agent Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in a gunfight; Chip's son Mike enlists in the Marines during World War II. Through it all the family carries on with bravery and dignity. The action sequences are quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. And the music by Max Steiner says it all; fidelity bravery and integrity. This country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and yes to J. Edgar Hoover as well. If Mr. Hoover's type of vigilance had been observed we might have been spared 9/11 the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we've had to put up with since his passing.

" I had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick. The music hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. The breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in Breakin' but I have to say that Breakin' 1&2 carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. It's a movie I will keep in my library but it's not a movie that I can watch over & over again just once in a blue moon. ",positive
" RKO had a reputation for making folksy homespun pieces of Americana. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) had been in films since she was a toddler. By 1933 she was in limbo - having played Ann Dvorak as a child in Three on a Match (1932) and a flower girl in both This Side of Heaven and The Key both in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembered Anne's work from a previous film and that's how she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a leaky boat the stolen brooch the red hair incident. Anne was so right for the role of the chatty heartwarming orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity her eagerness to please and also her fiery temper. O.P. Heggie was wonderful as the understanding Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley was fine as the firm Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger who had also been in films as a small child was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series was Mrs. Barry.

" After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of Joseph Smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew to be his path. I am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do.

" Caught this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I wasn't expecting a lot (though the festival's director told me it was one of the best films submitted). Five minutes into it I was sold. Shot in B & W on a shoestring budget this film is hilarious. The acting is solid the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid. The acting is probably the biggest revelation since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting. Not this one. It features one of the most convincing endearing and funny portrayals of a character with Tourette's Syndrome I've ever seen. The plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous. If you get the chance see this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (hope I got that right) deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience. ",positive
" While visiting Romania with his CIA dad Tony(Adam Arkin) quite a talented high school quarterback seen as the savior to lead his team finally to a victory over rival Simpson is told by a would-be palm-reader(..in Romania the people are not allowed many books so she took up palm reading)that he would be bitten by a werewolf( When the moon is full don't make any appointments..you will be busy. ). Well who would have thunk it..Tony is in fact bitten and his life would be forever changed. After his father unfortunately dies in a mishap within his bomb shelter(!)under odd circumstances(firing at his werewolf son inside a metallic bomb shelter isn't a very good idea especially if the bullet doesn't leave the room and bounces around like a pinball gone berserk) Tony travels the land through endless years until he's tired of packing and returns decades(..and many US Presidents)later to hopefully lead his football team to a win over Simpson..a task he abandoned long ago. What was once a very white clean-cut high school has indeed changed into a ghetto of drug use violence and perversion. To get an idea of what the early 80's Full Moon High school's prom party resembles think Studio 54 with teenagers.. Larry Cohen's parody of werewolf flicks among others things is crammed full of gags homages and in-jokes. My favorite sequences contain one in the sex-ed classroom where Tony reveals to the 80's class his werewolf transformation and the introductory scene to Dr. Brand(Alan Arkin who steals the film when Kenneth Mars isn't on screen) quite possibly the worst psychiatrist on Earth. His task to talk down a jumper leads to two men falling off a balcony..the jumper and a fireman (trying at first to talk him out of it) both fuming mad at Brand! Brand even tries to get Tony to sign a waver for his body's being donated to science so he can get his wife a fur coat! Kenneth Mars had me rolling in the floor as a homosexual football coach(..and later in the 80's as the Principal)who likes to pat his players on the behind..his scene where Tony's unloading the truth to the sex-ed class is classic. The film is loaded with inspired casting choices..just littered with funny characters and the cast interpretations..such as Ed McMahon as a very conservative military blowhard who actually looks identical to Joseph McCathy standing next to his photo in the bomb shelter(..always talking about commies) Joanne Nail as bulging eyed Ricky in present day who falls for the werewolf Elizabeth Hartman(A Patch of Blue)as a mousy nerdy sexually molested(..and molester)teacher who finds an attraction towards Tony James Dixon as a deputy(..his great scene has him stealing a line from his police chief reciting it to Dr. Brand who begins mouthing the words to himself for memorization) Roz Kelly as Jane an undyingly devoted female desiring Tony for only herself constantly demanding he ravish her and Bill Kirchenbauer as Flynn Tony's long-time pal and now the police chief who only got Jane after his friend left town. Can not forget JM J Bullock as Flynn's closeted gay son trying to fit in at the school hoping to find a dame with hilarious results. I like how the film pays homage to the werewolf genre such as when he's on the prowl..he's often referred to in the papers as Jack the Nipper because he likes to bite his victims on the cheek..and I'm not talking face. He's seen more as an annoyance than danger. The homages to Carrie and Psycho are nice and the violin shtick is also amusing. Cohen tosses so many zingers at the viewer eventually one has to stick. Obviously in a comedy such as this not every joke hits it's mark but many do. The cast makes this worthwhile. The film looks cheap on the typical Larry Cohen budget. Notice the 50's scenes where the obvious old cast members that would show up down the road wear glaring wigs. Loved Adam in the lead..he is the perfect foil for the gags that follow him and the zingers he lets fly from Cohen's script. The film moves quickly rarely catching a breath. I liked this horror comedy more than most it seems. ",positive
" What a perfect example of Less Is More... Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) only has 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks the facial expressions the physical drama the emotive gesture all combines to make a stronger impact. This is one of those top 5 movies I can't live without right up there with the classics like Road Warrior. If you liked this check out Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior and Braveheart both starring Mel Gibson. Also Gladiator with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in Soldier also. The Thirteenth Warrior starring Antonio Banderas and Blade Runner starring Harrison Ford. ",positive
" Ed Harris's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence that is he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it and that includes the formidable Sean Connery. The movie which is more than a bit sanctimonious comes alive only in the scenes when Harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict. It is breathtaking a master class in artistic control. The other cast members are all adept and Connery is reliable as is Fishbourne but the story itself packs no wallop. The plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers. This is the engine which drives the story right or wrong and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end. Still worth watching to see Harris in action. ",positive
" Maybe I'm being too generous with the rating...but I just love this movie! I've seen it so many times but every time I see it I fall in love with it all over again. It's just a simple romantic comedy with nothing huge or monumentous that happens. But I'm a big romantic and this movie *is* romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins and Walter Mathau is so funny. The scientists make me laugh so much...I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's such a clean good movie - and those are so rare now! My 20-year-old brother likes this movie too so it's not just a chick-flick. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh or if you're just lonely and need to *watch* a romance if you yourself can't participate in one. It's a good 'un! ",positive
" Jim Carrey shines in this beautiful movie. This is now one of my favorite movies. I read all about the making and I thought it was incredible how the did it. I can't wait till this comes out on DVD. I saw this in theaters so many times I can't even count how times I've seen it. ",positive
" Man on fire is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers I have ever seen. Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role in which he plays a body guard called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita the very smart enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things and acts in a very convincing manner she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated in order to fully understand it you must watch it a couple of times. This film is made in two parts there's the first hour where everyone is happy nothing's wrong everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part the rest of the film where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing when Creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and La Hermamdad that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita. Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance and so did Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality. If you like excellent slightly deranged suspenseful thrillers this is the one to see. The most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10 ",positive
" Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There were some noticeable goofs but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time. I did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and I found it pretty entertaining. It gets kind of silly at times but overall I recommend it. They probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores and some of the costume designs were pretty good. ",positive
" One of the unsung gems of the 1980's Scenes... features razor-sharp satire and outstanding performances from Arnetia Walker (how did she not get a ton of roles after this?)and Wallace Shawn. It's a delicious send-up of class warfare and the people in those classes. The writing is hilarious and the characters while not subtle are nuanced. And sorry but the Asian gangs (if you can call one Japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a gang ) were not put in for sociological value as another review implies they should been. The value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it. I found it creative funny and idiosyncratic. ",positive
" I have spent the last week watching John Cassavetes films - starting with 'a woman under the influence' and ending on 'opening night'. I am completely and utterly blown away in particular by these two films. from the first minute to the last in 'opening night' i was completely and utterly absorbed. i've only experienced it on a few occasions but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted from about two thirds in right through till the credits came up. everything about this film from the way it was shot the incredible performance of Gena Rowlands the credits the opening the music the plot the sense of depth the pace the tenderness the originality the characters the deft little moments.... for me is truly sublime. i couldn't agree more with the previous comment about taking it to a desert island because the sheer depth of this film is something to behold. if your unlucky enough to have a house fire i guarantee that instead of making a last ditch attempt to rescue that stash of money under your bed you'll be rescuing your copy of this film instead.

" Some war movies succeed where others do not and that can be judged from a variety of angles. The humanistic angle one where you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being under attack the camaraderie amongst soldiers the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat etc..) are always movies I find compelling. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film. This film succeeds on that level as well. It speaks of The Highest Honor and that honor is doing the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with Western thought but it is to the very end a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story. ",positive
" Wrapped in gorgeous English country backgrounds Emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways. Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a graceful intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess--and confidant--to a marriage which Emma takes the credit in matchmaking. Eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her she decides to match the vicar Mr. Elton (Alan Cummings) with her pretty young friend Harriet (Toni Collette). The result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out with Emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought. The film is full of Jane Austen's witty and wry characterizations. Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best portraying this maiden of a restrained polite society with wit and ease. Her growing romance with the unparalleled Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films. He is incredibly handsome in a modest relaxed way that is irresistible. He is certainly well-matched to Gwyneth Paltrow. Their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant has blossomed as he a family friend matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more. With a wry look or understated jab at Emma Northam's Knightley is a delight to watch. Other wonderful characterizations include the comic Juliet Stevenson Greta Scacchi Ewan McGregor Polly Walker and the talkative spinster Miss Bates who is very funny. Seeming shorter and more flowing than most Jane Austin adaptations Emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment. ",positive
" To Die For has it all.This film has a great cast. Lots and lots of romance and terror. Not too gory but still enough to appeal to horror fans. There are a lot more vampire love stories. If you are a fan of vampire love stories I strongly recommend this film-10/10. ",positive
" I don't think most of us would tend to apply the term must-see to action films but I was very impressed at how good this film was and it deservedly gets the must-see stamp from me. Mandy played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the late and great Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee) is recruited by Martin a professional thief to help pull off a diamond heist at a museum for a criminal syndicate and get rewarded handsomely for it. Little do they know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy a pair of lovebirds) who were spurned earlier by Mandy and Martin to get in on the deal are also planning to steal the diamond. How each pair of thieves plans out the heist is a thrill to watch. Things go awry as Martin and Mandy unknowingly find themselves a step behind Lucy and Tommy. You'll find yourself rooting for these thieves as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in its hands. Action fans will not be disappointed as there's a healthy dose of gun battles martial arts and hand-to-hand combat sequences. What is surprising is that it's not just the action that carries this film but the romance and laughs (and I don't mean your typical one-liners prevalent in action films) that sneak in. It's not easy to root for bad guys but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. A great film and one NOT to miss! 9 out of 10 ",positive
" Watched both parts twice. Enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very believable as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I do admit that I would have preferred seeing someone else as the Lady in Distress . Alison Doody should stick with modern and not period pieces. She didn't have the look of the woman of the 1800's. The rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well. I am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older. Age is inevitable but let's not hide from it. A man at 50+ can be much sexier (and Patrick truly is sexy) then a green youth no matter how pretty. Hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile. ",positive
" This is a delightful movie that is so over-the-top that my wife daughter and I found it irresistible. The plot is just crazy but rings true to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities. I particularly enjoyed Kevin Kline's and Sally Field's performances. I don't anyone better than Kline at playing THICKheaded. Field's character's truly desperate need for attention and affirmation -- and her almost bipolar swings in mood -- played nicely against the background of Field's famous (infamous?) You like me! Oscar exclamation. People who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world. I think this is the only movie where I didn't find myself impatient with Whoopi Goldberg characterization; I thought she was spot on in every note she struck. Robert Downey Jr. Teri Hatcher Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also first-rate as well. Just a great movie if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and LAUGH! ",positive
" Just as the new BSG wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting Caprica may not deliver what fans of the new BSG were expecting (for the most part). It is a very interesting if not somewhat self-involved show or at least the pilot is. If you're looking for the big CGI thrills of the (new) BSG you'll be sorely disappointed. If you liked the drama you'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with. The storyline does examine on how the Cylons were developed why Adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society. The writers also manage to tackle humans 'playing God(s)' and the creation or re-creation of 'human' life. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. I found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others but all in all it was promising. A small part of me wishes (or hopes) there might be some minor inklings of BSG in there (aside from the back story I mentioned) but that would probably convolute the storyline too much. Like BSG I'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me but it's way too early to tell. It would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series but I'm willing to give it a chance. Overall I thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before 'throwing in the (proverbial) towel'. ",positive
" Charleton Heston wore one James Franciscus wore one but Mark Wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth. I hope no one casts him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet movies but Estrella Warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way. Tim Burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at. Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain. She's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - Planet of the Apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors Tim Roth Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch. Superlative make up (a certain Oscar) costumes sets music make this the hit summer movie of 2001. ",positive
" De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors but this one was a hit-and-miss for me. A grinning idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milano. It is a detailed and sparkling story of the innocent poor masses complete with evil capitalists and trigger-happy police forces but slowly it evolves into a magic fantasy tale as the boy wonder Toto develops unlimited superhero powers. I had it up to here with the ever-smiling Toto after 10 minutes and when the magic took over I was left in the dust. There were so many wonderfully orchestrated shots so many good characters among the settlers that I kept thinking it was a waste the movie wasn't more serious with its material. The coupling of neorealism and fantasy comes out more as an experiment of the look-what-we-can-also-do-mum sort than as a fully developed piece of work/art. ",positive
" This movie is about development. People growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing. It has it all and more. There is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate. It is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role. This movie made me feel very human and proud of it and I suggest that this movie should be mandatory each Saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 of 10. PS: I admit it: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene. ",positive
" I have seen Maslin Beach a couple of times - both on free to air TV in Brisbane. I won't go into whether it is good bad or otherwise as others have well and truly covered this. I will say that it is so Australian. Only in Australia can we have a film about relationships among people spending the day as naked as the day they were born and to view it on free commercial television. I have a friend from the US who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free TV compared to her home country. Sex and the CIty and Huff are just too examples. Despite our Government trying to turn us into the 51st US State it is good to know at least some things remain truly Aussie ",positive
" New York I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films with each segment running around 10 minutes long. The shorts don't exactly relate but they all have something in common love. Every short is about finding love either if it's about a couple or just two strangers chitchatting.The film stars an ensemble cast among them Shia LaBeouf Natalie Portman Hayden Christensen Orlando Bloom Chris Cooper Andy Garcia Christina Ricci Irrfan Khan Robin Wright Penn Julie Christie Ethan Hawke Bradley Cooper Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise I was expecting a tremendous film; the problem is New York I Love You doesn't add up. It remains the sum of its parts. Some of the segments are funny original and interesting but others are so meaningless (Orlando Bloom/Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke/Maggie Q segments) that it's appalling. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Story-wise it seems like something a few film students could put together. Having said that the film has some great moments as well one of the best being the segment about an old couple played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman walking along in Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. And it's moments like this that made me as a viewer wish the film was more consistent because there's a lot of potential here. But as unsatisfying as the overall story ends up being for me the cinematography and soundtrack saved the all thing. The editing was perfect the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack couldn't be more fitting. In the end New York I Love You feels like an experimental film and as in most experiences there's highs and lows. It's how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine if he enjoys it or not. It might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others. 7/10 ",positive
" L'Hypothèse du tableau volé/The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting (1979) begins in the courtyard of an old three-story Parisian apartment building. Inside we meet The Collector an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure Impressionist-era painter Tonnerre. A narrator recites various epigrams about art and painting and then engages in a dialogue with The Collector who describes the paintings to us shows them to us tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down and then tells us he's going to show us something.... As he walks through a doorway we enter another world or worlds or perhaps to stretch to the limits other possible worlds. The Collector shows us through his apparently limitless house including a large yard full of trees with a hill; within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life or half-way to life as he walks us through various tableaux and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting of the work as a whole of a whole secret history behind the paintings the scandal the people in the paintings the novel that may have inspired the paintings. And so on and so on. Every room every description leads us deeper into a labyrinth and all the while The Collector and The Narrator engage in their separate monologues very occasionally verging into dialogue but mostly staying separate and different. I watched this a second time so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was and so challenging to think or write about. If I have a guess as to what it all adds up to it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation. An indicator might be found in two of the most amusing and inexplicable scenes are those in which The Collector poses some sexless plastic figurines -- in the second of them he also looks at photos taken of the figurines that mirror the poses in the paintings -- then he strides through his collection which is now partially composed of life-size versions of the figures. If we think too much about it and don't just enjoy it it all becomes just faceless plastic.... Whether I've come to any definite conclusions about L'Hypothèse du tableau volé or not I can say definitely that outside of the early (and contemporaneous) works of Peter Greenaway like A Walk Through H I've rarely been so enthralled by something so deep so serious so dense....and at heart so mischievous and fun.

" Well well....Roeg touched a bit of a nerve there didn't he? He was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters' descents into psychosis for a couple of decades but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) might be found in the bad old Catholic church the hipper-than-thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious. Worse still Theresa Russell's character - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. You know the realm of the ignorant and superstitious the sort of thing that the art-house cinephiles are supposed to be above. Oh the horror... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives. But they probably won't. Sure this film has some problems notably Talia Shire's delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun 1950s-style attire and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcock's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psychoanalyst). But sadly Nicolas Roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents. ",positive
" This is an Oriental fantasy about ¨thousand and one Arabian nights¨ plenty of incredible adventures fantasy witchery and wizardly. The malignant vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt)with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince Ahamad of Bagdad(attractive John Justin)who loses his throne then he escapes thanks a little thief named Abu(sympathetic Sabu). They arrive Basora where Ahamad and the princess(gorgeous June Duprez) fall in love. But prince and thief are haunted by Jaffar Ahamd is turned blind and Abu is become a dog. The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring a flying mechanic horse magic bow flying carpet and of course the colossal genie(overacting performed by Rex Ingram) who gives three wishes to Sabu the magic eye the figure of goddess Kali with several hands among others. This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time. Produced by London Fim's Alexander Korda and directed by the definitively credited Ludwing Berger Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a stunning screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson also dialogs writer and actor as Sultan fond to mechanic games. The WWII outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting then the three Korda brothers and collaborators traveled USA continuing there the filming in especial on Grand Cannon Colorado.The splendid visual and glimmer Technicolor cinematography setting and FX provoked the achieving three Oscars : Production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda Cinematography by George Perinal and Special effects by Osmond Borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn-out. Furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa. This vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs ",positive
" Bela Lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit (which was also the source of a feature film where Lugosi played the villain.) Lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way. Here Chandu returns from the East in order to help the Princess Nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of Ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult. This is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun. To be certain the pacing is a bit slack more akin to one of Principals (the producing studios) features then a rip roaring adventure but it's still enjoyable. This plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that hey I missed something . One of the trilogy of three good serials Lugosi made the others being SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps ",positive
" This is the moving tale of Scotland's legendary hero Rob Roy and his battles with the feudal landowners. Like Braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical. Despite their primarily fictional nature I rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two. The 13 Century William Wallace is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early 18th Century Rob Roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary Scotsman. The story revolves around a clan chieftain Robert Roy McGregor who lives in a Scottish highland cottage with his wife Mary and their two young sons. As the movie begins he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle. Rob Roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand Scottish pounds from a local noble the Marquis of Montrose in order to buy cattle to herd to market. He temporarily entrusts this money to his friend Alan McDonald. When both McDonald and the money turn up missing Rob Roy finds himself in conflict with Montrose as well as his despicable protégé Archibald Cunningham and his sleazy factor Killearn. Rob Roy's honour is also tested when Montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival the Duke of Argyle whom he wishes to accuse of being a Jacobite. The charismatic Liam Leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander Rob Roy an intelligent virile and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale. Personally I feel that this is Neeson's best performance his brogue (albeit Irish) adding authenticity for the average viewer. Rob Roy is a stubborn proud courageous and honest man whose word can be trusted. He is a loving husband & father and also touchingly loyal to his friend McDonald who is accused of robbing him. Tim Roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains Archibald Cunningham an egotistical ruthless strutting peacock. He is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women whether willing or otherwise. The pathetic Cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder rape and thievery. Also he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl Betty after she becomes pregnant with his child resulting in her suicide. John Hurt plays the arrogant and foppish Montrose who is eventually implied to be Cunningham's father. The movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between Rob Roy and Mary. Those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife! I think the phrase used by this pair 'How fine you are to me...' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema. The most compelling performance is possibly by Jessica Lange as Rob's wife Mary McGregor. Lacking make up she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother. The actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable Cunningham while the disgusting Killearn looks on. Her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace. I give Hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as Mary's pain and humiliation but nothing intended to sensationalize. Their kinsman Alastair McGregor shows emotional anguish when he learns of Mary's rape and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by Cunningham. Of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the Scottish highlands also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring. There are no grand battle scenes as in Braveheart but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham. This is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale. ",positive
" Well this might be one of the funniest movies of all time and Sandy gives a tour-de-force performance! Alas her career never quite took off but - at last - she will always be remembered for her three first-rate pictures: The King Of Comedy Dallas Doll and Without You I'm Nothing . She dons into different personas from New York socialite to Diana Ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce tender and sensual philosophical and melancholic she convinces the audience in every scene and she actually IS really pretty . Watch this one (if you're not from Iowa) you'll certainly enjoy it!! ",positive
" Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a film for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers. As for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes. Where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional Hong Kong movie style with the Hollywood action adventure. Sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in Hollywood.

" Any one who has seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead. Though it wasn't a success in th box office or TV ratings The Fox Movie Channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually. I liked the way that they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew.Though Sarandon didn't have long hair like any other Jesus would in other films his looks are pretty close to what a Jewish man would appear. What surprised me or startled me was the scene where Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate And don't ever forget that you are a Jew! Though that may have not been a racist remark Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days.Keith Michell's portrayal of Pilate was hulking comparing with his previous performances in The Story of Jacob and Joseph and The Story of David . But if you compare his portrayal of Pilate with Telly Savala's or Hurd Hatfield you can say that he really painted well the impression of a Roman procurator. ",positive
" Having looked at some of the other comments here I have a main complaint with this presentation. The two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful victim and the handsome obviously extremely off-center blue-collar protagonist (if just short of totally-deranged ) - take turns beating the hell out of each other sort of like a Caucasian Kabuki scenario. This is all right and this is of course mainly a turning-the-tables story. However my referenced complaint is that I believe the director got caught-up in his desire to display Farrah's well-known and obvious physical attributes. Beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes these distract from the poignancy level of the drama. Her roommates I'm certain give performances as written and directed - however their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing don't ring true -- based upon Farrah's previous experience with this guy the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred. But this is a film and story compelling as much in spite of as because of the director's work. ",positive
" Like TALK RADIO THE BOOTH is actually kinda predictable (TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened going in THE BOOTH because of- let's face it- the genre and the basic set-up). That's not necessarily a bad thing in this case. It means in essence that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they might've in say an American version of this story. THE BOOTH moves inexorably toward its (foregone) conclusion but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of (very scenic) road. It reminds me of Harlan Ellison's spooky short story FLOP SWEAT. The claustrophobia is at times almost palpable. Worth a nice long look. ",positive
" Once a year comes a movie like that and makes things easy for you. You don't have make an effort to think it is good it's just is. You enjoy it while you watch it and you take it home with you. I can't say it is totally flawless but it's near. Acting - great story -interesting and with elements of suspense. It's a small family story pretty much predictable but it's not the secret itself that matters. it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it. I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I didn't like that much is the actress that played the mother she was too tough and without necessity. Keren ",positive
" While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy is she so convincingly evil here as a witch especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation ! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes Rupert Everett Ricky Gervais Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties there's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances the main difference was that with PB you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe for the most part that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. So on that note I highly recommended Stardust. ",positive
" A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down. However I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it upon its theatrical release I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an F letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event I loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an A . It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme. Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However in light of the above the film is intentionally clichéd implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was self-aware . Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm reading too much into the film it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something more adult . Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said While it was a fine book I didn't think it was the right story for a film . So instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme. Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz as Adam Carr is involved in many of the funniest moments. While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more. ",positive
" I know some people think the movie is boring but I disagree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of Archie's life a mystery captured his humanity. I don't think the purpose of a good biography should be the detailing of someone's life but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what is more fascinating than someone so successfully reinventing themselves? Men become what they dream - you have dreamed well. Good job to Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more films. ",positive
" Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed Phone Booth '02 and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into COMBAT!! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz) Intermission '03 gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton) Blue Crush '02 gave a great supporting role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson) All The Real Girls '03 showed his true acting skills in the role that he played. There was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. Enjoyable and entertaining film to view. ",positive
" AG was an excellent presentation of drama suspense and thriller that is so rare to American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the willies. We rooted for Caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of Sheriff Lucas. We became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what Lucas would do next were truly surprising. This show lived up to the Gothic moniker in ways American entertainment has so seldom attempted much less mastered. The suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show puts shame to the current glut of reality shows- which are so less than satisfying viewing.The call for a DVD box set is well based. This show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. A public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling. Bring on the DVD box set!! ",positive
" Audiard made here a very interesting movie. It begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman in its working universe as a secretary; she is ignored frustrated rejected... Hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life : but the guy is just coming out from jail. Their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively. Characters'description is profund goes into details...both start to help each other; for she can read on lips which reveals itself to be very useful for him...She will progressively evolve far from what she was at first. It's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing even if it turns into a film noir at the end. Gesture is in particular beautifully observed in Audiard's filming. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated at the Best Actess Cesar Awards for her magistral play. Action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple etude de moeurs . It's actually surprisingly entertaining : 8/10. ",positive
" ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting Irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) went around claiming that he could beat any man alive. Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen. Raoul Walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor. All the Warner contract players make up the fine cast--including the always reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's rambunctious father proud of his son's fighting abilities and ALEXIS SMITH who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking Flynn down a peg with saucy one-liners dealing with his conceited manners. All of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious B&W although it's too bad Warners didn't have more faith in Flynn to do the film in color. He was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out. The fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen with Flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. And the scene where Bond turns over his award plaque to Flynn at a social gathering is one of Ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor. Summing up: Maintains interest all the way through whether you're a sports fan or not. ",positive
" Another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the Holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the Rosenstrasse Protest in Berlin an event I had not known of that began in late February 1943. The details are given in an addendum that follows this review. The film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in New York City in the present. Here a well off non-observant Jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual. She goes even further demanding that her daughter's non-Jewish fiancé leave the house. The distressed daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during WWII in Berlin her mother then 8 years old had been taken in and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything goes to Berlin and finds this woman Lena Fischer now 90. Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. It all seems rather too pat. The film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same Mrs. Fischer at 33 (played magnificently by Katja Riemann) a Baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel) a Jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the Rosenstrasse site. The narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in New York City once again. While scenes in the present are color saturated the 1943 scenes are washed out strong on blue-gray tones. The quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta New German Cinema's most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress. The story of the protest is told simply. Only one feature is lacking that would have helped: still-text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at Rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive. Rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics. Overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music: so go the usual raps. It is too long. But I found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on Rosenstrasse where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction. The very absence of extreme violence (no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized) intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed. You keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute. The somberness of the film stayed with me afterward. I awoke often later in the night I saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film. For me that happens rarely. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 05/31/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites. Add: The Rosenstrasse Protest: Swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the Final Roundup in the national capital 1700 to 2000 Jews mostly men married to non-Jewish women were herded into Rosenstrasse 2-4 a welfare office for the Jewish community in central Berlin. Because these Jews had German relatives many of them highly connected Adolf Eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied Poland. Normally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the East. But before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the Rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever-growing numbers. Perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time. Women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week. Unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich. Joseph Goebbels the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nation's public morale. On both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women's actions. Rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the Final Solution Goebbels with Hitler's concurrence released the Rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them who already had been sent to Auschwitz! To both Hitler and Goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable. But they were mistaken. Almost all of those released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction. (Adapted from an article posted at the University of South Florida website A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust. ) ",positive
" I bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering Texas day but was pleasantly surprised. After suffering through Saturday Night Foolishness I had no desire to see a re-make in some south Texas barnyard....and I didn't. John Revolta was good as the jealous redneck Scott Glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex-con and Debra Winger was as always a delight. *Love that woman* Plus the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy that can't stand the sound of country music]. A fun film all the way. ",positive
" I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie. I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films. This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it. Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense. The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963. It was even more scary. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin. ",positive
" I watched the presentation of this on PBS in the U.S. when it originally aired in 1988 (?). Assuming the miniseries was available on DVD I purchased first editions of all three books last year. Since then I have been searching for the series on internet movie sites. Today I found this web site. I will give up the search. I too would like to buy this complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. After buying the DVDs I would read each book then watch the episodes for that book. That is what I did with John LeCarre's Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty's Texas ranger trilogy. Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or book series that became very good TV miniseries - or movie series - that are now available on DVD? ",positive
" This is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple. The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion infidelity juggling work and family. The so called culture of death that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think. A must see. I hope it gets distributed as it should. Congratulations on the cast and director. Two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me! ",positive
" i watched this movie 10 years ago. and have watched it on video an average of once a year since. it's the type of movie that's timeless because the themes are universal yet the stories and conversation are so personal. it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll despite the fact that there are really just two (very involving) characters. this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality TV and now the phenomenon is rampant! i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space and makes you think however jaded you may be that you are one of those characters. it also made me want to ride the train around Europe! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. maybe that speaks about myself my friends or just the sheer genius of this movie.

" Most reviews say that this is the weakest point in Hamilton's short movie career. This movie is a bit different from the rest and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie and what you expect from Hamilton. Knowing Hamilton as a photographer you can be slightly surprised. While Bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian with a plot connecting these scenes Laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them (male-female artist-model) but though we see beautiful photos many of them better than his average their number is reduced for the sake of the plot. Tendres cousines is different from both it is only Hamilton's movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos. Because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than Hamilton's fans looking like an erotic comedy (but not German soft-core type - Schulmädchen report fans would be very disappointed). You won't laugh a lot but you can smile (and that's something you don't often get from Hamilton). Unlike all other Hamilton's movies the age of female varies. Unlike other movies main character is a boy. Unlike his usual works this one isn't put out of place and out of time. We have characters that live their life have their destiny and don't lead us only from one photo to another from one nude girl to another. Unfortunately Hamilton (again) gets lost with a script in his hands. Girls on beaches under shower in low-light rooms in gardens under tents in front of mirrors regardless of the amount of clothes - this is his territory he can shoot minutes and hours and whatever he does you'll always feel the artist's eye and hand behind it. But when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being Hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script. Hamilton is best known for his nudes but they are just a part of his work. And in Tendres cousines we have a reverse situation: his girls are not in the best shots. Nature garden house remind us on Hamilton's work (often neglected part of it) while girls even when nude don't have anything special in the way he presents us. Maybe Hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept maybe he was really trying to make something new (and no one dared to tell him he shouldn't) but he neglected what he was mostly praised for.

" I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen. After the original film we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically but also quite sexually in love. One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality. The skin show in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff leg and hip baring costume she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips. It's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie. ",positive

" Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt) is in line for the throne of England. The present King William (Jim Broadbent) is not well and may not live long. However Vicky's scheming mother The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the regents until she is older since she is only 20 years of age. The young lady refuses despite John slapping her around. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Yet when William does pass away shortly after her 21st birthday Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. First she must surround herself with the right advisers to govern wisely. She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who although an older man is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. Sooner than not the young queen should select her future mate as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom for an heir must appear in the coming years. Meanwhile in Germany some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well. Handsome Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) of the Saxon-Coburg dynasty is prodded by his father to court the young English royal. Once he arrives at the palace he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. But since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making can he succeed in winning her heart? This is a lovely film made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria. Yes she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily. Friend too does well as do the other actors including Broadbent Richardson Bettany Strong (what a repulsive role!) and the rest. Also the movie is gorgeously shot costumed and set making it a visual treat in every way. If anything is lacking it is an extra dose of dazzle as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic at times with a somewhat unimaginative edit. However this is only a minor minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film. In short young and old should make time for Young Victoria. It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings. ",positive
" Sandra the Making of a Woman is a standout among exploitation films and is so for two reasons: (1) an excellent yet effortless performance by Monica Gayle and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of the project. These two talents both of whom are quite underrated make Sandra a film that should be seen. Another key element of the film's success is its realism -- there is nothing fake or Hollywood about this set-in-California film. It is truly a slice of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film the simple dresses worn by the character the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing at her front door and Sandra sits on the couch without make-up while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics looking truly as if she just woke up (but nevertheless beautiful) the harmless weirdo Sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra the one-room apartment into which Sandra moves --all of these elements of the film seem totally real and as such the viewer is drawn into Sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class. This film could have easily failed in less competent hands and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions but the Garver/Gale team see to it that Sandra is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film.

" I was probably one of the few Australians not watching the tennis when this series aired. I have to say when William McInnes first appeared I though that is one crappy actor! But as the series continued he toned down his performance and I totally loved him. He was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers play a nice quiet man and even more interesting to watch Tom Longs' rippling muscles! Sigh... Seriously Long's performance was a total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was good also in a small role and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance. I'd recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching Tom Long walk around with no shirt on... ",positive
" Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn. His comrades are killed instantly but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp; as he turns into a savage killer melting every step of the way he is tracked by his friend Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). This is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional. It seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the '50's and 60's and as such it's a marvelously entertaining movie. That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. We're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything but is still a gas to watch. Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed. I think his pacing is a little off; some scenes (like the one with the elderly couple) go on a little long but ultimately he delivers solid schlocky B-movie goods with a degree of panache. The climax is especially fun. Arlon Obers' music is enjoyably shuddery (yet also amusingly silly during some moments) and Willy Curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots at times. That brings me to Rick Bakers' fantastic and convincing makeup effects which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie right down to the ultimate final melt. Rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie (Sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running) and does what he has to do well enough. DeBenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero and Ann Sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife but Myron Healey Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are fine in support. It's also worth it to see folk like Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith (doing an appreciable topless shot) Janus Blythe (of Tobe Hoopers' Eaten Alive and Wes Cravens' The Hills Have Eyes ) and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit part. This is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore chills and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere. 8/10 ",positive
" Viewing DE VIERDE MAN (aka THE FOURTH MAN) is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience. It's a very tight and intense psychological mystery/thriller from Netherlands's Paul Verhoeven. He directed this film just before he got big with his free-ticket to Hollywood -movie FLESH + BLOOD. In a lot of user-comments on this site I noticed the mentioning of Alfred Hitchcock. Indeed this movie might very well be Hitchcockian but I also noticed touches of early Cronenberg (the visceral) flavors of David Lynch (surreal story-linked visuals) and even Roman Polanski (plot-wise set-up). Funny thing is that the movies by those directors I was thinking of while watching DE VIERDE MAN weren't made until after 1983 the year of release of THE FOURTH MAN. So go figure. Very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by Gerard Reve this movie is based on. Gerard Reve is also the fictional name of the main character (a tormented writer played by Jeroen Krabbé balancing on the dangerous line of a severe psychosis). Now has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word rêve is French for dream ? And the film does feature a lot of dream-like/nightmarish sequences often to that extend that you don't always know for sure if Gerard is awake or dreaming himself. Could this be coincidence...? Maybe it's just me but I don't think so. Renée Soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady (in a rather demanding role). She sometimes seems to be guilty of over-acting (in a subtle way). But that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays since as this movie progresses you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions. Proves again what an excellent actress she is. I might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male & female nudity as well as some rather explicit sex-scenes (and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the blueprints of scenes later to be shot for Verhoeven's BASIC INSTINCT). Another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical references/images which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservative/catholic movements at the time of its European release. Either way it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing. Now someone recently told me he had grave misgivings about DE VIERDE MAN. One of them being that the film supposedly manoeuvers itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of the Virgin Mary to resolve itself. I myself have big issues with the way Catholicism has been and still is sometimes portrayed in many movies in any genre (so not only when it comes to religiously themed horror movies). But surprisingly I had no misgivings whatsoever when it comes to THE FOURTH MAN. Although the Virgin Mary-aspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point I also had fun with it in a way. I think the keyword as to why it didn't bother me at all is 'duality'. Because this movie works on two levels. Although 'divine intervention' might have resolved the plot-line from the protagonist's point of view... on the other hand: the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious ramblings of a raving madman. And that's the fun part: You never know for sure. And then there's the question: Could it be that Gerard Reve was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come... like receiving omens? At one point in the movie Gerard even tries to fool Christine into believing he is clairvoyant. The way he is playing Christine in that particular scene is exquisite to behold. So with its compelling story convincing acting performances and adequate direction DE VIERDE MAN is a very much recommended viewing indeed (especially if you enjoy a solid European psychological horror film). But make sure you see the original Dutch version (not the dubbed one). ",positive
" First off this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to. the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema apparently its the other way around. If one were to look back after the film it really wasn't meant to be convincing it was a low budget ipecac. But really thats all it was aiming for it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value (and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original VHS versions). I gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific (in non-shock sense) it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid/pessimistic(i didn't trust anyone for about a week because i didn't want to wake up strung up and tortured) ",positive
" I'll keep this one quite short. I believe that this is an extraordinary movie. I see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that it's not real in its portrayal of life. OK so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed. Hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives. Gangland violence is real right? Is it right no! This movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated. I have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving (well not until 2008 anyway). 9 out of 10 from me for this one. It's very nearly perfect in my view. JMV ",positive
" I have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many IMDb users (Some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever.' What?? Haven't any of you seen Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on. Duh! What the crap were you expecting from a Jet Li movie? Did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action? Of course not! Black Mask is awesome wall-to-wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time. It's also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs decapitations and creative ways of watching the bad guys (and quite a few innocent people too!) get slaughtered. Most of Li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to Black Mask; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever! And that made me a happy camper. Again: if you go into a Jet Li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot you are going for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his movies (though beware of the horrendous dubbing). ",positive
" There are some films that every Horror fan owes himself (or herself) to see and Emilio Miraglia's La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte aka. The Red Queen Kills Seven Times (1972) is definitely one of them. With Gialli and Gothic Tales being my two favorite sub-genres in Horror I was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and even though my expectations were high this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes. Miraglia's earlier Giallo The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave (1971) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed Giallo with Gothic Horror but it couldn't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite. The Red Queen Kills Seven Times is hands down one of the most unique and overwhelming Italian Horror films ever made and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it. An incredibly mesmerizing Giallo with strong Gothic elements The Red Queen delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre: An inventive and incredibly compelling plot spine-chilling suspense a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere eerily lush colors stylish murders a brilliant score and not least a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful Barbara Bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror. The film starts out incredibly in a beautiful Gothic castle in Germany. As little girls Kitty Wildenbrück and her sister Evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting: Legend has it that a fiendish Red Lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people. Fourteen years later Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) has become a successful fashion photographer. Suddenly people begin to get murdered... Director Miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style atmosphere and colorful creepiness with The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem. The Red Queen Kills Seven Times is a feast for the eyes indeed and one of the most overwhelming Italian Horror films both visually and plot-wise. The haunting painting in the Grandfather's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps. The Red Lady (or Red Queen as she is called in the English title) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a Giallo the spine-chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own. A sexy female cast is always appreciated especially in a Giallo and this one is a prime example for that. The ravishing Barbara Bouchet (one of my favorite actresses) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen and she is a great actress too. Bouchet's presence has graded up many Italian flicks among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest Cult-masterpieces of Italian 70s cinema within one year (1972): Fernando Di Leo's Milano Calibro 9 Lucio Fulci's Giallo-highlight Don't Torture a Duckling and this unforgettable gem. Apart from the wonderful Miss Bouchet the film's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young Sybil Danning Marina Malfatti ( The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave ) and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera. As the whole film the murders are stylish and extremely elegant yet frightening and macabre and some of them are quite gory. Bruno Nicolai's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets and makes the film's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting. The plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings the tension-level increses with each passing minute. The Red Queen... begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second. Overall this is one of the films that I cannot find enough words of praise for. The Red Queen Kills Seven Times is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest Gialli ever made and a top-priority for every fan of Horror and/or Italian cinema to see. 10/10 ",positive
" People tend to complain about the number of films being made about mentally disabled people. I don't see this as a valid criticism no more than complaints of too many films about any sort of people. Jaco van Dormael does a wonderful job with the script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together with Duquenne basically playing himself. The film covers a surprisingly large ground of events and isn't simply content to go over what was seen in Rain Man . The ending is rather depressing but it doesn't ruin the wonderful story that has come before. 7.8 out of 10 ",positive
" As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE director John Boorman delivers an effective film about Man's violent side in DELIVERANCE arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds Jon Voight Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before it is dammed up into what Reynolds calls one big dead lake. But the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these city boys carousing through their woods. And the following day continuing on down the river Beatty and Voight are accosted and sexually assaulted (the film's infamous SQUEAL! sequence) by two vicious mountain men (Bill McKinney Herbert Cowboy Coward). Thus what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism. James Dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker. Often known for its SQUEAL! and Dueling Banjos sequences DELIVERANCE is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal with the four leading men superb in their roles and McKinney and Coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times. A must-see film for those willing to take a chance. ",positive
" Darius Goes West is a film depicting American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected but longed to see what was outside the confines of his lovely city of Athens GA. Darius wished to see the ocean. His longtime friends Logan Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius' wish come true. They started small - Ben & Logan's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to Darius' condition: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take Darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great United States. To say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They realized Darius' dream and then some. They put their lives on hold while showing love care and tons of fun to Darius while helping Darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from DMD. Darius went on to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his buddies) outside a local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one else deserves it more. Martha Sweeney. ",positive
" Pinjar by Mr dwivedi is an awesome movie. Its definitely the greaest and finest of 2003. There are very good performances in it. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila. she is like u have never seen before. one true great performance. along with her is a fine actor Manoj bajpai who has shown bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The movie is about a girl(Urmila) living in Pre-partition pakistan. she is from a punjabi family livin in a small town. she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going-on-for-years kinda fight with the punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns as urmila's arranged marriage is due in few days. this movie is truly a very good movie. the storyline is solid with an amazing screenplay. all the performances like lillete dubey isha koppikar (u wont believ but she can act as well besides jus dancin on Khallas) kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. those sets with pre-partition pakistan costumes cinematography sound background score add to the positive points. from the start till the end u r stuck to u'r seat with the question whats next? this movie is not jus worth watchin but deserved to be a part of your movie collection. the ultimate scene is the end of the movie. i would suggest all those No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai crowd to watch this amazing flick. my rating: 10/10.

" I've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. Mystery Men takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like Batman and Captain Nice and cartoons like Underdog and Super Chicken. The same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek tone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. It's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here. Mystery Men opens on a party at a nursing home. I wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. As it is it looks like something George Romero might have devised. We need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else or it feels patronizing. By the time the Red Eyes crash the festivities you half expect Tom Waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: Just what this party needs--a little excitement! If writer Neil Cuthbert had any sense he would have had Waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same. It would have made for a rousing beginning and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the Shoveler (William Macy); the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day. There are many other problems to Mystery Men than I care to go into; among them that the villain Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie and he doesn't. Geoffrey Rush is the wrong actor for the part; he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. And Rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. You hope for the ripe theatrics of a John Lithgow in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai or the dry debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized. There are too many ideas running through Mystery Men for anyone to tie them neatly together and that may be its deepest problem. But whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love. Ben Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes. This one is no exception but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His Roy is related to all the put-upon overly sensitive chronically defensive types that Woody Allen made popular. And whether it's wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout (the sleek Claire Forslani) or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx) or giving a new member of their elite group (Jeaneane Garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time he makes it always fun to watch. I couldn't exactly say that about him in There's Something About Mary. Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of One True Thing not Renee Zellweger. I don't think I have ever seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling ball so sue me) in the movies. And the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in Breaking the Waves. And in this version the girl doesn't die and bells don't ring in your head. William H. Macy does something very difficult; he makes stolid magnetic. You understand right away what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie. You can also understand her exasperation. The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge but when Eddie's adorable half-breed son looks up at his father and says I believe in you Daddy. to which Lucille sighs and exclaims Roland don't encourage your father you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in The Birdcage ) and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in Bananas and Mary Hartman Mary Hartman? ) as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as his publicist; Kel Mitchell as Invisible Boy ; Paul Reubens as The Spleen; and Lena Olin who if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has would seem to be visiting the set.

" Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. While we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising. Spall's range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the Mike Leigh repertory. While an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on The Simpsons this central situation of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in Rhidian Brook's script is well-contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into acts. We're introduced to the urban British range of racially and religiously diverse kids (with their uniforms I couldn't tell if this is a private or public school) as they gather  the rapping black kids the serious South Asians and Muslims the white bullies and mean girls  but conveyed quite naturally and individually. The young actors some of whom I recognized from British TV such as Shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures. Celia Imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor's role than the martinets she usually has to play. A break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious. We think like the teacher portrayed by Ben Miles of Coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but it's much more about faith in people as well as God which is why the BBC showed it in England at Easter time and BBC America showed it in the U.S. over Christmas. Nathalie Press who was also so good in Summer of Love has a key role in Mr. Harvey's redemption that could have been played for movie-of-the-week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way (unfortunately I saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials). While it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than I've seen in most holiday-themed TV movies.

" this is my first review on IMDb i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now i feel compelled to add my perspective...and no i'm not associated to the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you here that before ;-) ) FYI i'm in my late 20s 1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style. The characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie after all it's a fairytale-like world. But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. The blue bunny-like mini-dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie he is already an instant classic much as Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT good ;-) 1 thing i have to point out imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway i had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it. 8 5 for me ",positive
" I got to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and I mean uber cute. It had all the sex content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene . Both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other's roles perfectly and even Wanda Sykes' rather small role will keep you laughing. Though these kind of comedies aren't for everybody but I have to say I went with a person that doesn't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy. This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are little too...well lets say ADULT for younger viewers. All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending I found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2* out of 5*) ",positive
" I thought this was a very good movie. It would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off. I'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending that's why this made this move such a good movie. It shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it's 2 sisters dealing with a boy (the same boy) that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them. It's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I still do now when it comes on. I seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on. It would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died this way it would keep him alive even though he's dead.

" I remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. I knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day! We rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. Wasn't necessary. The only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name the fact that there is a bet and a whole lot of worm eating. Oh yeah I almost forgot the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent. How the kids know each other the number of kids involved how the bet came about the number of worms that must be eaten the time frame in which he has to eat the worms how they are cooked progression of friendships climax scenes etc. NOTHING is the same. But somehow it did not ruin the movie for me. The characters are all enjoyable and the film did not leave me disappointed. Word of caution for parents there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when Billy's little brother referred to his penis as a dilly dick . The embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us Does anybody know what a dilly dick is? lol. That and an occasional shut up is as foul mouthed as this film gets. My daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 (and was holding the empty nacho container just in case) but was fine by worm 6. She and I both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience. ",positive
" This is one of the creepiest scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie EVER! Dr Creed (Louise) and his family moving in to new home with his wife (Rachel) Daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage) Everything seems normal until Dr Creed loses one his patient who had a terrible head injury Then he is haunted by the ghost know as Victor takes him to the Pet Sematarty and show him that where the dead come to life. Louis not knowing if that was all dream and is talking to Ellie who worried about her cat that could be killed by lorry and then later on Rachel tells Louis that it really hard for to talk about death because of her sister Zelda who was really sick (As we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most creepiest scene ever!) The next day Louis gets a call from Jed saying there cat as been killed by lorry and Jed take him to place where Victor the Ghost told him not to go! And bury the Cat His wife and kids have go to see their Grandparents and Louise is home alone shocked to see the cat is back and now it as evil in it eyes so he goes to see Jed then Jed tell him that he also buried his dog there too (As we seen other flashback). Later on in the movie The Family out having Picnic Gage is playing with kite and Gage say's I drop it The wind blow the rod near the road where a lorry coming at fast past Gage is get closer to road Louis is rushing to get him The most HEARTBREAKING scene in any horror movie will leave with your Jaw on floor or Shivers will go down your back when you hear Louis screams Soon he missing him so much Louis then buries Gage in same place where is buried the Cat. The scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from really life. This movie is just Amazing and the acting from everyone was great! 10 out 10 ",positive
" I found about the movie Holes by hearing from people that it wasn't typical Disney that both kids and adults both got into the story. Folks let me tell you I wasn't disappointed. Holes is based on the novel by Louis Sachar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert. He befriends a boy nicknamed Zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting unique different and funny story. I didn't know quite what to expect when I watched it. It was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and Jon Voight was just hilarious as Mr. Sir. Now that I've seen the movie I have to read the book. Most recommended! ",positive
" This is a great movie that I don't think gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even though it was made in 1980 it is still timely today. The great country music soundtrack is terrific. 10/10 ",positive

" Now days most people don't watch classic movies such as this. Most of friends only watch movies from the '90s to present. Thats kinda stingy. Most old movies like this are masterpieces unique in their own way. Only because back when these movies were being thought of and made thats when ideas were fresh. Now people strain just to think of new ideas. Anyway to the movie. For true fans of classic horror. This is for you. The movie is based with a investigator from Scotland Yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house. I won't say anymore for I will ruin the movie more than I already have. But it is a terrific movie for as old as it is. And would never mind watching it again! ",positive
" Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world (some 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation--a tall order that the team at Priority Films does with great success. American actor Ron Livington stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in Cambodia. Although it tackles a heavy topic the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch. I am glad a film like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's GREAT and a film EVERYONE must see.

" In reflecting on this movie I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. One relatively forgettable but covering the same geography is Coup de Torchon the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of Indochine the complex and unspoken relationship between France and her colonial subjects. I was struck with the dignity of Potee with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also struck with the love/hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its driving force it is the latter that links this movie to Indochine. One never is sure what motivates everyone though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that ties it to Coup de Torchon. Theirs is the more scandalous story perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way but Denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships. The American black who gives the grown up France a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the Western world have when we look at Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother. He was coming home but they just thought him to be a little daft. France the character and the girl grew up in Cameroon but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was. ",positive
" I just recently watched this 1954 movie starring Vincent Price for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. Price portrays Don Gallico a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife portrayed in a brief role by the lovely Eva Gabor). Even though Price is a murderer I actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him. Although this movie doesn't have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite House of Wax ) it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest. This is a must for Vincent Price fans. ",positive
" Never heard of this movie saw it on DVD.Great movie perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work.No overhyped typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors.No current Quote A list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie.Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences.It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight.As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service.They were regular people too some just weren't cut out for military life I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch.I highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in Afganistan.Basic training is a trip notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need sensitivity training HA!HA!HA!

" An interesting TV movie based on true fact betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for his brother's death penalty. But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias Koteas the problem starts. It has nothing to do with Koteas' acting ability. He just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to G.Q. magazine with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me after meeting again an old friend whom I had not seen for almost 15 years which he spent in several Panamanian jails. The young man I used to know is gone not only because he is older but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the penal system. There are jails and there are jails one must say but this one prisoner in Shot In the Heart is definitely out of this world. ",positive
" This movie was featured on a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 but when I see this film I don't think about that wonderful TV series. I believe this was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie. I actually enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides an old hag and her two bizarre sons one a giant idiot the other a comical dwarf(Angelo Rossitto from 1932's Freaks). I also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter who is kind of a stereotype but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent film is it's plot even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. I don't want to spoil any of this film so go out and rent it or better yet buy it for a couple of bucks. ",positive
" Red Rock West is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore. It's well paced well acted and doesn't leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre. Nicolas Cage stars as Michael an unemployed Texas roughneck desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest to a fault but always on the dark side of fate. After failing to obtain gainful employment Michael stumbles into the Red Rock bar where the owner Wayne (J.T.Walsh) mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from Dallas hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous Suzie. With no intent on following through Michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn Suzanne of her impending demise. He also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits. As fate would dictate Michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy. While leaving in a violent rainstorm he runs down Suzannes lover. Of course Michael being Michael he takes him to the local hospital where it's discovered that he's also been shot. The sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it Wayne is also the local law. Michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real Lyle from Dallas played with murderous glee by the quirky Dennis Hopper. After discovering that they're fellow marines Lyle insists that Michael join him for a drink at where else the Red Rock bar. There Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle are in hot pursuit of Michael who falls willingly into Suzannes waiting arms. As the pace picks up we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really wanted armed robbers on the lam for a multi million dollar theft. Getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals double crosses and murders. The film was very well cast. Nicolas Cage was typically low key Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability. The best performance was by the late J.T. Walsh who was menacing without appearing to be. Walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon. Marc Reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development. The film was further enhanced by John Dahl's tight directorial style and Morris Chestnut's rapid fire editing. ",positive
" A weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening! Yes don't be fooled by 2point4 children's cheerful tune and bubbly characters; the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling. And that's what's so good about the show it's not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a 2D comic device (the case with My Family). Instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full roller-coaster of human emotions. The occasionally dark moments such as Bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and Ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth. Of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile. It's a real shame Eureka Video have stopped releasing this comical gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope to get hold of episodes unavliable in the shops. ",positive
" Very Slight Spoiler This movie (despite being only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I didn`t really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents so I can`t really comment on that. The acting in this was so good I had to pinch myself and say Remember it`s only a movie this DIDN`T REALLY HAPPEN . As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talk I knew that it was exactly what John and Paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting. The offhanded comments and burns from John were right on with his character(especially in the restaurant!) as was his depression while Paul was very easy going and laid back. Both actors did and excellent job and I was thrilled to have seen this movie. It`s a wicked experience for any Beatles fan. And prepare for a few surprises! ",positive
" The first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you're on it in the first place; then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with. Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in `Girlfight ' written and directed by Karyn Kusama. Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is an eighteen-year-old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester. She affects a `whatever' attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go. She lives with her father Sandro (Paul Calderon) with whom she has a very tentative relationship and her younger brother Tiny (Ray Santiago). With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her. And one day she finds it without even looking for it when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains. Ironically Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing; he wants to go to art school but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons. When Diana convinces Tiny's trainer Hector (Jaime Tirelli) to take her on and approaches her father for the money under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance (she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for) Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money. Ultimately with Tiny's help she finds a way and the ring soon becomes her second home. It's an environment to which she readily adapts and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better. And the fact that she will have to fight men not women in `gender blind' competitions does not faze her in the least. Diana has found her element. First time writer/director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere. And there's no candy coating on it either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is `I was a fighter once. I lost.' Then looking around the busy gym `Like most of these guys they're going to lose too. But it's all they know--' And it's that honesty of attitude as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed that makes this movie as good as it is. It's a bleak world underscored by the dimly lit run-down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have all that they know. Making her screen debut Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves. She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin? Whatever it is it works. It's a powerful memorable performance by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation. She certainly makes Diana a positive role model one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life at least to those who would seek them out. As positive as this film is however it ends on something of an ambiguous note; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground there's no indication of where she's headed. Is this a short term fix for her or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector? After all realistically (and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film) professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to nor opens it's arms to women. And in keeping with the subject matter of the film and the approach of the filmmaker an affirmation of the results of Diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate. The supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian) Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol) Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira). Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify there are certain aspects of `Girlfight ' that stretch credibility a bit regarding some of what happens in the ring. That aside it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience. I rate this one 7/10. ",positive
" This movie is probably for you. It had an overall meditative quality from the music to the beautiful photography and listening to the often cliché things about life that Andy Goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots. If you're familiar with Buddhism- that is the sort of the sense I got out of this film. The impermanence of life the beauty of nature the interconnectedness of all things etc. However what I did not understand confused and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing (I saw over an hour of it) was the redundancy of the whole thing. You only find out bits and pieces of why he's commissioned and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work. The art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends. ",positive
" Jimmy Cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage-producer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming talking movies. This story of love deceit women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done. The story never really got lost in this frantic pace. Some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn't matter because when you look at this in a 1933 time-frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time. Jimmy Cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film never loosing his composure as the ever-working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros. In this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business he was a broadway producer before he started this. Joan Blondell is fabulous as the neglected love-interest Nan she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change. The only problem I had with the film were the enormous productions at the end. These were magnificent in itself beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced but they just didn't seem to fit in the story. The only link they have to the main story is that Cagney had to put on 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater. In this way the Sitting On A Backyard Fence was much more appropriate to the story. The productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first Musical sequence and then I realized there were another two coming up. These sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well. All in all a great film with a sour ending. 9/10 ",positive
" Do not expect a depiction of the truth . However the accounts of these veterans of the Iraqi & Afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration. The major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post-war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives. My major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military's and Veterans Affairs' programs for helping those who've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war. These are NOT fatal flaws of the film. As a veteran myself I know that the horrible aftermath of war is real and these young men and women articulate it very well. These vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing.

" Remarkable disturbing film about the true-life senseless brutal murder of a small-town family along with the aftermath and examination of the lives of the killers Dick Hickok and Perry Smith. No matter how much time goes by or how dated this film may look it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this. This really traces multiple tragedies: The tragedy brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family a decent farm family in small-town Holcomb Kansas; and the wasted brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smith. An interesting point is made in the film: that neither of these two immature scared petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone. But together they created a dangerous murderous collective personality; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them. They push each other along a road of proving something to each other. That they were man enough to do it to carry it out; neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big score ; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led. These were two grown-up children who live in a criminal's world of not backing down from dares; who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness. in this instance these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters. The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the Clutter family but the point is made. These were respected law-abiding small-town people who didn't deserve this terrifying fate. The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith. Perry Smith whose early life was filled with security and love but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path. Hickok poor and left pretty much to his own devices not able to see how he fit in using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with. An interesting and maybe the first look at capital punishment and what ends we hope to achieve. Is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these? Is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit operating under the radar believing they fool everyone they come into contact with? To be deterred you must believe it's possible you will be caught. Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught?; who have committed hundreds of petty crimes and got away with them? This was supposed to be a cinch no witnesses . When caught Hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks. Smith who believes he deserves such a fate anyway who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has cowardly caved in. Hickok blinked first. A silly game of chicken between two immature emotionally damaged dangerous men. Fascinating psychological thriller telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation's history. Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles made their careers. ",positive
" I picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics' quotes on the back of the box. I'm not big into foreign films and didn't know what to expect. I don't really care for subtitles either. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life. I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly. I'd recommend this picture to anyone even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles. This one makes it worth the effort. ",positive
" Unfortunately this film has long been unavailable (as other posters have noted) but this is one of the essential dramas of the Great Depression a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a shanty-town. It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young that are just about the finest of their careers and it's a surpassing example of how the director Frank Borzage was able to create an almost fairy-tale aura around elements of poverty crime and horrendous social inequity which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were. This film shows how love survives amidst squalor and desperate need and it is totally life-affirming. This is a real masterpiece of the period and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known.

" Night of the Living Homeless was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11. Obviously a parody of various zombie movies most notably Dawn of the Dead this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains. Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming I don't have any change!! Unfortunately the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them asking everyone for change. The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately homeless people break into the man's house and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder screaming horribly until he finally dies. This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in Fantastic Easter Special two weeks ago. Meanwhile a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem the property values have nosedived thus the bank has foreclosed on his house making him homeless. Randy immediately turns on him holding the gun to the man's head. When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out Randy pulls the trigger. In Evergreen the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica California. The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10 ",positive
" The lovely Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding her. Richter plays Anna an out-of-work independent-minded somewhat neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair-bound muted aged father named Walentin (the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth who died at 77 shortly after this film was made). SPOILER ALERT Walentin refuses to respond to anyone --until he confronts the gifted Anna whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a self-imposed death sentence. Writer/director/actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son (Jorgen played by Clausen) has loving a father who has never accepted him. The film sags toward the end but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia the nature and value of loving and caring and how one person the irrepressible Anna can alter the course of a human life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance is alone worth the price of admission. ",positive
" Playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers  not to mention the numerous other actors who've besieged the castle before. Fortunately for the fantasists this version  with the nicely cast Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton  stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it. It's the right length to do the story full justice and makes considerable use of Bronte's cracking dialogue; none of that modern meddling away cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes. The magic of the original story lies in the tensions created between the central characters and the lives circumstances create for them to lead. Jane  poor plain and little  grows up on the stinting charity of a cold aunt her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school. She arrives as a governess in the household of Mr Rochester utterly friendless and alone. She represses herself habitually out of duty and hard experience but her passionate nature soon finds its touch-paper in her stern keenly intelligent enigmatic master to whom she is drawn as he is to her by forces beyond their control. Rochester is the caged tiger busy paving hell with energy ; potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him  but pervious through a chink or two . His character is extraordinary: he takes extraordinary liberties with a paid subordinate; but then Jane is no ordinary employee as he sees. But a dark secret and severe trials lie before them both. It's a pleasure to hear Bronte's remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors  Dalton in particular seems formed for passion on a Brontean scale. If you've only ever seen him as a not-so-memorable Bond you've missed the thing he's best at. Those who've commented that his Rochester is too handsome miss the point of these dramatisations: his character has simply too much screen time for a really ugly man to retain the viewer's attention. Timothy Dalton is just right not always or consistently handsome but often glancingly strikingly so just as it should be. And Zelah Clarke's Jane is no wallflower; she conveys the emotions of a woman who habitually represses her sense of humour and her passionate nature very successfully allowing her rare outbursts to show to more dramatic effect. Not so long ago the BBC aired an excellent dramatisation of Jean Rhys' enlightened and most unsettling riposte to Bronte Wide Sargasso Sea imagining the back-story of the first Mrs Rochester. Do check it out  you'll never see the 'hero' of Jane Eyre in quite the same way again. ",positive
" This police procedural is no worse than many others of its era and better than quite a few. Obviously it is following in the steps of Dragnet and Naked City but emerges as an enjoyable programmer. The best thing about it is the unadorned look it provides into a world now long gone...the lower class New York of the late 40's/early 50's. Here it is in all its seedy glory from the old-school tattoo parlors to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons. These old police films are like travelogues to a bygone era and very bittersweet to anybody who dislikes the sanitized soulless cityscape of today. Also intriguing is the emphasis on the nuts-and-bolts scientific aspect of solving the crime...in this case the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes Detectives Tobin and Corrigan do the footwork but without the tedious and painstaking efforts of the lab boys they'd get nowhere. Although the technology is not in the same league the cops here use the dogged persistence of a C.S.I. investigator to track down their man. The way some reviewers have written about this movie you think it would have been directed by Ed Wood and acted by extras from his movies. What bosh! I enjoyed John Miles as the gangly ex-Marine turned cop Tobin...he had a happy-go-lucky easy-going approach to the role that's a welcome change from the usual stone-faced histrionics of most movie cops of the period. Patricia Barry is cute and delightful as his perky girlfriend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is stuffy and droll as the older detective Corrigan. I rather liked the chemistry of these two and it made for something a bit different than the sort of robotic Dragnet approach. The mystery itself is not too deep and the final chase and shoot-out certainly won't rank amongst the classics of crime cinema but during it's brief running time The Tattooed Stranger more than held my interest.

" Writer/director Henry Brommel has done a wonderful job with his film Panic from the year 2000 and that includes his choice of cast: William H. Macy Tracy Ullman John Ritter Neve Campbell Donald Sutherland Barbara Bain David Dorfman. Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in decidedly un-funny roles and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see. Panic is the story of a hit man Alex (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his true profession by doing mail order work; by all appearances he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Unhappy with his life Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (Ritter) telling only his mother (Bain). In the waiting room he meets a young woman (Campbell) to whom he is immediately attracted which complicates his situation further. His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist. This is a profound story of a gentle good man made into a killer by a monster of a father with his mother's knowledge who kills to please his father but also can't stand up to him and quit. His rage is so deep-seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and it's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression. When it's time for Panic to moves it does - quickly. Panic doesn't seem panicked at all. In fact it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly not because it's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate mirroring Alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog. By making a decision about Sara the Campbell character and by seeing his mark his own psychiatrist as a living breathing human being Alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is -and how they don't jive. And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche Sammy's. William Macy gives another brilliant performance as a loving father a distant husband and a cold killer the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated. This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. It's too adult too small too subtle too character-driven and too good. ",positive

Holes is one of the best movies in 2003. ",positive
" Hollywood North is an euphemism from the movie industry as they went to Canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto in this case later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian the director probably saw a lot of the invaders from California that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the economics that Canada presented. Needless to say Moon Lantern the successful novel written by a Canadian author is turned into Flight to Bogota which has nothing to do with the original film. A great egotistical has-been Michael Baytes who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran is offered the lead part which turns to be a disaster. The film seems to be saying that too many cooks have spoiled the broth which seems to be the case with the ultimate product which is saved by its producer Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan who has been around making a documentary of the film being shot in Toronto parts of the film are transformed into a cohesive movie at last. The filming process is hilarious and the acting in general is good. ",positive
" This tragicomedy written by famous Serbian theatre/film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category. And yet its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A masterpiece one should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles and not dubbed). In an aged bus en route to capital Belgrade a looming war decides the passengers' behaviour. Two Gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie (real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as farmer who's plowed the road give a real-life performance). The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war an insight into nation's collective person: everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy. Using a simple movie language director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war (World War I) but also highlights personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer inexperience of the newlyweds seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy. Brilliant in its narration with memorable soundtrack (especialy the Gispsy songs) and adjusted atmosphere well photographed and edited this feature (Sijan's feature debut) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: Maratonci trce pocasni krug Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota and my other director's favourite Davitelj protiv davitelja ).

" I had the TV on for a white noise companion and heard $400 for a fully furnished apartment So I ran into the TV room expecting another 70's flick and got much more. Luckily I could rewind to the beginning (DVR buffer) and hit the record button to watch it entirely.(Cinemax uncut and in HD no less!) Aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog/events this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. Pretty creepy and progressive at times: Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker played adroitly by Cristina Raines Parker stabs in very gory fashion her father an explicit menage a trios scene.( don't let the kids watch) The film is TOTALLY 70's full of bad clothes(polyester suits and tacky ascots) and decor bad hair over bloated music score and familiar looking cinematography. The cast is excellent take a second on this film's home page to check it out.It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles- always wonderfully creepy! ENJOY! ",positive
" The release of TARZAN THE APE MAN in 1932 caused a sensation. It may be hard to believe 70 years later but the film had much of the same kind of impact as THE MATRIX or THE LORD OF THE RINGS has achieved at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment. Tarzan became an instant pop icon the 'noble savage' that every woman fantasized about and every man wished he could be. The only person unhappy about the situation was Edgar Rice Burroughs who while he'd agreed to MGM's creative liberties and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks felt the 'dumbed down' version of his character (with no plans to allow him to 'grow') was unfaithful to his vision (he would start a production company and soon be making his own 'Tarzan' films). MGM realizing the value of it's newest 'star' knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original...and TARZAN AND HIS MATE delivered! The film had an interesting back story; Cedric Gibbons MGM's legendary Art Director had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel prior to the release of TARZAN THE APE MAN despite the fact that he'd NEVER directed before (the studio hadn't anticipated the film's impact and didn't think a novice director would matter much on a 'novelty' film...and they wanted to keep their Oscar-winning department chief happy). Gibbons a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist loved the freedom of pre-Code Hollywood and decided to have TARZAN AND HIS MATE 'push the envelope' to the limit...Tarzan and Jane would frolic in a nude swim and Jane would appear TOPLESS through most of the film. Maureen O'Sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death in 1998 that while a double was used for the swim she trusted the studio and did 'a couple of days' of filming sans top...but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples and the idea was abandoned (the film shot those days would be worth a fortune!) She did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her 'swim' and donned a revised 'jungle' costume that was extremely provocative very thin and open at the sides...and the resulting outcry would help 'create' the Hays Office and the self-censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry. MGM yanked Gibbons from the production (the 'official' reason given was his workload as Art Director) and veteran Jack Conway was listed as the new director to appease the critics...although James C. McKay actually directed the film as Conway was busy on 3 other projects including VIVA VILLA! The film incorporated the best elements of the original (safaris murderous tribes Tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save Jane) and actually improved on the storytelling. Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) from the first film returns to Africa for ivory from the 'Elephants' Graveyard' and to try to seduce Jane into returning to England with gifts of silk dresses underwear and perfume. He brings with him Martin Arlington (Paul Cavanagh) a crack shot and inveterate womanizer who sneers at Holt's chivalrous pursuit of Jane and stalks her as a potential 'conquest' to be had by any means (including killing Tarzan if and when he can get away with it without being seen). Tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with Jane and puts his foot down refusing to allow the hunters into the Graveyard. Arlington finds his opportunity catching the Ape Man alone and shoots him then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise. Now Jane has no reason to remain in the jungle and she can direct them to the Graveyard before her long voyage back to England comforted by the oh-so-sympathetic Arlington. But a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group...can Tarzan being nursed back to health by his ape 'family' recover in time to save Jane? While stock footage is again used extensively the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits TARZAN AND HIS MATE achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other 'Tarzan' film as well as a sexiness that even Bo Derek's blatantly erotic TARZAN THE APE MAN couldn't touch. Johnny Weissmuller was in peak condition physically Maureen O'Sullivan was never more beautiful and 'Africa' never looked more romantic and dangerous. TARZAN AND HIS MATE was a triumph (although it would be drastically edited for many years) and remains THE classic of the series to this day! ",positive
" First of all this was not a three hour movie - Two hours ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! Perhaps though it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? Yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion. Overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of Lucy and Desi. I watch I Love Lucy from time to time and love it but never have I read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen. Because of this movie I do now but I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Everything here no one really needed to know. This was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. But it was made and the reason is because Lucy & Desi are still such huge stars and certain people in American society feel that the rest of society needs to know ALL about our tv and movie stars. That is definitely so not true and very very sad. Anyway what was shown here in Lucy was pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played Viv Vance - not great casting at all. And the switch from Madeline Zima to Rachel York.... uhhh like Lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? That wasn't too great. But the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between Lucy & Desi. No the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like I said this focused mainly just on Lucy & Desi. Had there been more time had the story been more about Lucy's entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more. But they weren't so we got to see the likes of Gable & Lombard Red Skelton and Buster Keaton very briefly instead. Wow that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in Lucy's life. Really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. Oh well. What was explored was done well for the most part. Honestly I don't think I'll ever watch this again and I don't think this movie'll be that memorable. For someone who digs I Love Lucy but isn't an enormous Lucille Ball fan this should be an interesting watch. My grade for this: B ",positive
" Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS Agent who practically gives the store away to everyone's surprise. What kind of IRS Agent is this? Most of us have all heard the line by an IRS Agent Hello I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help. Our smile then spreads into a chuckle that says Yeah right. As you get further and further into this story you cannot figure this guy out. He goes easy on those who are being audited. What is his motive? Is he from another planet an angel a rich guy who wants to do good? He helps so much we want him to be our auditor should we get audited of course. Hey IRS are you listening? (kidding just kidding) The pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on. Intense repeat intense focus was on Ben and stays there. The whole movie only works because of Ben as we try to figure him out and I didn't see any clues (what clues you talking about Willis?). Not reading the box before watching the DVD movie was the better way to go here. By the end of the movie I finally put it all together. Well it was obvious by then. And yes it's over the top but still a great story mostly because of Will Smith. Will Smith should have been nominated for a Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast were very good as well. Yes it's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong. What's the message? Believe me you will won't need too many clues to figure it out. I didn't. Violence: No. Sex: Yes but nothing to get excited about. Bland. Nudity: No. Language: No. ",positive

" Despite its low-key release in this country and its apparent disregard in other countries (the 'R' rating in the States can't have helped - honestly just because HBC uses the C-word!) this is actually a fine piece of work. The sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it but it's overcome by the playing of the two leads. It's easy to win plaudits just because you're playing a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis Geoffrey Rush Dustin Hoffman etc.) and Helena Bonham-Carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of MND but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely. In fact almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes (and what eyes!). This is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her English Rose reputation and emerging as a figure of some stature. Awards must surely follow though not alas for this fine performance. Branagh one feels has never quite given his best on film (except possibly 'Hamlet' and there his playing was diluted by the large cast). Here though he tops his other appearances playing to the hilt a self-loathing unstable ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasn't always displayed and exhibiting both intelligence and depth. In short we believe him just as much as we could NOT believe him as Frankenstein as the priest in 'The Proposition' as the lawyer in 'The Gingerbread Man' even as Andrew in 'Peter's Friends'. This is surely his finest performance yet - so why could he not produce the goods much earlier? As a film it looks more like a television offering and without its stars it probably wouldn't amount to very much. But it's been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this and I eagerly await more from them (though not 'Love's Labour's Lost'...). 8 out of 10 but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.

So just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it. ",positive
" A mess of genres but it's mainly based on Stephen Chow's genre mash-ups for it's inspiration. There's magic kung-fu college romance sports gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping. The production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it's easy to get past the many flaws in this film. A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery that's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can't read. The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks. The new master gets mad at the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master's weak punches and throws him out for the night. The boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster's club to play darts. This leads to a big fight the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. Al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes. Aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie. The man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over. The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end. The effects photography and stunt work are all top- notch and make up for the uninspired plot. Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite entertaining even with a scatter-shot ending. Recommended. ",positive
" Sort of like a very primitive episode of General Hospital set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that) this fast-moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden as the distraught young husband in the main plot is so palpably a wreck and with such good reason. His expectant wife Loretta Young is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him; Ms. Young as always doesn't do anything to disinvite audience sympathy and she's a little too good to be true though sympathetic and lovely to look at of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie and the outcome -- not an entirely happy one -- feels right. Aline MacMahon one of the cinema's few perfect actresses in the apt words of film historian David Thomson exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse and Glenda Farrell as a none-too-willing new mom of twins gets to croon Frankie and Johnny as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot and he gets to show more range than Warners usually permitted him. It's scaled and paced modestly and Linden's expectant-dad panic stays with you for days -- this sort of part was often played for laughs but he's a terrified young kid in trouble and very persuasive.

" I watched this movie alongwith my complete family of Nine. Since my younger brother has recently got married we could connect with the goings-on. The movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple. Thankfully this time all Indian locales like Ranikhet Almora etc have been used which have been already visited by most of the urbanites hence adding to the connection with movie. The dialogues are much better than those in the Umrao Jaan Ada - a supposedly dialogue based movie. The background music is augmenting the soft focus of the movie. It somehow remind me of VV Chopra's Kareeb in which neha and to some extent Bobby did full justice to the character. Same here in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting. The Supporting cast are too good. I rate the actress playing the role of Bhabhi in the front league. The situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters. Songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie. However though I respect Ravindra Jain for his body of work from movies to Ramayana I missed Ram Laxman badly. It had no double entendres(Sivan category) no bikinis no intrigue and no nonsense. You would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged. I want to express on candid thing here that though Suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals his approach is totally individualistic. The movie is only about Prem & Poonam rest of the characters are incidental. Art immitating life? The peripheral characters are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair. Coming back Everything was almost great. Except for the drama part. The situation of tragedy was artificially created. The outcome the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all. That is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events. But a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a 'feature film'. But I kept waiting for the punch and it never came. The preaching by Mohnish Bahal and later by Alok Nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard. May be this will help the movie a tax-free status. But the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was. There were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 Has the movie really ended? 2 Has the movie ended? ",positive
" By Hook or By Crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and it's beautifully shot by Ann T. Rosetti and wonderfully written -- truly poetic. The lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model/inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere. This film has so much energy so much poignant passion and scruffy San Francisco heart to it. I can't recommend it highly enough! The best butch buddy movie of all time! ",positive
" OK this movie starts out like a cheesy Lifetime movie and doesn't get better till almost well through the movie. The script is full of 'cheese' and 'fluff' and cast is not well directed for the most part. For the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerves. I do not think this is one of her best acting jobs. The only reason I bought the movie is because it was on sale and had Ellen Burstyn in it. She's terrific but this is also not one of her best acting gigs. The story is based on true events and that helps the movie. Actually I didn't even like the movie at first and was getting disgusted when I saw stills of the balloon traveling I mean..let it get where it's suppose to go and be done with it! But all is forgiven by the time it does reach it's destination and the story comes to a close. If this doesn't bring a tear to your eye nothing will! It's cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again. ",positive

" My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section but I couldn't find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the U.S. in Feb. 1955. I saw it in a first run theater in Washington D.C. in March 1958. Wonder if it was re-released or some problem? In my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters. John McIntyre does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge/entrepreneur/thief. Walter Brennan does basically the same role he did in Red River years earlier. And in my opinion James Stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did. I have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again. The photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes. ",positive
" There's more to offer in the opening of The Odd Couple than in the entirety of most films. Felix Unger (the poor guy's monogram even curses him) checks into a New York hotel. A cleaning lady says Good night. Goodbye he answers back. In his room he empties his pockets then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope addressed to his wife and beloved children. When the viewer finally puts it together  aha he's going to off himself  we watch him struggle to open the window  oh no he's going to jump  The poor guy injures his lower back. This is all you need to know about Felix Unger  his wife has left him he's a compulsive cleaner and he's a hypochondriac. And all in one scene. This is the particular genius of Neil Simon's comedy  it's about situation and character. There are few obvious physical jokes  no kicks to the groin no cheap gags  just funny characters in uncomfortable situations. And of course he is a master of manipulating the audience's expectations. Coming from the Swingers era imagine what I thought in the date scene when Felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate Oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment. He's blowing it right? Think again. The girls love his sensitivity his ability to cry in front of them. They invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because Oscar wasn't paying enough attention to it. He's in like Flynn right? Uh yes but he doesn't want to go with the girls because he's feeling vulnerable. Great stuff. And it's made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight-room apartment set. You've got Jack Lemmon and the slouchy pouchy Walter Matthau for Chrissakes why mess it up? The visual style reminded me of Breakfast at Tiffany's in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action. Particularly memorable is the scene in which Felix fleeing from Oscar closes a partition only to realize the partition doesn't cover the side where Oscar is coming from. You get a real sense of the layout of the apartment and thus the proximity in which the two divorcées live. The twist here is that these two are really married  to each other. So the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys. ",positive
" A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. I think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo but it does matter for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand that is why his character would be attracted to hers but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his. Still the movie works as a light romantic fantasy. The scene where she stares at him across the cat's head with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring is true magic. It's a little jarring therefore when the scene shifts to the top of the Flatiron Building and we see the age difference very sharply. As he embraces her she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee. ",positive
" Not wishing to give *anything* away here I would just say this technically excellent flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half's entertainment: It will amuse surprise possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time as it approaches the inevitable but not obvious ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way. Most definitely recommended. A previous User's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's outstanding performances - I agree entirely.... ",positive

Watch it soon! ",positive
" I never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box. I always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90's. But after I saw on the internet that this was meant for the TV I was shocked because for a television film it is absolutely fantastic! The thing that mostly concerned me was the length. I felt that the one on one battle scene should've been removed as it was completely unnecessary. Also it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end. On the plus side there is a strong very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a bit haggard. I also felt that Gogool who looked dementing turned a bit stupid at some scenes. I was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of Africa. Also the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9. Still its a great film for the television. 8 out of 10. ",positive
" This is an entertaining look at the Gospel as presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black of course) who sings a lot and narrates a bit also. If you like Johnny Cash this film is quite enjoyable.

Anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all. ",positive
" ...but the general moviegoer's mileage may vary in Mary American Psycho Harron's stylized look at the American sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal Queen of Curves Bettie Page. I'll not bore anyone with a recitation of the iconic status of Ms. Page a prim and proper valedictorian from Nashville Tennessee who moved to New York in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the Bondage Queen of the Universe. Nor will I run through the sketchy bio-pic plot of The Notorious Bettie Page though I offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film (a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind) improper use of a period camera notwithstanding. Finally I won't belabor the timely applicability of the film's themes of innocence and perversion freedom and control the sacred and the secular; they're there for the viewer to absorb if they wish. The more things change the more they stay the same as the saying goes. What I will ramble on about for a moment is the splendid performance of Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page. Truth is Mol's face looks almost nothing like Bettie's nor is she particularly built like Bettie (although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts and no fool I!). She doesn't even sport the thick dark bush that concealed Ms. Page's most intimate charms but the fact remains that Mol thoroughly embodies the spirit of Bettie Page in every way shape and form. It is a bravura comeback from an undeserved semi-obscurity. I've never met Ms. Page (and sadly never will most likely) but I've devoured the photos and videos and read all the bios and interviews available bought the trading cards and other odds and ends and to be honest lusted for Ms. Page ever since I first discovered her in my adolescence between the covers of dusty tease magazines at the barber shop and the five and dime. Mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as I have come to conceive her no pun intended in what I consider to be an Oscar-worthy performance. Liv Tyler could never have matched Mol's shining intensity of characterization in a million years and I for one am grateful she left the project. Not that I'd mind seeing her totally naked I hasten to add but I can't imagine that her brand of sensuality would have translated into the innocent exhuberance of Bettie Page. The Notorious Bettie Page is not for everyone any more than bondage and discipline are. I suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters; legions of devoted Page fans and the curious will see to that. I can only hope that the DVD will be chock full of enough Bettie extras to show the uninitiated just how good a job Mol has done. Beyond that a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast especially Lili Taylor and Chris Bauer as Paula and Irving Klaw whose celebrity photo business was Bettie's doorway to immortality. A final note to the young scribe who opined that Ms. Page had no effect on his generation: take a good look at Madonna's cone brassiere and get back to us. Bettie Page is whether you know it or not the true Godmother of fetishwear. Without her Madonna and the rest of her kin could never have existed. ",positive
" Despite of the success in comedy or drama the Turkish directors are failure in horror-thriller. Okul-D@bbe are good examples for the awful horror Turkish films. But if you watch Gen you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark. Also the special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks fit the movie but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary. As a result Gen does not add any difference to horror movies but it does not disappoint thriller fans. In this respect it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10) ",positive
" The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric delivered a fantastic performance as Kid Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Far superior to The Grifters which was a good movie this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction/film noir roots from which the story came. I recommend this movie to all film noir fans.

" The plot is real horrific the atmosphere really depressive unusual for a low-budget production like that and at least for a German production. A little bit of Indian spirituality mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together. The development of plot and characters are great the sets very close to reality without any studio-atmosphere. It could be perfect but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing what don't inevitably have to be typically for low-budget movies: 1.) The cast sometimes is not more than average. Almost every actor look like a layman. Some of them do a good or a very good job but some are acting like the actors of crappy German court-shows! But I was very very disappointed of the acting of Mathieu Carrière! His acting ( in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine ) here was below-average! But that could be the reason why he today takes part in crappy German soaps or TV-series on private channels. 2.) The dialogs are sometimes on soap-opera-level. 3.) The bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand what the characters are saying. I saw it on DVD and was glad to could rewind and to listen it again. It caused by the set ( big halls as in the hospital or with the esoterically group ) and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors! But all in all it is an interesting movie worth to watch it far beyond the commercially movies which are often more terrible. ",positive

" This film is worth seeing alone for Jared Harris' outstanding portrayal of John Lennon. It doesn't matter that Harris doesn't exactly resemble Lennon; his mannerisms expressions posture accent and attitude are pure Lennon.

" George and Kim are traveling with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch.But what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit half animal and half man Wendigo haunts a small town... Wendigo by Larry Fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama.The acting is great the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments.The subtle glimpses of Wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined or even if the story is taking place entirely in Miles' head.Overall Wendigo is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and surely won't be the last.Give this film a chance if you don't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10.

" I saw this film at the Taos Film Festival last year and was just overwhelmed by it. It's a rich warm novel brought to the screen beautifully acted and well directed. More than anything it reminded me of the films of David Lean both in its ability to handle a complex story and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels. The best movie I've seen in years. ",positive
" I remember when this film was up for the Academy Awards and did not win in any category. For the life of me I cannot remember what it was up against but one thing I can say: It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not persuade me one bit. Essentially it is about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she is growing up from a girl to a woman. There are a lot of insinuations that are disturbing and horrifying but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with. Along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their hardships and walk with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie. Danny Glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film. And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects humanely not like some sideshow freak shows like the more recent Beloved did. I encourage anyone of any race to see this film. 9/10 ",positive

" Coonskin might be my favorite Ralph Bakshi film. Like the best of his work it's in-your-face and not ashamed of it for a second but unlike some of his other work (even when he's at his finest which was before and after Coonskin with Heavy Traffic and Wizards) it's not much uneven despite appearances to the contrary. Bakshi's taking on stereotypes and perceptions of race of course but moreover he's making what appears to be a freewheeling exploitation film; blaxploitation almost though Bakshi doesn't stop just there. If it were just a blaxploitation flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature. But Bakshi's aims are higher: throwing up these grotesque and exaggerated images of not just black people but Italians/mafioso homosexuals Jews overall New York-types in the urban quarters of Manhattan in the 70s he isn't out to make anything realistic. The most normal looking creation in looking drawn real is in fact a naked woman painted red white and blue. In mocking these stereotypes and conventions and horrible forms of racism (i.e. the tar-rabbit baby joke yes joke plus black-face) we're looking at abstraction to a grand degree. And best of all Bakshi doesn't take himself too seriously unlike Spike Lee with a film like Bamboozled in delivering his message. This is why for the most part Coonskin is a hilarious piece of work where some of the images and things done and sudden twists and of course scenes of awkward behavior (I loved the scene where the three animated characters are being talked at by the real-life white couple in tux and dress as looking colorful and the like) are just too much not to laugh at. It's not just the imagery which is in and of itself incredibly over -stylized but that the screenplay is sharp and this is key for Bakshi this time considering it's got a fairly cohesive narrative to string along the improvisations and madness. Using at first live-action then animation and then an extremely clever matching of the two (ironically what Bakshi later went for in commercial form with Cool World is done here to a T with less money and a rougher edge) Pappy and Randy are waiting outside a prison wall for a buddy to escape and Pappy tells of the story of Brother Rabbit who with Brother Bear and Preacher Fox go to Harlem and become big-time hoodlums with Rabbit in direct opposition to a Jabba-the-Hut-esquire Godfather character. This is obviously a take off on Song of the South with its intentionally happy-go-lucky plot and animation here taken apart and shown for how rotten and offensive it really is. Yet Bakshi goes for broke in combining forms; animated characters stand behind and move along with live-action backgrounds; when violence and gunshots and fights occurs it's as bloody as it can get for 1975; when a dirty cop is at a bar and is drugged and put in black-face and a dress he trips in a manner of which not even Disney could reach with Dumbo; a boxing match with Brother Bear and an opponent as the climax is filmed in wild slow-motion; archive footage comes on from time to time of old movies some and some from the 20s that are just tasteless. Like Mel Brooks or Kubrick or more recently South Park Bakshi's Coonskin functions as entertainment first and then thought-provocation second. It's also audacious film-making on an independent scale; everything from the long takes to the montage and the endlessly warped designs for the characters (however all based on the theme of the piece) all serve the thought in the script where its B-movie plot opens up much more for interpretation. To call it racist misses the point; it's like calling Dr. Strangelove pro-atomic desolation or Confederate States of America pro slavery. And for me it's one of the best satires ever made. ",positive
" This movie contains one of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor. Also this movie is funny yet has a serious side as well. What is especially intriguing about this movie is the character Madonna who is the dictator's mistress but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna's evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movie's entertainment value. And the main character who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect. I liked this movie. ",positive
" I saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class. Were to mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas on quality(of the product). I did rent this one back in the eighties and I remember it to be good(but not great)movie. I've always liked Michael Keaton's style and delivery. He was a perfect fit for the movie. I am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie. I grant you yes it's no Oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value. It's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all-out comedy farce. I also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences. I beg to differ. I grant you again that there are a lot of generalities and dramatizations but then again this is Hollywood film not a documentary. From what I've read about differences between Automakers on both sides of the Pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time. Some of the basic differences were that Japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole. Teamwork was emphasized. They perhaps made the company above all else. Where American workers had more of a management verses labor type of relationship. The individual was more important than the company. I'll probably get some hate email over that comment I'm sure. Another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix. In many Japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered. Rather as one character in the movie put it it was the dealers(meaning car dealer) problem . Many of these things are probably dated but I'm sure some are still around as many US car makers are still struggling to keep up with the Japanese. If one is more interested in the subject of American European and Japanese automakers I can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period. The book is called The machine that changed the world by James Womack Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. It's about a study of automakers during and before the time period that this movie covers. Parts are bit dry but I think you'll find that it backs up much the movie also. ",positive
" Two great comedians in a great Neil Simon movie based on his hit play. Great combination especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. Small wonder why Burns won an Oscar for this; he's as sharp and as funny as ever. And Matthau is every bit his match if a tad more crotchety. This is familiar Simon territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a TV special but still can't stand one another after all these years. It's a delight to watch these two pick at each other their scenes together make this film an absolute delight. Myself I especially enjoyed the knock knock knock / ENTER! scene. And if you're a fan of either Burns or Matthau you'll enjoy it too. In fact you'll enjoy the whole movie. Ten stars. Put a little Sunshine in your life. ",positive

I only wish that someone would release the DVD because my VHS tape is about worn out! If you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It is military humor at it's best and worse! Rent it if you can't own it! ",positive
" This film is really cool. every thing looks like it came out of the comic book. the sets the costumes and the plot is great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite batman. he looked a bit better in dead end but he still pulls it off. superman is great too. the flying effects are OK. but its a fan-film so we cant expect them to be the greatest. the shot with superman catching the car was VERY believable. it was cool. This is a movie i would definitely see if it were real. its got every thing you would want in a batman/ superman movie. one exception though i would cast the joker instead of 2-face..... overall i give this film a 10 because its a great film.

" Grand epic as it is Kenneth Branagh's monumental rendering of what is perhaps William Shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power. Two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making. While I absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such I must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance his rhetoric (and he sends himself up so well) and his many flourishes. Thus Hamlet loses its impact as it loses its grip. From Patrick Doyle's music to Alex Thomson's cinematography to Tim Harvey's exquisite sets the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights which compliments a fine cast. Branagh has taken on three huge mantels adapting directing and playing. His adaptation is superb his direction strong but by the time he got to the role of Hamlet the strain seemed to be showing; yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role. Derek Jacobi gobbles up the sinister Claudius with glee and Julie Christie is most dramatic as his queen Gertrude. Richard Briers is marvellous as Polonius and Charlton Heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player King. Many others drop by including Jack Lemmon (superb in a very small role) Billy Crystal Dame Judi Dench Sir John Mills Sir John Gielgud Sir Richard Attenborough and Gerard Depardieu. The acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years Kate Winslet. Hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair Ophelia. To finish (before this review goes on longer than the film) I must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie. Branagh has directed with purpose giving many important impacting scenes. Too many of them outstay their welcome. Watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it. Neither a lender nor a borrower be or Be true to thyself . And of course: To be or not to be . The opening two hours does take some perseverance but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward.

" Due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was I didn't go and see this film at the cinema. After watching it on DVD I have to say I regret that now. I'm not saying it is brilliant but I would venture to say that it is a good movie. I enjoyed it. People have skulls thicker than Ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. I don't think Ganghis Kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. What kind of man Ned Kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems. In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians Ned Kelly has become a legend. Legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself. Ned Kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of Australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority. A society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger. So not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical Kelly gang I actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. It was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow Australians watch 'The Lighthorseman' and you will see what I mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly). Perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers. Ironically I actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on Ned's story would dwell. And they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians. This movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to Australians; perhaps a little of Ned's spirit is in this movie because I think it rebelled against people's expectations and unfortunately missed both targets. Fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film. For me it was an unexpected kind of movie about Ned and that is why I liked it. Orlando Bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something. I think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf for a change. When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered. Send me this on DVD for christmas rather than Croc Dundee or The Man From Snowy River anytime. ",positive
" I don't hand out ten star ratings easily. A movie really has to impress me and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours. From the moment that the opening title appeared I knew we were in for a ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again: the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera. However for me that last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the suspense. I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD simply because it is genius. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy. ",positive

" I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining quite possibly the scariest movie ever. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad? One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent and the rooms are huge yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator. The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie but is definitely a goodie. 8/10 ",positive
" After growing up in the gritty streets of Detroit MI and having friends who traveled to New York balls I fell into the lifestyle of being a House member. I joined the House of Theieves. We adapted the same rules as most houses but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired. I even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver's license and cash them in over seventeen states until a jealous queen called the Secret Service on me and I went to Federal prison. But I learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I highly recommend you watch it yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in the houses here in Detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in.

" Troubled men's magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan) has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models. When the lovely ladies start turning up dead for real Adrien worries that he might be the killer. Writer/director William Byron Hillman relates the engrossing story at a steady pace builds a reasonable amount of tension delivers a few gruesomely effective moments of savage misogynistic violence (one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake in it placed over her head rates as the definite squirm-inducing highlight) puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn and engaging true-to-life characters further grounds everything in a plausible everyday world and tops things off with a nice smattering of tasty female nudity. The fine acting from an excellent cast helps matters a whole lot: Joanna Pettet as sunny charming love interest Mindy Jordache James Stacy as Adrien's macho double amputee brother B.J. Seymour Cassel as Adrien's concerned psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis Don Potter as Adrien's feisty gay assistant Louis Pamela Hensley as gutsy homicide detective Sergeant Fountain Cleavon Little as a hard-nosed police chief and Misty Rowe as sweet bubbly model Bambi. R. Michael Stringer's polished cinematography makes impressive occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots. Jack Goga's ominous rattling score likewise does the trick. Popping up in cool bit parts are Robert Tessier as a gruff bartender Sally Kirkland as a saucy hooker Kathy Shower as a fierce female wrestler B.J. grapples with in the ring and Frances Bay in one of her standard old woman roles. A solid and enjoyable picture. ",positive
" The stories in this video are very entertaining and it definately is worth a look! The first one concerns a young couple harrassed in the woods by two rednecks with a great but unexplained twist at the end. The seond is the best of the lot and it alone makes this worth watching - A man is attacked by a dog which he fears to be rabid - He finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be...... Great twist at the end and this episode alone scores 10/10! If the others were up to par with this one this would get 10/10! The third is the weakest of the bunch - A girl meets with some guys and has wild sex! There appears to be no point to the story until the end with a good little twist but it is spoiled by the awful first part! Never the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all! Well worth a rental! ",positive
" A wrong-doer is often a man that has left something undone not always he that has done something. --Emperor Marcus Aurelius The DVD release of Watch on the Rhine could not come at a better moment. It restores to us a major Lillian Hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by Dashiell Hammett (Hellman scholar Bernard F. Dick's audio commentary affirms his authorship). It presents a subtle performance by Bette Davis who took a subdued secondary role long after she'd become the workhorse queen at the Warner Bros. lot. Equally significantly it reminds us that World War II had a purpose. Sure you say like we needed that. We've heard Cary Grant sermonizing in Destination Tokyo (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We've watched jackboots stomp the living hills in The Sound of Music (1965). We've toured an England callously occupied by Germany in It Happened Here (1966). Yet truth to tell we still need the message spread. I have an 81-year-old friend who curses Franklin Roosevelt regularly. He feels that FDR connived the U.S. into a foreign fight we didn't need and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin. He's encouraged in his demonizing of Allied leaders and the trivializing of War Two by Patrick Buchanan. The political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that Adolf Hitler would have posed no further menace to Poland Europe or the world if only the Third Reich had been handed the Free City of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan holds that if those selfish Poles hadn't confronted the Nazis drawing in foolishly meddling Britain and giddily altruistic France no war would have engulfed the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a Final Solution to the Jewish Problem. Some commenters on this site feel that Watch sags under the weight of stale propaganda. Maybe. However neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem to have gotten the film's point: Some people hurt and kill to grab other people's land goods and liberty; such people dominated the Axis Powers and enough didn't appear in their vocabulary. Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors. They give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines for actively facing down torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman didn't care for Lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical. Of course as a Hungarian he had seen first-hand Bela Kun's bloody dictatorship of the proletariat replace an outmoded empire and then topple to Admiral Horthy's right-wing tyranny. In a marvelous cameo role added to the play by Hammett Henry Daniell sardonically depicts a Wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would doubtless stand with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the Plot of July 20th against Hitler. In April 1940 however he pragmatically abets the Nazi cause although he insults Herr Blecher the Butcher and scorns the Rumanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for trying to peddle information on an Underground leader. Teck a pauper and possible cuckold wishes cash and a visa to return to Europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire-shattering Great War and the greater world-wide economic Depression. He has no political convictions no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow. Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris lends this burnt-out case's Old World cynicism an edge of desperate menace. Lucille Watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man's hostess a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way--but who doesn't adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls. She and her pallid office-bound son belong to the American version of von Ramme's and de Brancovis' privileged kind. However this family hasn't seen ruin and never will. They're moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it. This mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward National Socialism and Fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit Buchanan. Watch on the Rhine has a manicured period look. Its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets. Yet Hellman and Hammett's film has gut-based power. Audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march. ",positive
" I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst...because of everyone else's bad reviews. I thought: Even though I don't read the books that doesn't look anything like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure it wasn't a carbon copy of the books but when you make a movie out of something you have to modify it to become big-screen entertainment. The plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements at no point in this film does Nancy come off as a ditz. She was intelligent conservative polite and genuine. One thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy romance suspense and heartfelt moments. I loved this movie. What a flick what a flick! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was like freaking out! Go see it or be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...a mistake I almost made. I love it I wanna own this movie! I love Emma Roberts now too. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it love it. ",positive
" I only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with Opening Night and that's Bergman';s Persona. Both movies are simply amazing they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight. We have a profound meditation on the relation of art and life as one actress Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to. The accidental death of one of her fans a young girl that declares her love for Myrtle and she is then hit by a car leaves a deep mark in the actress. She starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that doesn't help to much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness. The scene where she kill the imaginary (or not) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes I found in a Cassavets film. The movie ends with a display of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene since Myrtle comes too drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately. This scene was filmed spontaneously with a live audience the laughter is genuine the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands absolutely amazing. If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine. ",positive
" i totally disagree.i thought that this was a great movie for kids.dawn wells from gilligans island and promise shown of a barely then known dana plato.it was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff.no it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to be.i wont ruin the ending.but it was unusual the way that it was done.i mean the kids characters were great and i didn't know what to expect in the end.the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially.it also helps them out of a jam towards the end.it also has the plus of not being overly long.i think it clocks in at under 95 minutes ",positive
" If you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars? It's not as if they're inexperienced in front of the camera they have no qualms with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name? Christian Viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard-gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema's sexiest and most notorious stars. Jenna Jameson Chasey Lain Ginger Lynn Allen and Taylor Hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since Scream Reinvigorated the genre. Samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in October 2002 - thus keeping in check with the Halloween-based synopsis. Unfortunately the shoot was plagued by numerous problems which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves. Last I heard it had been signed by Film 2000 here in the UK and was penned for a late October release direct to DVD. Unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with DTV slashers. Not content with polluting our shelves with Camp Blood and its follow up they were also responsible for unleashing Granny Bleed and the rancid Paranoid. Could Samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon? Five Canadian/American students and their teacher head to Southern Ireland as part of their history course. Upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of Scotland and murdered locals for food. The cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake but it's rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of Ireland to find refuge. After the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre-fodder does in these flicks the mandatory goody two-shoes (and definite heroine candidate) begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night. Could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the Forest? Well what do you think? It looks as if Samhain's production was jinxed right from the start. Almost immediately Wallmart refused to develop Jenna Jameson's nude make-up shots and Chasey Lain began acting characteristically like a drugged-out primadonna. Finally to add insult to injury the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re-editing and removing all the gore. Reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an R rating. Veil of course disagreed seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display. Eventually after months of arguments the director parted company with Warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults. Despite countless disruptions Veil's slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium. The copy I was sent was the pre-release screener which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack. But still it boasted a few credible jump-scares some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that I've seen for some time. One guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine Jenna Jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and Chasey Lain ends up 'spilling her guts' after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend (Richard Grieco). Even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome Samhain never feels mean spirited which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clichés. In all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall because the dialogue was not so much inspired by Wes Craven's Scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them. Certainly the inclusion of the mouth-watering Jenna Jameson was a great move by the producers. Her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top (as expected) and so does Chasey Lain and Taylor Hayes. But Samhain is no soft porn movie and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce. It's worth noting that the aforementioned XXX stars almost out-perform the supposed 'actors' of the feature which isn't much of a complement. Ginger Lynn was at least notable (if you ignore the shameful 'Oirish accent) and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by Alan Chou. Taylor and Jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics which could have been caused by the numerous problems on-set. Veil's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much-needed injections of suspense. Exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds. It will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of Samhain. Rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending and I'm curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution. If the end result is only half as good as the rough print that I watched then it's still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years. This one is certainly worth checking out ",positive
" When I was chairman of our college's coffeehouse one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to come along in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that it was being shown off-off Broadway in theaters where television monitors were being placed throughout the audience so everyone had a great seat. The premise was that the skits would change on a regular basis-ala Saturday Night Live keeping the thing fresh. They decided on making it into a film for general distribution. I believe the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was on film. Watching him run naked though the woods was a howl. Like many of the reviews before mine it WAS Saturday Night Live before such a thing existed. I highly recommend this vid. I've told my 13 year old son about Koko the clown- He can't wait to get a copy! ",positive
" Having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on Rialto Channel I found it to be a pleasant poignant and enriching film. The casting was excellent. I loved all the characters they were a little exaggerated in places (but this IS a film). The way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly as real life can and does. Yes I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities (I find this quite wierd because she's always a solid actress in my opinion). I loved the bit at the end where Andy's character said sometimes I feel he was never here etc. it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that (which I can personally identify with) then there was that gorgeous classical piece Nocturne I think by Chopin which was a beautiful way to end (bar the light comedy at the end which was probably unnecessary). I say well done to the film makers - I have seen 1 000s of worse films! ",positive
" For anyone who wishes to get an impression of the Soviet view of modern Russian history this monumental film is a treasure. The story starts at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times (i.e. the 1960s). The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. He later joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village. His son by the local beauty fights the Germans during the Second World War. When he returns to the village the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some Soviet economic idealism. This film is long and slow but utterly logic and very well made. It can be seen in three parts. ",positive
" An ultra-nervous old man Mr. Goodrich terrorized by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing really panics when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it saying You will be next! He calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier. Of course it's the Stooges who couldn't respond because had come into the office robbed them and tied them up. Some detectives! The moment poor Mr. Goodrich hangs up the phone and says I feel safer already a monster-type goon named Nico appears out of a secret panel in the room and chokes him unconscious. We next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that. Now these crooks have to deal with the detectives that are coming by the house for Mr. Goodrich. Some of the gags like Moe and Larry's wrinkles are getting a bit old but some of them will provoke laughs if I see them 100 times. I always laugh at Shemp trying to be a flirt as he does here with Mr. Goodrich's niece in a classic routine with a long accordion-like camera lens. The act he puts on when he's poisoned is always funny too. Shemp was so good that I didn't mind he was taking the great Curly's place. Larry Moe Curly/Shemp were always great in the chase scenes in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house. That's the last six minutes in here. At times such as this film  ",positive
" I couldn't have been more thrilled; Just eight years old back in 1983 I was going to see a Star Wars movie at the theater! The best day of my life was about to happen. To that time my only Star Wars experience had been a few HBO showings of Star Wars. I hadn't even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet. And boy did that day deliver for my less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceships. The Emporer. A green-bladed lightsaber!! Wow! Since that magical day I must have watched this movie hundreds of times. I can't even form an accurate estimate at this point. With those multiple viewings I have of course observed that this movie - the REAL Episode III - does have its flaws. Of course in the context of a Star Wars movie those flaws are more like quirks . Millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May of 1983 I had mine. And this was my Star Wars movie. ",positive
" Making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress. And everybody's mind's-eye opus is different which is why when the 'REAL' movie finally comes out you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up. All a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see. There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of Stephen King. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (CARRIE 'SALEM'S LOT THE DEAD ZONE) or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess (Kubrick's version of THE SHINING; the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS). Although it's not even close to being the perfect King adaptation PET SEMATARY has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. For that we have music video-turned-film director Mary Lambert to thank (she also directed SIESTA not exactly a horror movie but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list) working from a screenplay by the 'Man-ster' Himself and probably one of his better ones. Since the majority of you know the story I won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. Well almost perfect except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well even if you haven't read the book do the frickin' math. It IS a King story after all so no mystery where this is headed. It's not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way. Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery scream-inducing life here: Rachel Creed's (STAR TREK'S Denise Crosby) horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister; Louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) both before and after his death; the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulse. Good performances by all here especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor Jud Crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up: Sometimes dead is better. About the only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis's son Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this Lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately Hughes at the time was just too damn CUTE to sell his intended role as an evil demon-possessed zombie. This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged (especially Gwynne's death scene.) Other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I'm concerned; but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five. Still will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not BLOODY likely...for now. ",positive
" Not so many people like the movies of Bertrand blier simply because they don't understand them. Simply because they are different kinds of people. If you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here. And also the film of blier cannot be classified easily as black-comedy or cult etc. like those of pulp fiction etc. Because there is this delicacy which the audience of north-america frequently fail to appreciate. When I looked at these two `hooligans' dining with Jeanne moreau in the seaside restaurant I felt they were more gentil than any gentleman can have been. The urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being-symbolized by the camion suddenly emerges at the Carrefour. SO les valseuses is much better a name than going places. To dance a valse you need to be elegant but going places you don't. ",positive
" This is an OK adaptation but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally alright but I found Jeremy Northam rather wet as Mr Knightley particularly compared to Mark Strong in the TV version. Gwyneth Paltrow is OK and her English accent is pretty good but again I preferred Kate Beckinsale's Emma. There are excellent support performances from Toni Collette Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. The script is often played too much for laughs the book is a comedy but there are too many set-piece gags here and also the Frank Churchill subplot is almost completely absent. My biggest criticism is the scenery. It is far too lush. England has never been like this. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans would make it like this. Despite these criticisms I enjoyed this film but would recommend the TV adaptation more. ",positive

I like Modesty's character. Actually she's very mystic and mysterious (I DO like that^^). The bad boy is pretty too. Well actually this whole movie is rare in 'movieworld'. I considered about the vote of this movie I thought this is should be a very popular movie. I guess wrong. It was ME who was very impressed about this movie and I hope I'm not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one. See and vote. ",positive

" This film is one of the finest American B-movies of the 90s. If you're looking for a serious film look elsewhere. However if you're looking for some action a lot of laughs and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters this is well worth watching. Everyone chews the scenery a bit but that's really what the film is all about and everyone is quite funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together. ",positive
" The Last Big Thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best... Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called The Next Big Thing . Thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitch-slap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend Darla is also writing a magazine (which is real) which mainly has to do with her and Simon as well as her and her father. Darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best. Brent is a flat character with not much to him as is Tedra the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands. Still these characters weave a very interesting web together. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. Its a wonderful film and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd. Mark my words!

" If it's action and adventure you want in a movie then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere. On the other hand if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood check out The Straight Story. Richard Farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight in this true story of Alvin's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke. Farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels his long and winding road making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way. The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching waiting for the next life lesson Alvin's going to offer. Stretch out on the couch relax and enjoy. It's the only way to watch this very good movie which rates a 7/10 in my book. ",positive
" This is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything including the television networks. One of their most popular TV shows is The Running Man where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions. It's set up like a game show where the audience votes for their favorite stalkers trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky contestants . Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. And the host is played by none other than Family Feud's Richard Dawson who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder he is forced to play this sadistic game. This movie is chock full of classic Arnold one-liners such as his famous I'll be back right before he enters the arena. And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with How about a light? I could go on and on but I don't want to spoil the movie. It's funny stuff! Whether it was intended or not this movie serves as a great parody of today's Reality TV craze. Already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers and even court cases are televised for their entertainment value . Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit rock bottom and it is a scary picture. One can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far. Overall this is a fun film & I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10! ",positive
" I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick Snuff . I was told that Devil's Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one so my interest was peaked. Devil's Experiment is a short film with no story no character development. Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways like beating her spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol forcing her to listen to hi-pitched noise for 24 hours smash her hand with a mallet burning and putting maggots on the burns throwing guts at her and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye. I must say that a lot of this movie was fake like the beating scenes. But then some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought Damn that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie . I did enjoy the flick but I don't know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10 ",positive
" Highly memorable intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of French movies' true geniuses the formidably able Henri Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel of the JFK assassination and takes place in a non-descript fictional country. The film visually as well as plot-wise is razor-sharp. Shot with meticulous precision it follows Henry Volnay the Procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup. In many ways it's a very disturbing movie not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a so-called modern state's inner workings. The atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable and Verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting. On another level this relatively little-known movie just had a 15 years head-start on Oliver Stone who was acclaimed for the JFK movie a inferior film in many areas the least of which not being credibility... It's a masterpiece any cinema lover should see it preferably in its original French version with subs. ",positive
" This was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie and quite true to my own experience of bulimia. It was actually well-researched and I can only assume it was written by someone who's gone through a similar experience because it had all the little details. The characters were quite well-drawn and the performances by Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think what I like most was that they made them specific and smart and there was no dumbing down of the reasons for Beth's bulimia (it wasn't some diet gone out of control caused by the pressures placed on girls by the media pressures we're not actually going to address... ). Her mother wasn't completely clueless - too often on television they'll take an issue that EVERYONE has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who don't ( Diabetes? What's that? Oh my world is all askew doctor please explain it all to me as if I'm a small child etc). It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didn't see the signs. And the scenes where Beth was throwing up weren't OVERLY melodramatic and sensationalist and concentrated more on bulimics' need for secrecy and their out-of-controlness. The scene where Beth tells her mother she's bulimic would've made me cry if there hadn't been other people in the room. Okay so I liked those bits. What didn't work for me so well was the ending which headed back to the TV movie territory we know and don't particularly love but I guess they had to wrap it up. You too can cure your child's eating disorder if you have lots and lots of money and live in America... And can I just say again that I really like Mare Winningham. She's great. ",positive
" What a delightful film... Accompanied by Oscar-winning Composer RACHEL PORTMAN's lush emotional and dreamy music this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year. Incredible casting... Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for the role of Emma. Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith. The character who stole the film was MISS BATES!!! She was mesmerizing to watch one finds oneself on the edge of ones' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically WITH her. One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages. From one of the opening scenes when she is thanking Mr. Woodhouse for sending that lovely quarter-hind of pork... PORK MOTHER!!! she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired Mother Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother Phyllida Law) who looks forlorn and lost. The comical ways that Emma would avoid the grating Miss Bates builds itself up for one truly gut-wrenching scene at the picnic when Emma insults Miss Bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart. We then see poor Miss Bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one's heart ripped out to her on her behalf. It is a classic scene one to be rewound and played over & over... The ending is right up there with Sense & Sensibility and provides one of life's greatest lessons about how one should marry one's best friend... I hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself. I ADORED it! ",positive
" I thought this movie was very well put together. The voice-overs were also great. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me glad. It is a movie any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy profesor or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. After I watched the movie I read the book. It was good as well but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. It is just like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie! ",positive
" Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a Pre-Code film. It involves realistic events with truly enjoyable and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill a free soul without a dime in his pocket. He makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings. One night he meets Trina a beauty by any standards who is cold and alone. She has refused to resort to prostitution so she has not eaten for several days but the two take very well to each other and form a relationship. His free spirit tempts him to leave her so life is rocky but there is a true spark between the two even if they live in a shack by the river. Tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen. His characters are amazing and relatable. We can see his thoughts on his face making him easy to identify with even if we believe he is behaving badly. Young is great in pre-code films. Her character is very sweet but far from perfect making her all the more likable. Pre-code elements include skinny dipping pregnancy before marriage and crime. ",positive
" This movie is banned in just about every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese people (?) who star in this must have been really desperate for a job or we're just friends. Here's the scoop: Three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her they burn her kick her spin here around in a chair (over 200 times!) they use sound torture (by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours! It don't sound that bad at all but it CAN make you go nuts). They throw guts (probably from an animal) at her while shes knocked out and she freaks when she wakes up. And who can forget the grande finale the GREATEST EYEBALL TORTURE I HAVE EVER SEEN! If you have not heard of these films and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film you will think it is! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick! Like I said pure underground. Check it out if you are a fan of underground horror or foreign gore. If your not I highly recommend you read-up on the series before watching! From the gore shock and creativity aspect it gets a 10 but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1. An underground classic... My final rating is a 8/10 ",positive
" I originally saw this film years ago during Cinemax Friday after dark series(back when the cable box was built like a keyboard) and it intrigued me. Even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted.The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable.They have a good chemistry together & Miou-Miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking.A movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times(at least not in the US) since it seems to sensationalize things like violence robbery & casual sex. This movie proves that with a talented cast & also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject.It saddened me to find out Patrick Dewaere committed suicide & in the near future I ll will check him out with Depardieu & Miou-Miou in Get Out Your Hankerchief.

" This early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically; note for examples the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery. Its core though remains the final match which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Even though you know that the hero has to win it becomes quite believable that he will lose and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his motivating the final plot pay-off is very well entwined with the progress of the match. The inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (even though this is a silent film the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them). The pacing becomes astonishingly rapid and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it. The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight a public domain company. As with each Hitchcock silent they've released they've attached various musical selections mostly orchestral to the action. The sound editing is frequently sloppy and the sound quality varies widely but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here. This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest. It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films. ",positive
" I got to see the movie On Thin Ice on the television in India.. I must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine.. the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted... however I felt that Diane Keaton was at her best... the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine... was the best... the two boys are good and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress she is....The script is well done as is the cinematography and direction.. and casting A must must watch movie..... for everyone ",positive
" Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie New York City firefighters. What they got was the only film footage inside the World Trade Center on September 11. Having worked with James Hanlon's ladder company before Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while Gédéon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened. An airplane flying low over the City distracted Jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One. Jules asked the captain to follow him into the Towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film. He stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there. The brothers Naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent grizzly and gory. But the language from the firefighters is a little coarse and CBS showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored. The brothers Naudet mixed footage they filmed with one-on-one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis. Unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from DVD sales go to 9/11-related charities. Very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date. ",positive
" This 1947 film stars and was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and also stars the gorgeous Rita Hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair. So I've hung out with Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man etc. but this was my first Rita Hayworth interaction. Our first meeting went well she does a superb job playing the frightened/cagey Elsa married to a crippled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to run away with her she doesn't know if she can live without the things money can buy. Elsa her husband and his partner bicker and bite just like the sharks Mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true. Several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house. (Think the ending shootout in The Man with the Golden Gun which borrowed heavily from this scene). I wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end. This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish centers on the sea it is subtle sour and pungent all to great effect. These might not be the best fresh shrimp but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy but filling alternative to more mundane common fare. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies ",positive
" With lots of sunshine gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms tracking shots moving through crowds with hand-held camera quick-paced editing and extreme close-ups here and there the photography is the thing in this interesting artistically done film. The plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest. The film begins on a warm Sunday at the local swimming pool where we meet the lovely Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a bit of a show-off in front of the gawking men by poolside she soon decides to enter herself to represent France in the Miss Europe beauty contest much to the chagrin of her very jealous stick-in-the-mud fiancé (a pretty annoying fellow really). Strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause (I was wondering couldn't the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time - and thus applause - on the catwalk?!). Lulu is soon being chased by a Prince and a Maharaja but her hot-headed beau doesn't like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public for that matter (I guess he just wants her in his house cooking his meals and staying out of sight eh?!). Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming her presence helps enhance this film but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most. A bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound which is a bit off. The print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though. Watching this I just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually and I found the movie to be excellent well worth seeing. ",positive
" Not many movies were made about the Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) aspect of aviation but this is one of them and it's damn good. Just a fun film to watch. Most of the movie takes place at the Navy blimp operations at NAS Lakehurst (with NAS Tustin playing the role). Wallace Beery plays a likable but Munchausen-like Senior Chief Ned Trumpet an enlisted pilot whose tall tales have gotten so frequent nobody really believes him. Half the fun is near the end of the movie when events start proving that most of his more outlandish tales are actually true. Set during WWII the main plot centers around bachelor Trumpet wooing a local widow only to end up having a father-son relationship with the widow's crippled son Jess. Told he would never walk without crutches by doctors Chief Trumpet pulls some strings and a Navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the lad's crippled leg. Jess goes on to join the Navy to become a flight officer flying blimps back at Lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges. A very well-done movie albeit not without some corny Hollywood dialogue slipping past the technical advisers and Beery's apparent inability to march in step. Otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy and gives a rare look into the Navy's LTA operations. The Cash Register Scene an exchange between Trumpet and Jess's future love interest Cathy is an absolute hoot. ",positive
" Meek tiny almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something enormous out of it. In front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces I had the pleasure to see and see and see again. It never let's me down. People even people who know me pretty well thought/think there was/is something wrong with me based on my attraction or I should say devotion for Le Locataire They may be right I don't know but there is something irresistibly enthralling within Polanski's darkness and I haven't even mentioned the humor. The mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant the mystery that takes over him and naturally us me. That building populated by great old Academy Award winners: Melvyn Douglas Shelley Winters Jo Van Fleet Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies this is compulsory viewing. One two three many many viewings. ",positive
" The makers have chosen the best people for the job and set the scene wonderfully. Every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it. Whether the period is the 20s (the first story) the present (ie 1950) for the middle story or the 1910s (the last) costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created. I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - exquisite lace overlaid by the finest Shetland shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing but never mind the soppy young lovers it's Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wife's health and independence who harrows our emotions. He usually played comical pompous types but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode (and also nicked a story by Kipling). I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband - though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a Mexican hat. I love that posh bird who plays his wife too. ",positive
" That 70s Show is the best TV show ever period. It's up there with the Andy Griffen Show Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. That 70s Show continued on for 8 seasons all of which focus around a group of teenagers/young adults dealing with relationships separating from their parents and their overall futures. The two main characters Eric and Donna are two teenagers living next door to each other. They have been living next door to each other for most of their lives and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. A large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working. Two other characters Red and Kitty are Eric's parents. Red was in the service so he really pushes Eric around. Kitty is just the opposite. Even though she drinks heavily she treats Eric and his friends with a lot of care. Bob their neighbor is obviously Donna's Dad. Bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show's story. Bob also annoys Red to his full extent. The remaining character Hyde Kelso Fez and Jackie are Eric's friends. They also play a major role in the show's story. Well the First Season is great. This is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other. The First Season is original funny and enjoyable. The Second Season is good although it isn't as good as the first. It is a basic continuation of the First. Eric and Donna are together and everything is working out great. The Third Season is my favorite. It went back and captured the First Season feel and humor. I also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch making the show all that more fun to watch. The Fourth Season isn't near as good. Eric and Donna Arne't together in this one making the show slightly less pleasurable. It is still funny although I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons. The Fifth Season is the last season I enjoyed all the way through. It is the gang's Senior Year so that really helps with the story. The Fifth Season also had the best ending out of all the seasons. The Sixth Season is good for the most part. It is extremely funny although it doesn't capture the feel that the other seasons did. The gang is out of High School so I believe that it didn't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did. I also didn't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them. The Seventh Season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way although it didn't do it all the way. I enjoyed the Seventh Season as I did all the others and the ending is great. The Last Season flat out sucked. Eric wasn't in it which ruined it. Kelso wasn't in it for the most part either which didn't help. I hated the Eighth Season up until the last episode. I thought that the last episode was really good and a fitting ending to the series. So overall if you enjoy comedy give That 70s Show a try. They stopped making new episodes but it is still on TV a bunch. I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7. It is up to you if you want to buy Season 8. ",positive
" When I saw the Dentist I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone especially people who do not like gory scenes as the Dentist has lots of gory scenes. That's why it has it's R18 rating. It's about a beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the poolman. It's best to go to your dentist before you watch this. But if you don't like going to the dentist already then it's best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life. the Dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that I've ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (Spoiler) pull out all his cheating wife's teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic? Overall awesome flick but not for everyone. ",positive
" My watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together...which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism... and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships! As a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved. I think the point where Jesse and Celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs... the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with... On the plot front making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish.. I believe in romantic flicks of such flavor the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind. What the actors bring out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify... to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story...here both the actors do just the RIGHT job! Kudos..!!!and Before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful! ",positive
" Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films i've seen in the last ten years..Excellent performances(especially yiannis zouganelis is great) well-written script and effective direction from a very special for the Greek very average standards auteur. A film obviously influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end. Nevertheless this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of Greek movies which should be watched outside Greece. It's a shame that in Greece didn't work commercially in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like Politiki Kouzina.. ",positive
" This movie pleasantly surprised me. It has a touching slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention. This is a movie I never heard about but if you want a sleeper this is it. Great writing production and acting. I highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are marvelous. Why wasn't more made of this movie?

" This is a film that can make you want to see it again. I especially liked the way it ended. I did not see the end coming but when Laws was not blown away the first time one suspects he will be back again. The story is gripping and could have been more psychological but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that. Hard to believe Michael Jr. could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away. But I can appreciate the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell. Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I believe that isn't justified. If his character had been any harder he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not. Eight Stars for this one. Although it was released in 2002 I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD. ",positive
" Lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids. That depends on the kid. This isn't a movie for a 2-6 year old; it's more geared toward the 8 years and older crowd. I saw this movie when I was 10 I absolutely loved it. At the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes. This movie deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little more emotional impact. In this movie characters can DIE and be sent to HELL! This gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives. The good guys aren't always perfectly sweet and nice (like other cartoons). They have real motivations like revenge and greed but also compassion and friendship; shows that things aren't always black and white. Excellent Movie ",positive
" Can I be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say I liked it ? It's reasonably funny by bits it got great stars and it's gorgeous to look at. The songs (there are about two which are then repeated) are forgettable but they get a healthy ironic treatment (such as the terribly handsome Mr Fairbanks exploding into frenzied Wagnerian version of the tender ballad Miss Grable has just rendered); there isn't much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around Miss Grable and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed but the result still is very uplifting. The photography (including real outdoor shots which are a thrill) is amazing playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold. Miss Grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side but still fresh and comfortable in this continental olde worlde comedy. It's pretty much along the line of Down to Earth with Rita Hayworth and that one tends to be rather disliked by many. So I suppose several people would deem That Lady in Ermine to be outdated and stuffy. But it's a fairy tale and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork the costumes the witty script and everything else this film has to offer and stop complaining. The film has been released on DVD in Germany with both German and English soundtrack. ",positive
" This movie is the first of Miikes triad society trilogy and the trilogy kicks of to a great start. The movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough. Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling their way to the top of Tokyos yakuza. The kid brother is a lawyer and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses. The movie takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore pretty violent and tough. Miike has done worse but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard. As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex mostly homosexual in this one. The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie but with a great drive and true grittiness. If you've only seen Miikes far-out movies (Ichi the killer Fudoh etc.) this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over-the-top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy. And as always with Miike there are at least two scenes in this that you'll NEVER forget (see it and figure out which ones for yourself). 8/10 ",positive
" Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy concerns a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O' Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party ending up at the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy. Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. The obvious ends up happening as he moves in. Man about the house was a pre-cursor to Cooke and Mortimer's spin off show George and Mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to Jo Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with Mildred (the late and much missed Yootha Joyce) in particular getting some of the best lines of the series. A semi-regular character was Larry (Doug Fisher) a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something (and never to return it). The American's did a version called three's company but it doesn't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original. Thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script. What a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard. This programme is available on network DVD ",positive
" Police Story is a stunning series of set pieces for Jackie Chan to show his unique talents and bravery. Some of the stunts here are among Jackie's best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably Jackie's greatest single fight sequence more brutal and less comedic then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact. But unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements. I always prefer JC in films such as Project A where his natural comic talents shine through. In the serious confines of some elements of Police Story it just doesn't work for me. Having said that though this is still up there with Jackies best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle. As usual with Hong Kong films avoid the English dubbed DVD version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles. Great stunts OK movie a fine starting point if you've not seen a JC movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7/10 ",positive
" Scoop *** out of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director but I enjoyed Match Point. It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen. It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it. Scoop is Woody Allen's latest film and though he appears in this one it's OK. It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together. Johansson plays Sondra Pransky a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken. One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe with the scoop of a life time travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra during a magic act. Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box she gets the visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case. This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to Match Point and yet it all works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humor fits perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman the suspected serial killer. This is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself. I say give it a chance because you just might like it. ",positive
" The first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians. The 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources. It has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement. It depicts a space gun/launcher and a helicopter along with inventive mass communication devices elevators flat screen panels and wireless intercoms. It's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future. But it portrays a child-like vision of boundless scientific/technological investigation. To me it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a Spinozean-like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government. The pro-progress characters (such as the two Cabals) believe humanity could 'live forever' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants. Arthur C. Clarke (author of 2001: A Space Odyssey) suggested this film to Stanley Kubrick as an example of an excellent SF movie. Kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on Clarke's suggestions (source: Clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel). Though the late Clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best SF movies. It has a beautiful Menzies art design but mediocre special effects (esp. the toy tanks). I personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity. It is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time. It also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress. It seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster. But it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths. It challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness: CABAL: Too much {rest} and too soon and we call it death. But for MAN no rest and no ending. He must go on--conquest beyond conquest. This little planet and its winds and ways and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. Then the planets about him and at last out across immensity to the stars. And when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time--still he will be beginning. CABAL: If we are no more than animals--we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass mattering no more--than all the other animals do--or have done. {He points out at the stars.} It is that--or this? All the universe--or nothingness... (quotes from screenplay). If this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress then the council members (of the world government) will seem like technocrats. But actually those technocrats allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely and they would have to be suppressed by government bans laws against science and experiment and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants. In fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council's developments of science and technology so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council's freedom to experiment. The progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though only preparing its 'peace gas' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress. So it's also a story about the freedom to do science just as much as it's about the wonders of progress. Many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises except in cases of social bias (many want to ban cloning for example) or naturalism (some don't want us to progress freely and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth) or fear/reason (some believe we aren't ready for advanced science/technology since we might destroy ourselves). But Cabal (the president of the council) has an answer to the problem of danger: Our {scientific} revolution did not abolish death or danger. It simply made death and danger worth while (screenplay).

" Zombie Chronicles isn't something to shout about it's obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining B-movie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick. The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that's what makes it more entertaining the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale. Zombie Chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget B-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out Zombie Chronicles. ",positive
" Sure the history in this movie was Hollywoodized --but it's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses. Lafitte sided with the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore hated the British not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over New Orleans only a short time ago; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling which caused his sailing to Galveston; he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero *or* a swashbuckler. But who cares? This is one movie that's sheer entertainment--and face it we all wanted Jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor. Brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance. ",positive
" Pecker is a hilariously funny yet twisted film about a small town in Baltimore whose daily humdrum routine is broken by Pecker a young photographer who takes pictures of real things. No pretty models no gorgeous men just hard living. This wonderful film pokes fun at the plasticness of the urban art chain. There is one particular scene when a homeless woman who shops at Pecker's mom's thrift shop buys the same exact coat as one of the Whitney art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have you might not always have taste. Yet again John Waters sends you into a never-ending spiral of laughter and raw reality. You can have your mainstream Hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities but give me a Pecker or a Hairspray (another excellent John Waters film) over a Titanic or a Godzilla anyday!!

" The brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary. It's one of man's primal fears. This movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who I guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it's not really working out. In a particularly gory scene we find so-so actor Earl Boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot which I guess is the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist. It's a typical Brian Yuzna situation not well written but there's gore. The plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey it's a killer dentist movie we've all thought of it but they did it first. ",positive

" Once upon a time in a castle...... Two little girls are playing in the garden's castle. They are sisters. A blonde little girl (Kitty) and a brunette one (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kitty's doll. Kitty pursues Evelyn. Running through long corridors they reach the room where their grandfather sitting on an armchair reads the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn while Evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to say repeatedly: I am the red lady and Kitty is the black lady . Suddenly Evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs Kitty's doll and then cuts her (the doll's) head. A fight ensues. And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided. Later on their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red: A long time ago a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle. They were sisters and hated each other. One night for jealousy reasons the black lady entered the red lady's room and stabbed her seven times. One year later the red lady left her grave. She killed six innocent people and her seventh victim was the black lady. Once every hundred years the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself. The grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend sixteen years from now the red queen should come again and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend. Sixteen years pass..... This is the very beginning of the film. There are many twists and surprises in the film. It's better for you to forget about logic (if you really analyse it the story doesn't make sense) and just follow the film with its wonderful colors the gorgeous women the clothes the tasteful decor the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack. Enjoy Barbara Bouchet Sybil Danning Marina Malfatti Pia Giancaro among other goddesses. There's a nude by Sybil Danning lying on a sofa that's something to dream about. And don't forget: The lady in red kills seven times! If you've liked La Dama Rossa... check out also La Notte che Evelyn uscì dalla Tomba . ",positive
" wow! this is a good movie! The acting wasn't good at all but if you look at some moments in the film rewind and watch it again it is genius! The man in the begin of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. WOW!I never expected that. Then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. I bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later. And the genius quotes: ''nice shades i need a pair'' ''their yours.. if you think you can take them..''.. just Brilliant! And the fighting is the best i've seen in a while. Look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table. WHAT A HIT! And in the middle of the film one guy in a car shot one time then 3 guys fall he is really good at aiming. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant it was so exciting that james cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves. Jason Peters falls down and roll over again while he is dead! I can't say with more words how great this movie is! ",positive
" I completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. For instance the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could Hollywood just throw in a token gay character in the movie. And besides there was two gay characters and I thought they reflected each other great. One was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters. For instance when she and Adam went to look at the car that Sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible. But I guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad. But if you're more open-minded and I don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film. ",positive
" Warning! Spoilers ahead! SPOILERS I've seen movie in German so it might be that I missed some clues. Despite some weakness in the plot it's a movie that came through to me. I liked especially Lexa Doig's acting. Sometimes I got impression that she *is* Camille. But I can't stop wondering what happened at the end with Bob Cassie and baby. I belive she after initially being set on Bob eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him. Otherwise it's a bit strange that she would carry his baby and love it. It's up to viewer to decide - and I don't like such endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever Eric Roberts .. well I've seen him better but also worse. I believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story. Bottom line is I liked it very much. ",positive
" This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In reality perhaps they are. After all the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film somebody is trying to kill him. There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the film in feeling. The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series. ",positive
" Tremendous black--and-white nighttime cinematography and plenty of it highlights this supposedly-true life account of a 1950s murder in Kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men. The story was written by Truman Capote so you get the very Liberal anti-death penalty message at the end of the film which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family. Despite the annoying slant at the end this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating. Famed photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this. It makes me wish more modern-day films were made in black-and-white. See it on DVD. Blake Wilson John Forsythe Jeff Corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here. My third viewing of this film came in early April of 2005 shortly after Blake in real life was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife. One can't help but look at Blake and this film differently after that. ",positive
" This 1939 film from director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln his trials (literally) and his tribulations. It's a sentimental film reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking. The casting of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems a mistake for while the actor had the right doleful qualities for the part even with several inches of makeup and a false nose he's way too handsome for Honest Abe who was famously homely. It's a good try from Fonda who's nothing if not sincere but his miscasting throws the entire film off. The supporting cast is excellent though and includes Alice Brady Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverential in his treatment of Lincoln who is presented as just shy of a saint and in the final scene the movie goes way over the top. ",positive
" It's beyond my comprehension that so much rubbish from Norway has been remastered for DVD release and still gems like this don't get a shot at recapturing their past glory. I give this a 7 not because it is very good but because it is one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing less than a film-historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first Alien film. And my word Blindpassasjer was first! Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew see the mini-series? However unlikely the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar. Okay the budget is _much_ lower in the Norwegian film but given that it's a really well-done piece of work from the desolate age of Norwegian movie-making which incidentally lasted until the 90s.

" Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this movie. I saw this movie 6 times and I still am not tired of it. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all of Paul Verhoeven's Dutch films. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I have seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls. My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree. I think all of his films are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies which include Total Recall Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable. ",positive
" This is by far my favorite film of all time. That's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. However I don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. The other cast members do a fine job as well. Have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a mainstream movie like Love Crimes . Sadly even though this movie is only 11 years old it could probably not be made today. ",positive

" What a delightful romp  a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack. Einstein is brilliantly acted by Walter Matthau while Meg Ryan's Catherine is unforgettable  better than I have seen her in those films opposite Tom Hanks  as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized. You don't need to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through Ed's (Tim Robbins) mind in pursuing his true love. There's universal appeal in these emotions even if I.Q. keeps it all light fun and tied up nicely. Sure it's not heavy but if you look there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritualist; his sayings such as something along the lines of 'If it is not impossible then why do it?' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one's immediate grasp. In this film there are questions of what an accident really is  such as whether Albert and his whacky sidekicks' intervention in prying Catherine away from stiff-upper-lip loveless James (Stephen Fry  who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling) counts. How much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see and comes across as serendipitous? And of course we'd like to think in real life despite what we often observe of the people we know that we Edwards get the Catherines and Jameses have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins. How nice to know that it might work out in I.Q.'s innocent (and disturbingly exclusively Caucasian) Eisenhower-era land of make-believe. ",positive
" IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest-thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as Cupid's helpers. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light-hearted yet thoughtful movie. You don't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love but at other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space/time of our age. The end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein Meg Ryan creates a quirky scatter-brained mathematician and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science. All together they create a farcical trip through love and science mind and heart. ",positive
" Who wouldn't want to go on road trip with Peter Falk? That guy's right eye has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores. Women are going to love it for all the wake-up romance advice for men and men will love it for its spot-on father/son character study--one great little scene after another. And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. Obviously this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. The most fun part though was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falk's special craft. Really delightful. Let's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and folks. ",positive
" GBS wrote his own screen adaptation of this Nobel Prize winning play but didn't live to see it produced (he had won an Oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 play PYGMALION). When Otto Preminger mounted (produced and directed) this production in 1957 seven years after Shaw's death he had noted British author Graham Greene do the adaptation and it was a solid choice. Taking a cue from Shaw's own screenplay Greene uses material from the stage Epilogue to create a framing device to meld the two acts of the play (one early and one late in Joan's story) into a unified and most satisfying whole. Where on stage the shift in tone is buffered with an intermission here it works just as well with a return to KING Charles Balois's bedchamber (where the man Joan put on the throne is dreaming of the events which led to his current situation) and more material from Shaw's Epilogue - the introduction of the shade of John Gielgud's Warwick (the English king maker ). The majority of the language is solid GBS and the performances from stalwart Shauvians (like Felix Aymler's Inquisitor or Harry Andrews' de Stogumber) to relative newcomers (the film established Jean Seberg's career) are first rate. It may jar some only familiar with Richard Widmark's many movie villains to see him playing a frail and somewhat silly Dauphin but the performance - oddly top billed - is professional even if arguably miscast. The symbolism of the opening credits and the director's choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming all serve Shaw and the story well. Go in expecting quality entertainment and you won't be disappointed. ",positive
" You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution it's asleep... I can explain I think!! Well...

" The movie is absolutely silly. But were you expecting a high-brow intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou's acting isn't exactly the most moving thing I've ever seen but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if you're just taking it at surface value? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese eye-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. There's an evil Triad-style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this. A love interest. It's formulaic but really suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you signed on for? Do yourself a favor if you watch it - I found myself a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise but we got a great laugh out of it. They would appear to be extremely fixated on Jerusalem and the numbers 1 10. I laughed I cried I hurled. I'd watch it again. Especially for that fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table - I'd LOVE to play on one of those. Slick enough for me but I dig on trash cinema. ",positive
" Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. She has been described perhaps even unfairly caricatured as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. Rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film. It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by of all peoples generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street. Co-writer von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II. The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance Ruth not only sits shivah (the Jews' week-long mourning ritual) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors. Her American-born daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that she'll disown Hannah if she doesn't give up doting handsome Luis. Stay tuned. A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the Holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed. So Hannah having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. Were she not this would have been a very short film. But Ruth pretending to be a historian locates 90 year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade) now a widow. As the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital. The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use Israel as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add Sarah to their names(incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian's name on its characters list with the false Israel included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation). While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps those married to Aryans were exempted. For a time. Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity. The young Lena tries to locate her husband. All she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women builds up some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them ( Jew-loving whore being one appellation). As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde. Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. The men and a handful of women are released. As in the real story the Nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story). Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly one gathers begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murdered. The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943 a set and the street today in a bustling rebuilt unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes that point very well. The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although the Times's critic appears not to know that). Von Trotta's hand is sure but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive. The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim copy and paste school of Teutonic nastiness. But that's understandable. The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. THAT'S why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on. The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time. Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. So a ray of light it was and von Trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists. And always will. 9/10 ",positive
" At the time My Left Foot was the little movie that could. It was hugely popular and everyone applauded the fact that such a small independent film could make it all the way to the Oscars. Since then movies like My Left Foot are a dime a dozen so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about. It's certainly a well made and competent film but it's clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis who immerses himself in the role of Cristy Brown a man living with cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won Dustin Hoffman an Oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in Rain Man and the Academy followed suit by giving Day-Lewis the same honor. The only thing really separating this film from a big budget Hollywood production is just that -- its budget. In every other way it's just as formulaic as any standard product. That's not to say it isn't a good movie but it's not a masterpiece. Grade: A- ",positive
" While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action not animated version) I think it still fell a little short of what Disney could do. It was well-filmed the music was more suited to the action and the effects were better done (compared to 101). The acting was perhaps better but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel and Glenn Close is really not to be missed as in the first movie. She makes it shine. Her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of and they add to the spectacle Disney has given us. This is a great family film with little or no objectionable material and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike. It's bound to be a classic as so many Disney films are. Here's to hoping the third will be even better still- because you know they probably want to make one. ;) ",positive
" This picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser.

After Pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes.

" Upon the first viewing I found this tale to be at least less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales. After many more I think it's one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty bad especially the love song but two things stand out that make the movie even the singing worthwhile. One is the art direction. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales this is a beautifully decorated period piece; every piece of cloth and jewel (both of which have major parts in this movie's plot) look fresh and new and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants. Even during the love song I find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess wonderfully done. The other thing is the comic timing. A lot of the movie is cheesy but the emperor's vanity (and his making fun of himself in the end) the suspicious guard the guard chasing Nicholas and the stupid prince were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose. And the sequence during the song Weave-O makes up for the songs that weren't so good. ",positive
" I was not expecting much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just gotten off of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex. Once seated in the theater tired and frustrated the movie started I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie getting more and more excited with each minute passing. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic. The actors were fabulous the pace was perfect and the ending was magical. ",positive
" Saw this on cable back in the early 90's and loved it. Never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently. Still find it a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why its not higher rated. I found everything about this film compelling. As a vet (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in Iraq. I wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see. The human toll on our soldiers isn't left on the battlefield. Its brought home for the rest of there lives. And this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way. Excellent film.

Morgan Sheppard Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) quits her TV show and heads to the small Christian town Fallwell Massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt's inheritance hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in Vegas. Unfortunately for her all she gets is a creepy old house a poodle and a magic cookbook. While in Fallwell Elvira tries to make money breathe some life into the teenagers win the heart of a stud (Daniel Greene) avoid being burned at the stake and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who is planning to use the book to end the world. my thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful beautiful and funny woman and as Elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. In this movie her charms are put to good use. I loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film. You got Elvira with her low-cut black dress her big black hair and her enormous 'twins' and she's in a Christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) a lot more entertaining. W. Morgan Sheppard is equally great as Elvira's uncle/nemesis Vincent out to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from Elvira. What really makes the film is not the plot but the many jokes. Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel. I hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film and any fan of Roger Corman B-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film. If you love Elvira you will love this flick.

" The filmmaker inhaled Andy Goldsworthy's art his search for closeness with the land and the water and his sense of proportion -- and so gently so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us. Rivers and Tides loves Goldsworthy's work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world a world that hides its power in plain sight. See this movie! ",positive
" This is the last of four swashbucklers from France I've scheduled for viewing during this Christmas season: the others (in order of viewing) were the uninspired THE BLACK TULIP (1964; from the same director as this one but not nearly as good) the surprisingly effective LADY Oscar (1979; which had originated as a Japanese manga!) and the splendid CARTOUCHE (1962). Actually I had watched this one not too long ago on late-night Italian TV and recall not being especially bowled over by it so that I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it this time around (also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming DVD release from Criterion). Incidentally FANFAN LA TULIPE has quite a bit in common with the afore-mentioned CARTOUCHE: not just cast and crew members (producers Georges Dancigers and Alexandre Mnouchkine cinematographer Christian Matras actor Noel Roquevert) but plot-wise as well  in fact the hero is a womanizing soldier (Jean-Paul Belmondo's Cartouche had also had a brief military spell) who's loved by a fiery girl (in this case gypsy Gina Lollobrigida) while he's himself obsessed by an impossible love (here it's none other than the king's daughter)! As in the later film too Fanfan (an ideally cast Gerard Philipe who ironically is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years' time) is flanked by two fun-loving yet cowardly men (one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine's own father) and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks (the ageing Roquevert with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl)!; for the record Lollobrigida will rejoin Philippe in her next film Rene Clair's delightful romantic fantasy LES BELLES DE NUIT (1952). FANFAN proved to be a big box-office hit on its home-ground and even copped a surprising (but well-deserved) Best Direction award at Cannes over more renowned films like AN American IN Paris (1951) DETECTIVE STORY (1951) OTHELLO UMBERTO D. and VIVA ZAPATA! In fact its popularity ensured its re-release in a computer-colored version (presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn't touch a black-and-white product with a ten-foot pole) and the Criterion DVD itself contains a sample from this variant; being obviously a foreign-language title there's also the dubious choice of an English-dubbed soundtrack but even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering when all is said and done there's simply no substitute for the original! FANFAN LA TULIPE (a nickname given the hero by a young Genevieve Page as the celebrated Madame De Pompadour) contains about as much comedy as (the expected) action and romance; while some may find this overwhelming I don't agree myself as I enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and on the whole this combination is comparable with Jerzy Skolimowski's equally droll THE ADVENTURES OF GERARD (1970). That said the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise (particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent) and the film itself rather adult at times (with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout) when viewed back-to-back with vintage Hollywood fare as I did now; the climax then is quite ingenious: the enemy forces (who amusingly are made to speak in speeded-up gibberish!) are depleted by our heroic trio alone much to the king's amazement who as portrayed by Marcel Herrand  best-known for his role of leader of the Parisian underworld in Marcel Carne''s CHILDREN OF PARADISE (1945)  is himself something of a lecher. P.S. An Italian TV channel has been threatening to screen Christian-Jaque's promising CHAMPAGNE FOR SAVAGES (1964) for months now but despite programming it three times already (with a tentative fourth one slated for next week) they have yet to show it; even so I do have three more films of his in my unwatched VHS pile (equally culled from late-night Italian TV screenings): the three-hour epic LA CHARTREUSE DE PARME (1948; also starring Gerard Philippe) THE SECOND TWIN (1967) and THE LEGEND OF FRENCHIE KING (1971; with Brigitte Bardot and Claudia Cardinale).

" For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror strip cartoon viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia. In that context it is wonderful but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters. The plotline is also a bit limp for today's audience but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well. Jane you must remember was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years created to boost the morale of the troops. She gave a double meaning to the strip in strip cartoon. The story has something in common with the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era a bunch of bumbling Nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling Englanders and set in the African jungle of course. For Jane fans a must see. For the rest of you a damp squib. ",positive

" Darius Goes West is the touching story of a brave teen coping with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and his personal quest to see the Pacific Ocean. He receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest. The story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable disease. Anyone who thinks young people are self-centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head. It is the power of the young people and their engagement with Darius' plight that is very compelling in this documentary. ",positive
" Cinderella is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried. Once her father died Cinderella's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters. One day the King sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the Royal Ball in honor of his son to find a wife. Of course Cinderella didn't get to go but her stepsisters did. Cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the Royal Ball until her fairy godmother appeared. So she did some magic and made Cinderella into a beautiful woman but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back. While at the Royal Ball Cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the King orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper. The duke searched every house but finally found the women who it belonged to Cinderella. Clyde Geronimi Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney films in 1950. This film is about a magical fairytale. In the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love. My favorite thing about Cinderella is the music. When Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house so I will never forget it. I also loved the part when Cinderella and the Prince were singing the song So This is Love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love. Overall this film was my favorite film when I was a little child because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale life. ",positive
" This film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid. There is really not much I'd need or want to say here. Except maybe See this film and Enjoy the excellent work by Daniel and Pascal who carries you through this neat funny and heartbreaking story about 'spending your eighth day' - your own day! Seeing this film made me think seriously about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It appears that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do. Either if it's pleasing a career or just consuming TV-shows and ballgames. What we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - make a difference. About taking room and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (on the eighth day)... At least that was what I got from 'The Eighth Day'. ",positive
" When I was very young on a local tv station they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays.I saw lots of Kung Fu movies on weekends.I remember lots of them.I saw great flicks like Crippled Masters Blind Fist of Bruce Kung Fu Zombie Shaolin Drunken Monk Rage of the Master Tattoe Dragon and...Five Deadly Venoms.I remember the day clearly.Me and my dad had just gotten lunch at Burger King.We were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday.We ran in the house and jumped onto the couch turned on the set and flicked it onto 56.The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over it.Then under that was the Title of the film.It said Five Deadly Venoms.Then the movie began.I bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence.I loved this movie the minute it came on.My favorite character was the Toad Venom.The plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn't what lured me...it was the fighting.The fights were so...amazing.I moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended.

" This is an evocative and idealized portrait of the early life of Lincoln(born 1809 Hodgensville-Kentucky- and died in Washington 1865). Ford's excellent movie takes Abraham Lincoln(Fonda) from his youth. He studied laws common law and began practice as lawyer in 1837.This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his log-cabin days initial relationship to Mary Todd(Weaver) following the couple from their first ball and his departure for congress candidate. But focuses mainly on a brothers(Richard Cromwell Eddie Quillan) accused for murder the posterior trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection for their mum(Alice Brady). The Lincoln-Fonda as defender advocate and Donald Meek-prosecutor are nothing short of brilliant. Excellent performance from Henry Fonda as idealistic traveller Springfield solicitor he was to star regularly for Ford from this movie as ¨Grapes of wrath My darling Clementine and Fort Apache¨. Besides sterling acting by Alice Brady as grieved mother she was a great actress from the silent cinema but this one results to be her last movie because she early died from cancer.The Lincoln's deeds developing make for skilfully appealing entertaining.His portrayal shows a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and describes his goodness uprightness and willful. Lincoln like John Ford was a straightforward man who never varied the ideals of his youth.This American masterpiece is correct on both counts as splendid biography and as magnificent drama. Another biographies about Abraham Lincoln are the following: 1) ¨Abraham Lincoln¨(1930) by D.W.Griffith with Walter Huston Una Merkel talking from his birth until his assassination; 2) ¨Abe Lincoln in Illinois¨(1940)by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey Ruth Gordon concerning similar events to Ford's film through his career as lawyer 3)TV version titled ¨Gore Vidal's Lincoln¨ with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd.

Arthur Askey with his side kick Stinker Murdoch entertain you and I suspect the cast to a high octane thrills and spills espionage thriller.It's set in old rural England during the second world war. It centres around a motley group of people that need to stay overnight through circumstances outside any ones' control in an old railway waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train. The plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit to the entire cast it is humorous in parts and at times genuinely scary! (The tale was written by that old boy Godfrey of Dads Army fame and it is clever ) Arthur Askey is entertaining and is very at home preforming his routines to you and the cast he also shows he can act a bit! The cast are never out staged though even the railway porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas. Oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish washer! ",positive
" Zu:The warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic! You never would have guessed it was made in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (He continued doing this in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.) Even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. Legend of Zu is connected to Zu warriors from magic mountain ! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. The plot is a bit hard to follow. But to be honest it doesn't matter. It is all about the action and adventure! I always was wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI. Now we know he made this movie. Maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I am not going to be critical about that. There is so much happening on the screen you simply won't believe! I think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in Holland. Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! This movie easily can beat big budget Hollywood productions like Superman Returns or Xmen 3. The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humor! In most of Tsui Harks's movies he combines drama fantasy martial arts and humor. Somehow it is missing in this movie. Again I am not going to be picky about these small matters. Legend of Zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. A true classic! ",positive
" Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears rather than meeting them later. However I have no problems with that preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are adorable and it's fun watching them play and grow. My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed. 9/10 ",positive
" One of John Ford's best films 'The Informer' doesn't feature any grand scenery of the American West. Instead the intense drama Ford was known for plays out on the no less rugged terrain of British character actor Victor McLaglen's face. The former prizefighter who once faced Joe Louis in the ring delivers an Academy Award-winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. The plot is gracefully simple: In 1922 Dublin a starving and humiliated man who's been thrown out of the IRA for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood himself becomes an informant. For £20 he betrays a friend to the Tans and for the rest of the night he drinks and gives away his blood money in rapidly alternating spasms of guilt denial self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions. It is the remarkable complexity given to the character of the seemingly simple Gypo that is the film's most impressive achievement. In most movies a burly lout of Gypo's type would be cast as the heavy he'd have at best two or three lines and be disposed of quickly so the hero and the villain could have their showdown. In 'The Informer' Gypo himself is both hero and villain while the showdown is in his inner turmoil every bit of which is explicitly shared with the audience. Because Liam O'Flaherty's novel had previously been filmed in 1929 RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his associates particularly cinematographer Joseph H. August turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar 'The Informer' also won John Ford his first along with wins for Best Screenplay and Best Score. ",positive
" Simply one of the best ever! Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (that should have won an Oscar) a haunting Quincy Jones score and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly-matched killers. This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasn't even nominated for Best Picture while Dr. Doolittle was. Go Figure! Although you don't get to know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake a close second. Highly recommended! ",positive

" Currently on METOO's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays right after Maverick and right before Wild Wild West (followed by Star Trek ). Don't know if I ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on but I'm really captivated by it. Offbeat unusual surreal stories set in a mythical West. Kind of the Naked City of Westerns. And the guest stars are there: Dan Duryea Lyle Bettger Brian Donlevy MacDonald Carey Rick Jason (as a treacherous Mexican) a young Dick Van Patten Jack Lord Noah Berry Jr. (as a colorful Mexican) Martha Hyer Marguerite Chapman even Ann Robinson ( War of the Worlds ) Gloria Talbott ( I Married a Monster from Outer Space ) It ran for EIGHT SEASONS over 200 episodes from January 1959 to December 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss Gil Favor the most stolid man that's ever lived with the code of honor of a Samurai and just the right balance between toughness and open-handedness. I would vote for him for President any day. (P.S. He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/ ) And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand Rowdy Yates. Also veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal One-eyed One-horned Flying Purple People Eater ) Sheb Wooley is there as seasoned scout Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as Wishbone . And then there's that great theme song performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the Maverick theme I've got Western theme songs running through my head all day.) I look forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention a moo-ving experience) is always guaranteed as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial. Rollin' rollin' rollin' . . .  ",positive
" A DOUBLE LIFE has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons: the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role (here Othello) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award (as well as the Golden Globe) as best actor. Let's take the second point first. Is Anthony John Colman's greatest role or even his signature role? I have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles. Most of his career Ronald Colman played decent gentlemen frequently in dangerous or atypical situations. He is Bulldog Drummond (cleaned up in the Goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist) fighting crime. He is Raffles the great cricket player and even greater burglar trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friend's honor. He is Robert Conway the great imperial political figure who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth Shangri-La. He is Dick Heldar manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist. I can add Sidney Carton and Rudolf Rassendyll to this list. But here he is not heroic. In fact he is unconsciously villainous - he murders one person and nearly kills two others. It does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill - his behavior here is anti-social. To me Colman should have gotten the Oscar for Heldar or Carton or Conway - all more typical of his acting roles. But the Academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding it's treasure to it's leading members. Colman's Anthony John is a very good performance and at one point truly scary. When alone with Signe Hasso in her home she at the top of a staircase and him at the base they have an argument. She demands that Tony leave saying she won't see him. He stares at her his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before and he says Oh no you won't! He starts moving upstairs frightening Hasso and she runs into her room. He stops himself and leaves. It actually is the real highpoint of his performance - even more than his assaulting of Hasso on stage or of Edmond O'Brien or his killing of Shelley Winters. It showed his blind fury. For that moment it was (to me) an Oscar-worthy performance. But it is only that moment. I'm glad he was recognized for the role but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance. His actual performance in the Shakespearian role of Othello is not great but bearable. Too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style (one wonders if that was due to the coaching of Walter Hampden who probably knew how to handle the role properly or a reaction to it). Nowadays Othello is played by an African American actor more frequently than a white one. Paul Robeson's brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place. But the three best known movie performances of the part are those of Colman Orson Welles in his movie of OTHELLO and Laurence Olivier in his movie of his play production of OTHELLO. All three white actors did the role in black face. My personal favorite of the three is Welles who seems the most subtle. But even watching Welles' fine film version makes me angry that Robeson never got to put his performance (with Jose Ferrer as Iago) on film. Now the first question - can an actor get that wrapped up in a role? I heard different things about this. Some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set. Others have found a role they have to be stimulating influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life. But actually I have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role. It seems a melodramatic hackneyed idea. As a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with Cukor Kanin and Gordon. In 1944 a B feature THE BRIGHTON STRANGLER starring John Loder had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous Jack the Ripper type and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind. There was an earlier movie in the 1930s in which an actor playing Othello gets jealous of his wife (I think the title was MEN ARE NOT GODS but I'm not sure). But due to Colman's name and career and Cukor's directing it is A DOUBLE LIFE that people think of when they recall this plot idea. It even reached comedy (finally) on an episode of CHEERS where Diane Chambers is helping an ex-convict who may have acting talent and they put on OTHELLO at the bar just after he sees her with Sam Malone kissing. Only Diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex-convict and can't delay the production long enough (she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play). The cast of A DOUBLE LIFE was first rate and Cukor's direction was as sure as ever. So the film is definitely worth watching. But despite giving Colman an interestingly different role it was not his best work on the screen. ",positive
" The emotional impact of this movie defies words. It is elegant subtle beautiful and tragic all rolled into two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures into his acting ability the full range of it. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought this must be a fluke for the blockbuster over-the-top actor Smith. His performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to Smith a refinement of talent the selectivity of scripts I'm not sure but I view him differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief. Don't watch it for the plot watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt atonement love and sacrifice. ",positive
" I started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning I was pretty skeptical about it. Original movie was kind of childish and I was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the BSG new season. But after few episodes I became a fan. I've loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is Jack O'Neill the not-only-smart Samantha Carter the glorious Teal'c women and kids favorite and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. Of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting - it's about helping your friend even risking your life for him. It's about we don't leave anybody behind . Struggling to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will and all good qualities that makes a human - Human. And now it's breaking a record going 10th season and still doing good. ",positive

" WHEN I first saw this film in London in 1958 I was bowled over. I had never seen a film like this before. It had a strange hypnotic effect quite unlike the films that I had seen previously and it left a lasting impact. I believe that Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters if not twins. Certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer. If this has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language I would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased. ",positive
" I liked it... just that... i liked it not like the animated series... i love it!!!. The fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate but this cartoon was awesome but it really didn't like it that much. There's too much people talking about Bruce being so cold but if this is around 5 years later anybody in a crime-fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude so to me it isn't a flaw. Batgirl was awesome she really fit there as there isn't more Dick Grayson as a robin batman needed a good teammate not like the new robin he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child. But heres what didn't work: The new artwork... it isn't horrible but... to me it does'nt work in a series like batman. This is a dark character with a maniac killer like the joker so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon The joker isn't a bad design but i still like the past joker (but to me the BEST joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond:return of the joker) so this joker isn't near as good. The good thing about the joker is that it still mark Hamil voice. My favorite character: Harley Quinn (im in love for her) They put an awesome episode for her: Mad love (to me the best episode of this series). Here we finally know how she turned Harley Quinn and how the joker twisted her mind and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series darker no happy ending brutal fight with the joker (but too short) this is how it was to be ALL the series. BUT in general i didn't like how she made Harley in this series... in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way she get punched she say nonsenses she make flaws... c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her not from her... and here they put ridiculous (like i said the only episode where i don't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper) So in general its a good series it has it upsides and downs the drawn could be better ( MY GOOD!!! KILL THAT CATWOMAN!!!!) nice sound effects nice music nice voices and nice episodes: my favorites Mad love Jokers millions Old Wounds Sins of the father and Cold comfort. If you enjoyed Batman:TAS you can watch this but don't spec too much in the other hand if you didn't watched TAS watch this first and then watch TAS in that way you're really gonna love TAS :D ",positive

" An independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume. Enter Broken and aggressively promoted twenty minute short with style and enthusiams to spare. But is it any good as a film or does it only work as a demo piece? Ah there in lies the rub. Broken is the story of Bonnie Clayton who is abducted after awakening from a reoccurring nightmare one night by a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage (quote from the video box). As she's held captive it becomes obvious that her abductors know things about her that even she didn't know about herself. While they question her a black-clad soldier guns his way into their hideout in an attempt to rescue her. Mayhem ensues. Fortunately for us director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he's doing or at least he's very good at faking it. Broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair which is especially commendable considering its budget and the inexperience of all involved. What it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets The Matrix written ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer/writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display. Does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators? No not really. Though it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length. Broken is no genre classic. The biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a full-length feature. The final twist doesn't get enough build up time to be shocking. If Ferrari were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed plot elements would seem less random and the film more complete. Here's to knowing he's getting the chance. Audio Broken's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation is second to none in the indie world. I've never heard such aggressive surround from such a small feature. The Matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep gunshots have punch and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects. Of everything presented on this disc it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent DVD production. Also included is an equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround track which is the menu default. Extras There are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc. There are so many extras in fact that I find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here while still expecting my readers to continue reading. Whatever shortcomings the actual short may have the DVD is unprecedented in its informational resources. People who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production including everything from the conceptual art to the promotional campaign. Those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these features. The extras are broken down into categorical menus. These include: pre-production production post-production after the short and cast and crew bios. From a critical standpoint I found that some of the sections were quite short. Had they been edited into one featurette per menu option they would've been less frustrating to navigate as the curser defaults to the top selection with every return to the main section menu. This is of course just nitpicking but perhaps for future DVD releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heart. It has six audio commentaries and hours of interview footage and talented people and despite the consonant salesmanship their true colours do shine through. The willingness to share their film-making secrets with anyone who picks up this DVD is quite generous. From the extras I learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price even where to get cheap air soft weaponry. On top of this I was given several alternate options in case I found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production. Wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this DVD. Overall I've scored the actual short as a 6 out of 10 but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort because I'd have scored it an 8 or 9 in these fields. I recommend the DVD for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand American dollars. Those who purchase the DVD can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project as the more attention these guys get the more funding the feature-length version will get. ",positive
" There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie but can't really do that can I? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit laugh cry and then pee. I'm serious. Don't watch this movie if you're easily offended by profanity sex nudity homosexuality...and everything else associated with nature. Being a woman and that might not even be a factor I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all their other debuts I think Baseketball is the prize winner. I'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie!! That's all I'm going to say. It's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people like Ozzy Osbourne who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak. So I'm keeping it professional. Best movie. Heck yeah!! ",positive
" I'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a fictional state but obviously it deals with the murder of Kennedy. A truthful and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man Daslow (=Oswald) and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team. The screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end. Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authorities is (though not uninteresting) a bit out of place. The ending sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I have ever seen in a movie. ",positive
" Of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film. From that point of view it is utter fantasy. But who cares? It is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with Citizen Kane Battleship Potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching. Films like this are worth a hundred Citizen Kanes.It is about what cinema does best: great camera-work great settings and great performances. The three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented keeping the best till last. I will gladly watch this film again and again and again and... ",positive
" Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological story for that matter) this in my opinion is the best of them all. Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions e.g. the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes Odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece not some Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B-flick. Notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the Odyssey at hand). At least I did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the movie even more. ",positive
" Twelve Monkeys is odd and disturbing yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. It cleverly jumps between future and the past and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole a convict who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible dealing with and between reason and madness the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films. The story is just fantastic. It's so original and so entertaining. The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named La Jetée (1962) which I haven't seen but I must thank the director and writer of the movie Chris Marker for giving such an inspiration for the writers of Twelve Monkeys . I read a little about La Jetée it's not the same story but it has the same idea so this is not just a copy of it. David and Janet Peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. The music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling composed by Paul Buckmaster. Terry Gilliam who we remember from Monty Python as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me as I really never thought him as a director type of a person. I know he has directed movies before but I really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. It shouldn't be a surprise though as he does an amazing job. You can still sense that same weirdness as in the Python's but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. Yes it is indeed odd weird bizarre and disturbing so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. It's not as heavy as you could imagine but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. Despite that the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks dreams jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part though it does need concentration from the viewer after all. What comes to acting well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. The role of James Cole is played by the mighty Bruce Willis who probably does his best role performance yet to date. Now people may disagree with me as he did some fine job in for example The Sixth Sense as well but for me the role of James Cole was so ideal for Willis and he performs it incredibly well. The character is very well written too yet performed even better. Cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself starting to question his actual time of living trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. By hardship he starts to loose his faith questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. Other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of Madeleine Stow and Brad Pitt. Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly the psychiatrist of James Cole who sees something strangely familiar in Cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. She somehow starts to believe Cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. Brad Pitt is so good in the role of Jeffrey Goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. The insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought Pitt even an Oscar nomination for it so I guess I'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing. All in all Twelve Monkeys is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances especially from Willis and Pitt and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. It's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures I've ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really but that's how it is it's mind blowing. ",positive
" Some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracing it's roots back to Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice in the 40's - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90's. Nick Cage plays the down on his luck main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people town violence and threat of Red Rock West. Lots of twists and turns great performances by Cage Hopper and Walsh an hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop and seamless directing make this a real joy. Favorite Line: When Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get-away car shakes his head and says: F***in' story of my life.  ",positive
" Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is the Fourth series in the continuing Gundam chronicles. Unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars this one is a little different; instead of having an army-vs.-army situation this one is led by five teenage boys (due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults) and their machines called Gundams because of the metal alloy used in their construction. Which leads to problems since gundams are supposed to be destroyed replaced by Mobile Suits which are piloted less-destructive weapon platforms and Dolls which are ran on A.I. and are used as grunt infantry. The whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives Gundam Wing an edge over a greater portion of the Anime that makes it's way here. Especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines such as Naruto DragonBall One Piece DragonBall Z and InuYasha which are all from Shonen Jump which is now available in America. Mobile Suit Gundam Wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of over-the-top battles between mortals who more resemble gods Gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully. Normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a small battle is to have it take a half-hour - something that would never happen in real life. Gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die machines will be destroyed and rebuilt battles will be lost and won and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical. But the magic of Gundam Wing is in the details and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having. Emotion. Instead of mythic prophecies magic or overblown martial arts Gundam Wing is hard-line science fiction from a country that hates hard-line science fiction. (NOTE: The author would like to state that Neon Genesis Evangelion is not hard-line-plausible-in-real-life science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series) they love Star Wars but hate A.I. (the movie). Henceforth why Gundam Wing was and Gundam SeeD is now in production for both Japanese and U.S. releases at the same time with two voice teams. American audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the Japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited SeeD episodes that air on Cartoon Network. The emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards. The heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of Earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing. This is not war this is total war . Every person every building every street is a target for attack both on Earth and off. My only complaint and the reason it didn't get the score of ten is that at about three-fourths of the way through it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes and no one really seems to change. Kind of like a present-time flashback which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between Project: Meteor and OZ. But the final two episodes and the overplayed-on-Cartoon-Network (back in 2001-2003) Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz movie more than make up for the slack. ",positive
" This amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in Cameroun's judicial system-- policewomen lawyers and judges. Despite tremendous difficulties-- lack of means the desperate poverty of the people multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious/ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants-- these brave strong women are making a difference. This is a rare thing-- a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind. Despite the atrocities we see in the movie justice does get served thanks to these passionate hardworking women. I only hope this film gets a wide release in the United States. The more people who see this film the better. ",positive

" till HBO began rerunning it this month. I remember laughing out loud in the theater back in 1991 and now again in my living room. If I see that it's on I have to watch it. There's just no question. This is so much more entertaining to me than other more popular spoofs like Airplane! (which I really like BTW). Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion. Quotes like Sudden speech! The last symptoms of brain fever! She could blow at any moment! put me over the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg hasn't been this funny since 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'. Kevin Klein Sally Field Robert Downey Jr. all turn in superb performances as expected. I started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars but then I realized that for the type of film it's supposed to be there isn't one thing I'd change or improve upon. So 10 it is. I have to get this on DVD that's just all there is to it. ",positive
" I love this episode of Columbo. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is delicious to watch as the perky lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident. She blames her niece's husband the nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her. I would have loved somebody else than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I never really like Hartley in anything personally. And of course with Columbo there are some laughs like when he questions Veronica at a belly-dancing class. Ruth's Abigail is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with Columbo always played wonderfully by Peter Falk. ",positive
" I never saw it on TV but rented the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found that it was available. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. It's funny and the animation is excellent. That level of quality I would only have expected from feature films so I'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it. Maybe the DVD release had improved animation? One bonus to the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I'm an adult and I really appreciate that it is for adults. It isn't only kids who like cute animated characters. It is nowhere near raunchy as some have claimed but I can see where some parents wouldn't want their young children to see it. I'm very disappointed that it was cancelled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or perhaps a movie. ",positive
" From the start I knew I would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life. The idea of two giant robots manned by brilliant humans fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot I have ever experienced. I can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script. Let's just just say it compares to both Lord of Rings pictures combined. The Academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that is.....ROBOT JOX. ",positive
" I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of the cinematic form his film have been sometimes in my opinion overlooked. But this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in.\ All the wonderful characters that existed the lifestyle the mode of dress the way they spoke OK they might be exaggerated but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts. I just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact. Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I have only seen it on TV. But for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one. ",positive
" All Kira Reed fans MUST see this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas. She's also getting over a divorce. However she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). They go into a corner room and they do it. Thankfully Kira gets a condom out (Now don't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. Remember kids safe sex). Later she marvels to her publishist how great it was but she didn't get his name. Despite this the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. But eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. When she does all hell breaks loose and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the best of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Check this out and marvel at the greatness of Kira. ",positive
" I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue which please remember is all tongue in cheek. Aussies and Poms will understand everyone else-well? (title song lyric) he can sink a beer he can pick a queer in his latest double-breasted Bondi gear. (another song lyric) All pommies are bastards bastards or worse and England is the a**e-hole of the universe. (during a television interview on an arty program ): Mr Mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you've been in England? (Barry's response)Flamin' bull-artists! (while chatting up a naive young pom girl): Mr Mackenzie I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants back in Australia? (Barry's response) Abos? I've never seen an Abo in me life. Mum does most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) round our place. This is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser Aussie flick. If you can get a copy of it watch and enjoy. ",positive
" Canto 1: How Kriemhild Mourned Over Siegfried and How King Attila Woos her Through his Ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlarn: Kriemhild (Margarete Schön) insists on having the head of the killer of her beloved husband Hagen Tronje (Hans Adalbert Schlettow) but her brother King Gunther (Theodor Loos) refuses her request. When King Attila of the Huns woos Kriemhild through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlar she makes him promise through oath in the name of his king that no man would ever offend her. Hagen Tronje hides the Nibelungen treasure in the bottom of a lake. Canto 2: How Kriemhild Takes Leave from her Homeland and How She Was Received by King Attila: Kriemhild brings some earth from where Siegfried died and travels to the court of the Huns where she is welcomed by Attila himself who also promises through oath to defend her. Canto 3: How King Attila Besieged Rome and How Kriemhild Summoned her Brothers: When Kriemhild delivers a baby boy Attila returns to his realm and asks Kriemhild what she would like most to please her. She asks him to invite her brothers to come to his kingdom. Canto 4: How Kriemhild Receives her Brothers: Kriemhild insists on having the head of Hagen Tronje but her brothers keep loyalty to their friend and again do not accept her request. Canto 5: How the Huns Celebrated the Summer Solstice With the Nibelungen: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje but he refuses since in accordance with the laws of the desert a guest is considered sacred. Kriemhild offers gold to the Hums for the head of Hagen Tronje. There is a fight and Hagen Tronje kills Attila's son. Canto 6: The Nibelungen's Distress: The Huns lose the battle against the Nibelungen but keep them under siege inside Attila's castle. Kriemhild promises to spare their lives provided they deliver Hagen Tronje but her brother Gunther tells that German people are loyal with their friends. Canto 7: The Nibelungen's End: After the death of Rüdiger von Bechlarn Giselher and Gernot Hagen Tronje and Guhther are finally captured. Kriemhild kills Hagen Tronje ending her revenge with the destruction of the Nibelungen. The conclusion of the poetic saga of Siegfried through Kriemhild's Revenge is also told through seven dramatic cantos. The nature of the first part is a magnificent tale of fantasy adventure romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hate revenge and loyalty. The solid screenplay with a perfect development of the characters the excellent performances of the cast and the awesome direction of Fritz Lang produced another epic ahead of time. Margarete Schön is impressive with a total different woman obsessed and inflexible in her revenge wish. The costumes that Kriemhild wears are also very impressive and her acting is based on her face and look. I was a little disappointed with the reaction of Attila after the death of his only son since I found it too passive. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): Os Nibelungos  Parte II: A Vingança de Kriemshild ( The Nibelungen Part II: Kriemhild's Revenge ) ",positive
" What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude? The Sopranos has literally redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless the writing directing and for me most of all the acting. Watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don't watch the show because it's violent it's not all about the violence it's about business family and many deeper things that all depend on what you as a fan see. For me I don't like when people refer to the show a show about the Mafia. For me it's a show about family. A family who through generations happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting magnificent story lines from brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence and dares to be different. ",positive
" Eddie Izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius and this is Eddie at his very best. His material is extremely witty and hilarious and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage. Instead of insulting the audience's intelligence he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences Hitler the moon landing and the British. With so many memorable laughs one can't help but repeat some of his lines. Forever more Do you have a flag? should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine. Every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see Dress to Kill . By far the best British standup comedian I've ever witnessed Eddie Izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage. However his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is. Dress to Kill is a treasure one that luckily has found its way to home video and can and should be enjoyed again and again. ",positive
" Wow. Uhm...well...wow! I guess I'll start with the plot. A betrothed woman (Lucy) arrives at the family home of her would be husband (Mathurin) in France where they are awaiting the arrival of the Bishop or Cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy a will.) While waiting young Lucy learns about a legend of a Beast who roamed the grounds centuries before. In bed that night she begins fantasizing about the Beast and his rape-turned-consensual tryst with the former lady of the house. That's where it gets interesting! The plot is really pretty thin (and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick) but the filmmaker rewards (?) those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale. This movie isn't for everyone. If you're looking for great cinema look elsewhere. If you're looking for a far-out movie about bestiality (that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject) this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach don't be afraid of this one. Outside of some horse-on-horse action at the beginning the 'deeds' are pretty cartoonish IMO) ",positive
" This drama is unlike Sex and the City where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other. Its much more personal and people can relate to it. Its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like Sex and the City Lipstick Jungle.... Dr. Katie Roden is a psychologist with a dark secret she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends. She is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her. Her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well. Trudi Malloy a widow is battling issues with letting go of her dead husband from 9/11. And when a handsome stranger Richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business. The ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between Richard and Trudi are totally funny! It is interesting to note that Richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9/11 board for her husband's death..lets see what his intentions are Siobhan Dillon a lawyer is fed up of her husband's love making tactics which only involve baby making (as they are having trouble conceiving) and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his services a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long!It will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband (played by Raza Jeffrey) Jessica a real estate business woman is single and is straight until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them. Her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a married man her colleague. Lets see where her character venture to.... The beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown. Its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be safe ! ",positive
" Great documentary about the lives of NY firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time.. That reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item.. What shocked me was not only the attacks but the High Fat Diet and physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think a lot of Doctors would agree with me that in the physical shape they were in some of these firefighters would NOT of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear. Having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job.

" I enjoyed this movie. Haven't seen Andy Griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly. I've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he's versatile. I wasn't troubled that Dotty's anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of whatever-phobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly a sensitive with extra-sensory powers as was understood by the local Indians but not by any Anglos. It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. Although this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems. Also Hiram's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle. It's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance. ",positive
" Cinderella is one of the most beloved of all Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy-tale as told by Charles Perrault the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella a good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters. When a royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited (read: the King wants to get the Prince to marry) Cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her. But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand... The story of Cinderella on its own wouldn't be able to pad out a feature so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the Fairy Godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become Cinderella's true sidekicks. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks and their own nemesis being the stepmother's cat Lucifer. Their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy-tale plot and are for the most part wonderful. Admittedly the film does slow down a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball but after this slowdown the film really gets going again and surprisingly (since Cinderella is the most worn down story of all time probably) ends up as one of the most involving Disney stories. The animation and art direction is lovely. All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this picture and Mary Blair's colour styling and concept art (she also did concept art and colour styling for Alice in Wonderland Peter Pan The Three Caballeros and many many others) manage to wiggle their way on screen. The colours and designs are lovely especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scenes as well as in those pretty little moments here and there. Overall Cinderella ranks as one of the best Disney fairy-tales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the Disney philosophy that dreams really can come true. ",positive
" I appreciate movies like this: smart and well-crafted entertaining absorbing well-acted and nicely directed. Nobody -- even Pacino -- is chewing the scenery* trying to stand out; one of the film's most effective moments (Aielo pulling over at his beloved off ramp) is chilling precisely because of its restraint. Not as good as say QUIZ SHOW CITY HALL is of a similar cloth: engaging the mind as well as eye ear and heart. Why such well-hewn entertainment flops at the box office is anybody's guess. *You know Pacino does chew it up in one particular scene but precisely because it's required. Great scene too. ",positive

My kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless.. thank god for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu thank you Maria Popistasu thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :) ",positive
" I have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I never got the chance to meet him but I have never heard anybody say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not. I believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools. I also agree with other comments - what have I got to moan about? He took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour. God Bless. I couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being changed. I have enough trouble with my son's. ",positive
" I spied this short on a DVD of best new Zealand shorts all great but The french Doors was amazing. It starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen. Just as you relax into the hum drum of home renovation the most spookiest thing happens. EEEEkkk I wanted to stop watching but I was glued. The films dips into the primal fear of the dark and with little if not any special effects. It chills you right to the bone. A simple yet brilliant concept opened up all those memories of when I was young and dream't up the most improbably but spooky situations. The film makers visual style are bang on and the lead character takes you convincingly through the story. It is a quality short that I haven't seen in quite some time. The French Doors has all the hallmarks of a great feature alas it finishes after ten minutes or so. Never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more. Loved it and well done and thanks for the ride. These New Zealanders are really turning out the talent. A new fan. ",positive
" In 1970 after a five year absence Kurosawa made what would be his first film in color. Dodes' Ka-Den is a film that centers around many intertwining stories that go on in a small Tokyo slum. The title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy makes as he imagines he is operating a train. We slowly get to know more of the people in the small community the two drunks who trade wives because they are not happy with the ones they have. The old man who is the center of the town who helps out a burglar that tries to rob him. The very poor father and son that cannot ever afford a house so they imagine one up of their own. By the end of the film the stories all come full circle some turn out happy others sad. Since this was Kurosawa's first color film you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows. Maybe too much. This movie goes in many different directions and it's hard to settle down and get into it. But don't get me wrong Dodes' Ka-Den may not be Kurosawa's best but coming from the greatest director of all time it's much better than 99% of today's films. ",positive
" Imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch As soon as I first heard that my attention was locked on the Trailer And after the First Episode I found my self in love with this show. A Modern day Fairy Tale that Brings my Spirits up and Holds my attention throughout the entire show. I think the Acting and Casting is just perfect Each Character brings Something Unique to the show that adds to it's perfection. Even the one time Villains manage to overflow with A Unique sense From the Bee Man to the Guy who can Swallow Kittens they never seem to let me down. And the Deaths that would Normally lead to a Depressing Moment often end up being Purely Comical (Such as an Exploding Scratch & Sniff book) Even with the large amount of Crime shows we have now a days Daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest Being not just a Mystery but a love story Comedy and a Fairy Tale with a hint of Drama all baked into one Wonderful pie.....err show. What really shocked me was the fact that it was on ABC For Years I never had a reason to turn to ABC But this brought me back each week with a Smile on my face. It was as if Pushing Daisies Brought ABC back to life for me. But just like that after two seasons A few Awards A Large Fan Base and Positive Responses from Critics the show has been dropped. It seems as though Ned has Touched ABC again and forever killed it for me. I will always be a fan of this show though And I Recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch. ",positive
" Hrm-I think that line was from the old movie posters. This is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading In the future... is going to be fun. This means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you. In this case In the future... means that instead of fighting wars nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine well that's never terribly clear but it's probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously capitalists i.e. us ) and bad guys (Commies!) and there are big stop-motion robots. Sadly the effects budget was pretty slim so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots. There are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes and then a big space fight near the end. The space fight is especially nice as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget. With said money now spent the climactic fight degenerates into (and I'm not making this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. I can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads. Like I said-it's dumb. That's why I bought the tape. ",positive
" Damn was that a lot to take in. I was pretty much mesmerised throughout. It was pretty perfect though I would say the editing had a lot to do with that. I can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them (Anton especially) to get all of this footage without any serious... beef. The Dandy's did come off well-together middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt. Great piece of film-making and great choice of subject(s). I recommend this to any music/film fan. You'll probably learn something about film-making. ",positive
" at first I had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this: that shots of fat people sunbathing etc were cheap shots in a way. OK so he's doing diane arbus meets. . . whatever. . . but it wasn't long before I realized that this wasn't being done in a dehumanizing way as the images unfold I felt that the problem was entirely the audience's: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly something that ought not to be shown. if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal. however the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling incredible performances and to think the scene was improvised. that blonde guy is a genius actor. finally I want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a OK character that breaks that mold so don't oversimplify the film by overlooking him. yes his dog gets killed. this ain't a rosy picture of the world but it's not . . . completely hopeless. anyway I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all. I wouldn't say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest but I say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it. . . ",positive
" This is one of the best episode from the second season of MOH I think Mick Garris has a problem with women... He kill'em all they are often the victims (Screwfly solution Pro-life Valerie on the stairs I don't remember the Argento's episode in season 1 etc. obviously Imprint). I think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and I don't know. Never least Right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense (specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful). The acting is like the entire series regular I could be worst like Pro-life or We scream for Ice cream . Also I think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on... the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like Cigarrette burns (The best of all) Homecoming (The most funny) Imprint (really shocking).

" Heartland was in production about the same time as Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate - Heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film. Heaven's Gate was the biggest and most expensive ($40 mil in 1980!) Hollywood flops of all time its failure resulted in the sale of the United Artists studio to MGM -imdb entry Heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing direction photography and acting. It easily draws you into the beauty joys hardships and sorrow of pioneer life. It's sad that Hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys (based on a director's single big hit) and neglect such a wonderful story. ",positive
" Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent. Without Dudley Moore John Gielgud Liza Minnelli and a few others this film could have been a disaster. It is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood (the psycho -like music at the wedding fight) but the acting overcomes it. The character Arthur is hilarious with his drunken comments. But he develops well into a more mature well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will. The end is fairly corny though. I wont give it away but it could be improved. Worth seeing many times. ",positive
" The first and only time I saw the woman in black was I think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on TV back in 1989. It was Christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. I was quite young at the time but i'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father!. There are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every Hollywood movie so every creak thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there's no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there's no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on. This is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door! A superb ghost story I've never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on TV i cant believe the BBC has deleted it after (to my knowledge) only one showing!

" Terrific film with a slightly slow start - give it a chance to get cooking. Story builds in interest and complexity. Characters and story line subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments. Superb New York City locations - gritty real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of Sex in the City - in fact the entire film is an antidote to the HBO/Hollywood notion of New York City sex and relationships. It's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. LOVED IT! Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi Rosario Dawson and her love interest (forgot his name!).

" Fever Pitch is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother (though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes). I have lived through a milder version of such a story as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the Mets first World Series win and then I watched the Mets clinch their next one because I was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood National League team's other heartbreaking failures to win it again (and it was me who took our older son to his only Fenway Park game as I caught a bit of Red Sox fever as a graduate student in Boston). So compared to reality the script believably creates two people with actual jobs. It is particularly impressive that Drew Barrymore's character is a substantive workaholic who has anti-Barbie skills though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents don't completely work. It is even set up credibly how she meets Jimmy Fallon's math teacher and how she falls for his winter guy -- though it's surprising that his Red Sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn't tip her off to his Jekyll-and-Hyde summer guy. Their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown-up way from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him centered around that they are both facing thirty and single. Fallon surprisingly rises to his character's gradual emotional maturity. While the ending borrows heavily from O. Henry the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the Sox's incredible 2004 season into a revised story line (with lots of cooperation from the Red Sox organization for filming at the stadium). The script goes out of its way to explain why Fallon doesn't have a Boston accent as an immigrant from New Jersey but that doesn't explain why his motley friends don't. The most authentic sounding Boston sounds come from most of his summer family of other season ticket holders who kindly kibitz the basics of Sox lore to neophyte Barrymore (and any such audience members). The song selection includes many Red Sox fans' favorites from the opening notes of the classic Dirty Water though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear.

" When I was over at Hollywood video I looked through their clearance out movies and there was DEMONICUS for five buckaroos plus fifty percent off! I saw it only once before and couldn't pass up this great deal! The second viewing was much better than the first. The box is so cool and the music is very good. If you haven't seen Demonicus yet I recommend that you do or if you rented and hated Demonicus do give it another chance as another viewing of it may change your mind. If you seen a copy at Hollywood Video for the price I got it for don't pass it up as it is a great deal! Demonicus is well a very different but entertaining movie.Believe it or not is like watching a interactive video game with out playing it!It has very low budget and actors I'M sure that nobody is familiar with. We began the the video game uh I mean film with a guy and a woman some where in Italy and there is a cave that actually looks like a rail road/train track tunnel and she says don't go in there and what does he do?The normal stuff!HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO HER! He goes in there and find lots of gladiator artifacts and armor and a almost perfectly preserved body of a legendary gladiator named Tyrannous!Where did the chair come from that Tyrannous was sitting on and how did his body stay so good and where did the Cauldron Pot come from?So every cave is complete with a Caultron Pot?Tyrannous is wearing his armor helmet and has a weapon or two.He does the dumbest thing a person could do he puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of Tyrannous! From there he walks around just killing all of the campers near by to bring back the real Tyrannous. Now I said before its like a video game.Its hard to explain but it just feels like it.The music even sounds like video games.The acting is really terrible.The actors say things like why is he doing this oh he was nuts already and Fine since he's nuts i'm going home!Also the movie also has some major errors like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a break! This movie has some errors but it isn't a classic like Werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movies then you better see Demonicus! ",positive
" I watched The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse' Drive-in Cult Classics (featuring Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think it is a very good film. This movie packs a lot of story into a very short time. You have hippies rock music bikers lesbians sexual impropriety blackmail and murder all in one spot! The lead actors do a credible job. And I found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interesting. However the supporting cast primarily the bikers delivers a stilted performance particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words. Perhaps they used real bikers instead of actors. A couple of the characters in particular were exceptionally believable. The musical score is absolutely spot-on for the times the tempo and for moving the story forward. I found the music a real treat. I noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of The Food I googled them; but couldn't find anything... In any case George E. Carey who wrote produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much (of a wayward married man brought to redemption through trials and tribulation; and a little help - of course) that he wrote produced and starred in Weekend with the Babysitter.

" I have bought the DVD of this version to compare against the current BBC 2005 version (which is brilliant). The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for TV and who died this year (2005). I remember great acting especially from Rigg and Elliott and moving music. (Music in the 2005 version is far more understated but very telling.) Just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's boyfriend not Esther's. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in either version nor did he play Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. Both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of Dickens' great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect and the sentimentality may make you wince at times but I defy you not to cry - and laugh! ",positive
" The Bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which a beautiful rainbow-haze of socio-introspection emerged inspiring such famed derivatives as Cop Land The Departed The Godfather 3 and most recently of course The Wire. With multi-faceted characters and story lines that have been described as '4-dimensional Shakespeare' The Bill grabbed you by the collars from episode one and just would not let you go. The show covered anticipated and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and 2010. The most famously prescient moment being episode 19 of series 5 which aired on the eve of the second Gulf War. Detective Jim Carver's misguided - and ultimately career ending - drugs raid on Craig 'Fun Boy' Richardson's flat in the Jasmine Allen Estate in early 2003 was widely viewed as a predictive allegory for the coalition's failure to find weapons of mass destruction following the invasion of Iraq several months later. However it was the work the Bill did to try and highlight some of the lesser-known problems experienced by police officers that won it the most praise. This was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as helmet-phobia under-uniform cross-dressing in-van homosexuality lost truncheons casual drunken bestiality (regretted) siren aversion syndrome (SAS) groin chaffing caused by chasing suspects while wearing an overly starched uniform and many many more issues that still trouble disturb haunt and excite officers to this day. The last word should go to one of The Bill's most famous fans Nelson Mandela: it is no exaggeration to say that I would not have made it through the dark void of loneliness that summed up my last years of incarceration on Robben Island if it wasn't for the heart-warming casual buffoonery of Reg Hollis.

" Look if I were interested in a Nancy Drew book what I would do is pick up a book and read it. I'm not. Ever since I can remember I read people trashing movies because it wasn't like the book. I'm sorry - in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books however I'm sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form. When Lord of the Rings came out people complained. When the third one won an Oscar - The book was better. When I watched To Kill a Mockingbird the book was better. Now a bunch of people are upset yet again because Nancy Drew wasn't like the book. I'm not saying Nancy Drew is going to win any Oscars - if anything it'll be one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I'm saying give film a break. It's film not paper. As a movie I found Nancy Drew quite enjoyable - featuring cameos from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and supporting roles featuring Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on the O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). This is the first time I've seen Emma Roberts in a movie and frankly I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and of Eric's; her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict. A lighthearted movie in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is nice now and again. I give it ten stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie would love to see it again and will probably buy it upon DVD release. ",positive
" Mario Lanza of course is The Great Caruso in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth Dorothy Kirsten Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today. The film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza Kirsten Judmila Novotna Blanche Thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film. If you're a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from Lucia will strike you as odd - even if Caruso's wife Dorothy just had a baby girl. Also it's highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him. In taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso's life. What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film. These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in Girl of the Golden West There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. The reason for that photo? His only shirt was in the laundry. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor Talking-Machine Company (later RCA Victor). He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake. Instead the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha which never happened. He had a hemorrhage during L'Elisir d'amore at the Met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the Met his last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida as indicated in the film but the Duke in Rigoletto. So when it says on the screen suggested by Dorothy Caruso's biography of her husband that's what it was - suggested. What is true is that Dorothy's father disowned her after her marriage and left her $1 of his massive estate. They also did have a daughter Gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). However Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy. Some people say that Lanza's voice is remarkably like Caruso's but just listen to Caruso sing in the film Match Point -- Caruso's voice is remarkably unlike Lanza's. In fact from his sound had he wanted to Caruso could have sung as a baritone. He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello a dramatic tenor role which Lanza definitely was not. Lanza's voice deserved not to be compared with another. He made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music. He sings the music in The Great Caruso with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career. His acting is natural and genuine. Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herself. Really a film for opera lovers and Lanza fans which are probably one and the same. ",positive
" After her Oscar-nominated turn in Secrets & Lies Brenda Blethyn starred in the equally great Saving Grace . And let me tell you this is not the sort of movie that you find every day. After her husband commits suicide Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt. Fortunately she finds a way to make ends meet: marijuana. That's right Grace starts cultivating it. Every aspect of this movie was played to great effect; there isn't a dull moment anywhere in it. And I sure didn't see that end scene coming! But anyway you gotta see this movie. You just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it. If nothing else it might function as a good lesson about knowing one's finances. But of course there's a LOT more to it than that! ",positive
" I really really love this show! I have always liked the 1990's shows of Space Ghost! This show was hilarious and I can't believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would take such a funny show like this off the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from the Space Ghost cartoons SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his every day life with his Mom and Dad and his best friend who likes to drop in a lot Zorak! My favorite episodes were the one where Zorak gets this really good singing voice and then his voice doesn't give him any money that Zorak made from singing at all. Another episode I like is the one where Brak and Zorak didn't finish their homework and then they go back from Sunday to Friday and they just goof off and then they go back to the day homework was invented and then when they go back to the present homework didn't exist! Another episode I like is the one where Brak's Dad and their next door neighbor Thundercleese the Robot keep getting into this agrument and then they get eaten by a giant worm. Another episode I liked was the one where Zorak makes a bully stand and then some new guy took over his stand. I also like a lot of the other episodes! One thing that never fails to make me laugh is when Zorak is getting beaten up blasted and zapped! ",positive
" Ok the film wasn't going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum and it is a modern update on It's a wonderful life . But it's just come out as a cheap release on DVD and there are a lot worse ways of blowing $13.

However it's an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don't think too much in it. ",positive
" The film had many fundamental values of family and love. It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story. The script was clear( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children)and was enjoyable and humorous at times. There were a few charged symbols to look for. The cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today(which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out). It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it. Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didn't like either but in all it was a good movie. ",positive
" In all truth this really isn't a movie so much as an extended final episode; by this I mean that had you NOT followed the TV series (Homicide: Life On The Street) I suspect that you would have a hard time following this made-for-tv movie. Having said that Homicide: The Movie is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about a television production that EVERY single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program. The movie brings out that sense of family not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well. It's all very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the LAST time we will see them all together again under the title of HOMICIDE. Story-wise I found this film somewhat lacking. Giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived and I felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position as Leiutenant. Also Det. Bayliss's extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but I for one NEVER felt that it needed to be; I enjoyed being left with a mystery (let us recall that the very first episode's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series I can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after H:LOTS had been canceled but I would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series. Now if they'd just release it on DVD... ",positive

" I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school and it left me with a stunning impression. Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own. Her story which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes was both sad and inspiring. As part of our study we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story and it blew me away. The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover by the name of Rochester) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters. I cannot imagine anyone else in their roles. (The other performances of Rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion energy and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately. I say that Timothy Dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of Rochester. Zelah Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre but she captures Jane's quiet but firm and passionate nature brilliantly. She holds in her emotions like the Jane of the book at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in Jane's passionate scenes. The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to Jane and Rochester's devoted relationship.) As well the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly and the sets fit the Gothic nature of the story. I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale. If you have not read the book before then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story. ",positive
" Since starting to read the book this movie is based on I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of Atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book I've ever seen it would probably not have mattered. I'm trying to figure out what the cause is and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it. It's not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie which is why since I started reading the novel I'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie; it's more like some books just can't make the transition. Ms. Minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be I feel not filmable. I think that Ms. Minton's work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value. I cannot yet report that Evening the film does not represent Evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since I'm only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess I'm writing this because I feel that if you're going to adapt a novel adapt it but don't make it something else that it's not. I'm not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway and we would not have Evening in its distressed form if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But it's too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone because Evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own. Thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are.

" I thought The River of Souls was a very good Babylon 5 movie with some exceptional performances from Martin Sheen Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this were an episode of the series (without the humour) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the series. Personally I've always preferred Scoggins to Christian although granted JMS didn't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the Byron/Telepath plot. If you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the poorer actors in those scenes then this movie is solid stuff. Probably my third favourite of the four movies but in no means bad at all.

" I thought that The sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie.When I finally saw it I took a good surprise.The movie isn't great thing but it's very fun and the action scenes are very well done.This movie reminded me TV series like 24 or Alias.It's very similar to that series and it reminded me too to the Wolfgang Petersen's thriller In the line of fire.If you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies you will be disappointed.But if you go with little expectations you will enjoy The sentinel.

" Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The take on lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently I'm a lawyer he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie gets better each time I see it (which is quite often). ",positive
" Kiera Nightly moved straight from the P&P set to this action movie... she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically. A great success in Love Actually and as Lizie in Jane Austen's classic she is once again having a go . Just as her bikini clad warrier woman in King Arthur was more skin than muscle it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life... but then this is exactly what Domino Harvey (the real one) did and I (being one of Nightly's biggest fans) believe she carries if off. Stuff.... * 90210 (for the non American world) is the post code of Beverly hills in LA where all the film stars live. * Domino Harvey father's mostfamous film was Manchurian Candidate (which appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in June 2005 after having been arrested for drug dealing. She had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film. * Kiera Knightly alludes to Domino Harvey's sexuality in her interview with Lucy Liu. If you find this film a bit far fetched then check out Domino Harvey as the facts are more amazing than the fiction. ",positive
" Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after WWII. Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner. This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thank God with in a few years we would begin to let Indians play themselves in western films. The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona. I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach High Noon or Shane but it gets an above average recommendation from me. . ",positive
" Her Deadly Rival (1995): Starring Harry Hamlin Annie Potts Lisa Zane Tommy Hinkley Susan Diol Roma Maffia Robert C. Treveiler D. L. Anderson William Blair Sean Bridges Robin Dallenbach Wilbur Fitzgerald Dale Frye Stan Kelly Deborah Hobart David Lenthall Lorri Lindberg Chuck Kinlaw Amy Parrish Melissa Suzanne McBride Ralph Wilcox Al Wiggins Jeff Sumerel Daria Sanford....Director James Hayman Screenplay Dan Vining. Actor Harry Hamlin (of LA Law fame Clash of The Titans and other films) seems perfectly cast in this Lifetime type film directed by James Hayman and released in 1995. He and his wife Lisa Rinna would later work on a film about sex addiction. Her Deadly Rival is at first glance similar to the better known Hollywood box-office hit Fatal Attraction . In Rival happily married couple Jim and Kris Lanford move into a new home in the typically beautiful suburbs. They have the seemingly perfect marriage- they are deeply in love despite a routine lifestyle. But then a mysterious admirer sets her eyes on Jim. Her identity is never revealed despite an attempt by Jim and even investigators to discover who she is. She constantly harasses Jim through phone calls and letters. His marriage nearly flounders as his wife begins to think he's having an affair and trying to cover it up. While Harry Hamlin Annie Potts and the rest of the cast - Lisa Zane Tommy Hinkley Susan Diol Roma Maffia Robert C. Treveiler D. L. Anderson William Blair- each seem to be straight out of a soap opera. But this is a very suspense-filled drama and has its good moments. There is a twist at the end. Spoiler Alert. All I have to say is her deadly rival was only herself. Based on a supposedly actual case Jim's wife Kris suffered from multiple personality disorder and that was what ruined her marriage. Even if the story is not terribly impressive even if the acting is only a step above soap opera acting this film has its moments. Especially moving are the intimate scenes between Jim and his wife and the final scene in which when Jim learns the truth he can't believe what he has just heard. The movie is probably a little too long and boring in some parts but it's the kind of TV movie that usually does well especially on Lifetime which continues to produce films of this kind of the domestic thriller type or seduction stories. Trashy but everyone likes trash. ",positive
" Spoilers! From the very moment I saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10:00 news I wanted to see it. I don't remember who it was or which local Omaha newscast carried the review but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going Nebraskan. They showed a snippet from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret when she's swimming in the pool. Glover's character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out. I was hooked. There was one problem though. I was only 13 years old at the time and I had to wait a year until it came out on cable. Let's just say it was worth the wait! If ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it. To call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement. The film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. He's sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy. Then there's Robert Trebor's (nice name by the way!) character Leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme. He is a whimpering sweating coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason. Who could forget the wake-up call he gives Vanity with the giant teddy bear? After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up against Scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until Glover goes after his wife! The conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up. I don't know why I love this movie so much. It really should creep me out but it doesn't. Maybe it's because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try. It's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like Glover's running around out in L.A. looking for trouble. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle. Hey sport have a nice day! This film has plenty of shootouts cool cars great dialog (like the line in my opening statement) and decent acting. Plenty of cameos by real life porno stars. Look for Ron Jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at Glover's place. Another thing I must add: How hot are the women in this film??? Wow! Travolta did right by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see Vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential American Beauty. 9 of 10 stars. So sayeth the Hound. Added Feb 14 2008: RIP Roy Scheider! ",positive
" Red Skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease. His shows certainly brought a laughter to the American households of years back. He would begin the show with an opening monologue. Afterwards we would have a variety of characters. Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? I remember one episode where as a king Red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness. Go know that Red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life. He lost a son to leukemia at age 11 or so. His wife Georgia died by suicide. ",positive
" This story is beautifully acted. It is both sad and heartwarming about a young girl's journey to discover where she has come from and where she is going. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car crash and ever since she has been labeled the 'miracle baby' she is dyslexic and is finding life a bit tough. Her findings along the way affect those closest around her. Her relationship with her guardian and her guardian's ex boyfriend are handled very delicately and sensitively and the whole of the supporting cast are genuine 3 dimensional and believable. Set around a peach canning factory in small town Australia this is a warm gentle erotic film and leaves you with a pleasant feeling when the credits close. After reading some of the other rather shallow comments about Hugo Weaving I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly cast and was extremely sexy. No he is not Brad Pitt but that doesn't mean that he isn't attractive. ",positive
" Being from a small town in Illinois myself I can instantly relate to this movie. Considering the era it was made in the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people I grew up with. Yes the plot is so-so. And yes the Acting is not going to get nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. But that isn't the point. The point is to suspend reality and just have FUN. And this movie has Fun aplenty. From the greedy uncaring banker to the well meaning but dimwitted deputy this movie was made to poke fun at the SciFi genre and small town living at it's best. Who can't smile at the sight of the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid? and I LOVED the FarmZoid. Wish I had one when I was growing up. Overall considering the technology they had available at the time this is a pleasant romp into one's childhood when you could sit back on a Saturday afternoon Popcorn in hand and laugh at the foibles of small town living. This is a movie I would watch again and again if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways. ",positive
" This movie is full of references. Like Mad Max II The wild one and many others. The ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference (or tribute) to Peter Lorre. This movie is a masterpiece. We´ll talk much more about in the future. ",positive
" Arriving by boxcar in New York City the shrewd young woman with the BABY FACE begins to methodically canoodle her way to the top floors of power in a great bank. Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre-Code drama. Without a shred of decency or regret she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of the men unlucky enough to find themselves in her way. A wonderful actress Stanwyck has full opportunity here to display her ample talents. Appearing quite late in the story George Brent is a welcome addition as the one fellow possibly able to handle Stanwyck; his sophisticated style of acting makes a nice counterpoint to her icy demeanor. Douglas Dumbrille Donald Cook & Henry Kolker portray a succession of her unfortunate victims. John Wayne appears for just a few scant seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for Stanwyck's affections. This would be the only time these two performers appeared together on screen. Movie mavens should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy customer and Charles Sellon & Edward Van Sloan as bank executives - all unbilled. The music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film perfectly punctuating the plot is Baby Face' (1926) by Benny Davis & Harry Akst and St. Louis Blues' (1914) by W.C. Handy. BABY FACE is a prime example of pre-Code naughtiness. In its frank & unapologetic dealing with sex it is precisely the kind of film which the implementation of the Production Code in 1934 was meant to eliminate. ",positive
" I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as I did with the 1971 version) than to me it is not all that great. Of course this could be due to the fact that I was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out. However I have seen many remakes where I have liked the original and older one better. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion I felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so blase .(Boring) ",positive
" But the fun is in the journey. I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times. Yes it's predictable and yes it's a cliché romantic comedy. But the point is that it's a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways. The dialog is dead-on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold the actress there deserves honorable mention! For those that panned it for being predictable - If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the way. Great date movie great movie for a happy cry... ",positive
" The greatest games of Kasparov or Fischer can be a mess for a total rookie. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is the clue! This is a PRIVATE plot built as a PRIVATE enterprise. This is a self-destructive and a self organized plot. As a conclusion the scenario described the perfect professional plot: private self organized self-destructive with no trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart director with some money. All can be done just by delegation. The director must be just trigger. If the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered. All the actors' performances are well done with some special mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney. ",positive
" Okay the recent history of Star Trek has not been good. The Next Generation faded in its last few seasons DS9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before and Voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise. So when they announced a new Star Trek series I did not have high expectations. And the first episode Broken Bow did have some problems. But overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp. I'll get the nits out of the way first. The opening theme is dull and I don't look forward to sitting through it regularly but that's what remotes are for. What was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room. They need to cut that nonsense out. But the plot was strong and moved along well. The characters though still new seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. The Vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before with a slightly ominous theme. I particularly liked the linguist who is the first Star Trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears. They seemed to stay true to Trek lore something that has been a significant problem in past series though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields the instant invention of technology that can fix anything and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories. Anyone want to start a pool on how long before the Borg show up? All in all the series has enormous potential. They are seeing the universe with fresh eyes. We have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series. How did the Klingons go from just insulting to war? How did we meet the Romulans? How did the Federation form and just who put Earth in charge. Why is the prime directive so important? If they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes this will be an interesting series. My favorite line: Zephram Cochran saying where no man has gone before (not no one ) ",positive
" I just bought the DVD and i must say (after seeing Brazil and Fear an loathing in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. As well of being a fan of the Monty Python movies Terry Gilliam's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller whom Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole and as well (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played the insanity of Jefferey Goines. A must have for sci fi fans or movie fan of any type really because it includes suspense drama action etc. any way the plot In the future 1% of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race which is unleashed in the past by the army of twelve monkeys . James Cole( Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease so scientists in his time can find a cure. Before i go further James Cole lives in an underground society and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans. anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus. During his stay he meets Jefferey Goins( Brad Pitt) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe) who eventually teams up with Bruce to save the world ( as she sees that he is correct in his tellings) he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus( not actually Brad Pitt) and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away.

" A Chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life. His loving wife who supports totally her husband and his ideas is left alone to save her family from starvation. This movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn't get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It went to a young girl with very limited acting potential. This deeply moving and most 'human' feature is a must see for all 'true children' on earth. ",positive
" I am so upset that ABC is giving up on yet another show that has the chance to be a real winner. This show is so good the writing and storyline were great an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. The casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors right on but these are a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show many of us share this whole idea of connections . I really love the characters of Steven Laura Whitney and Damien. But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like even those that only were in for a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance and not interrupted the show midway Also it was not advertised enough. Truly unfair!! to everyone!!. This show showed great promise. I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive. Please join me I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way where is episode 13? I want that last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC we can do it!!! This show is well worth it!!!

" This is the kind of movie the US doesn't make. It's why people rent foreign films. It's a great story about how one person even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty life. Everybody can learn from Georges. It also shows how people that are mentally challenged suffer in their life and shows them in a very realistic way (I think). As its classic in foreign films this movie has a bittersweet ending but that only makes it a better movie. ",positive
" Hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film. The plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straight-forward drama without much to recommend it. Hitchcock's talent though is found in his stunning use of images. Nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols. Especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer. He slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement Hitch has shown us all we need to know. The boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point-of-view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time Hitchcock was. The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women. The object of the boxers' desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love. The only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships. All in all the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller. ",positive
" Poor Basil Rathbone an egotistical composer who's lost his muse. He's been faking it for some time buying his lyrics and his music from various sources. Trouble is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mary Martin words) happen to meet and fall in love. And then they discover what they've been doing. Complications ensue but all is righted at the end. Crosby and Martin sing terrifically. Mary had signed a Paramount contract and also at the same time doubled as a regular on Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. For reasons I don't understand movie audiences didn't take to her so she went back to Broadway and did One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. Basil Rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well. His ego is constantly being deflated by sidekick Oscar Levant and again I'm surprised they didn't do more films together. As in most of Crosby's Paramount vehicles no big production numbers but I agree with the previous reviewer about the title tune being done as an impromptu jam session in a pawn shop. Good job by all. A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment. ",positive
" Ok after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water. The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it's used origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of wierd for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi not to mention they both move in a similar style too). As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke the resemblence of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia etc)...The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's 20k Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia). As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses...As shown in the novel Lord of the Flies glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. I think Mylo Jean the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other INTELLIGENT characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. As for the submarines and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what Nautilius does) I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). As for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #1 best anime I ever watched even now today. I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview. But now that I watched the movie I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis. Overall the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. Also it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing) ",positive
" For me too this Christmas special is one that I remember very fondly. In 1989 I snatched up the 2 CDs I found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now and I would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as I listen. It has been noted elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances on the Muppet Show and they did more than one special together. The good rapport between Denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages. ",positive
" If you loved Long Way Round you will enjoy this nearly as much. It is educational funny interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates two tired mechanics two excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Ewan makes a few appearances but Charley really pulls it off alone. He is funny engaging and still a puddle of stress and doubt. Great stuff! The series wraps up in 7 episodes. Like LWR the preparation is nearly as interesting as the race. Though they cover the ins and outs of the race well there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing. It is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this. The series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths. Yikes. There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR but this one is not nearly as good as the Stereophonics. If you live in the US god knows when it will be released so buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as I did. Oh and be prepared to buy another motorbike. ",positive
" How truly friendly charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial; I rejoiced in seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. It's the document of a longlost craft. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials.) CHANDU is deeply deeply optimistic and hedonistic . It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple unpretentious and friendly fun. Without giving away too muchChandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers. Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way. As to the quite sexy niece Nadji she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the sordid Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu does? Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless mean drunk and this only contributed to his performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle mischievous and cunning and oblique. This might sound like a rather crooked homage to Lugosiyet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I enjoy Lugosi' fancy performances. This serial is unjustly bashed. ",positive
" First of all 'St. Ives' the film is only fairly loosely based on the Robert Louis Stevenson story of the same name but for once this is not a criticism. The original novel was a work-in-progress unfinished at the author's death and in freely adapting it and giving it an ending the film-makers have brought to life some endearing characters who although different from Stevenson's originals would I am sure have charmed and amused him. It is 1813: Capitaine Jacques de Kéroual de Saint-Yves is a Breton aristocrat orphaned by the Revolution's guillotine now serving as a hussar in Napoleon's army. We meet him going out for the evening claiming that since a hussar who is not dead by 30 is a blackguard he at 34 is now on borrowed time ! Certainly as he faces a string of challenges to duels our dashing hero seems in danger but a surreal prank on his Colonel provides him a way out of the duels and into the bed of a beautiful courtesan/singer. Unfortunately it also results in losing his commission... Further misadventures result in him being taken prisoner by the British and sent to a POW camp in a Scottish castle. While carving toys and boxes Jacques catches the attention of Flora the young niece of Miss Susan Gilchrist a well-travelled woman of the world who lives at Swanston Cottage. They fall in love and most of the story concerns Flora helping Jacques to escape and to find his emigré grandfather the old Comte. Of course there is a problem. Jacques' older brother Alain a dissolute alcoholic is - perhaps understandably - far from pleased when Grandfather disinherits him in front of the whole household the very instant that Jacques has appeared... Cue treachery! There is also an entertaining subplot of the romance between the awkward naïf but good-hearted Major Farquhar Chevening and Aunt Susan who has travelled through most of the Ottoman Empire and been a prisoner of the Turks. Even allowing for a natural prejudice in favour of any film in which the heroines share my surname 'St. Ives' is magic! It combines splendidly swashbuckling swordfights a balloon-flight comedy and romantic adventure. I would recommend it to anyone who loves 'the kind of film they don't make anymore' - Fairbanks Colman Flynn & co. The acting is splendid. Anna Friel makes Flora a spirited and appealing heroine and Jean-Marc Barr is delightful as Jacques a genuinely lovable hero. Miranda Richardson and Richard E. Grant are already great favourites of mine and have great fun as Susan and Farquhar whose relationship runs as a comic counterpoint to that of the leads. As the rakish scheming but ultimately tragic Alain Jason Isaacs shows as he did more recently in 'The Patriot' that he has the classic swashbuckling style besides the dashing good looks! Please please will someone cast him as a *hero* in the genre?!!! My main quibbles with the film concern settings and costumes. In the book the castle in which Jacques is a prisoner is clearly Edinburgh but the film shot in Ireland Germany and France has 'Highlandised' the setting making the retention of place names such as Swanston Inveresk and Queensferry decidedly incongruous. The costumes too are a real hotch-potch from 1780s through to the period in which it is set. While this would not be implausible with more down-market characters making do it seems odd for well-to-do ladies such as the heroines to be wearing 1780s gowns in 1813. Clearly the costuming decision was æsthetic: these earlier styles are visually far more appealing and elegant than Regency fashions and they work in the idealised world of the film. As a whole 'St. Ives' is 90 minutes of pure delight. ",positive
" This obscure de Sica delivers the goods. And it is said the meek shall inherit the earth. This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a Cinderella story. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words Once upon a time... to exemplify the timelessness of its tale for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all. De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best. Abandoning neo-realism he always dallied between that and pure good old film-making he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias!!! Gracias!!!!!!!!!!!! ",positive
" One of THE comedies of the 1970's. Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show. The story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords George and Mildred. The comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing. A man and two women. Richard O' Sullivan is besotted with Paula Wilcox. Its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success. The scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and Richard's frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm. The end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970's but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements. ",positive
" Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music film staring Michael Jackson with different segments. I will rate each segment individually. Segment 1 opens the film with a Music video. The Music video is a concert of Michael Jackson performing the song Man in the Mirror the Music video also show's montages of historical figures such as Gandhi Martin Luther king JR John Lennon and more. The first segment was a good choice to open the film i liked the song and also loved the montage of the historical figures. I even loved the message in the song. I give the first segment a 9/10. Segment 2 shows a montage of Michael Jackson's start from the Jackson five to his solo career. The montage i thought was well made i liked the animation they put into it and i also loved their choices of songs such as I I want you back Beat it Thriller can you feel it and the way you make me feel. The only thing i wish they could have done a little a better in one of the songs in the montage is We are the world . The reason why is all you see is rain drops and in those drops are images of Michael Jackson and the chorus of the celebrities but it's a little hard to see the chorus. Other than that the segment is still good. I give it a 9/10 Segment 3 is the song Bad. You're probably thinking it's Michael Jackson's Music video of bad Well yes and no. This segment is the Music video but it's redone by Kids. The segment was cute but it wasn't as good as the other segments. I give it a 6/10 Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music film that takes place after the kid's version of bad called Speed Demon . The short is about Michael Jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and he disguises himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to get away from them. The claymation in the chase sequence was great but some parts in the film the Claymation characters looked a little fake when they interact with real people. Also at the end of the clip out of nowhere Michael Jackson rabbit costume comes to life and he's dancing with it. I liked the dancing but that was like out of nowhere. I give it a 8/10 Segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Grammy winning Music video Leave me alone. The Music Video is about the media poking their nose at Michael Jackson's personal life and Michael Jackson feels they won't leave him alone no matter how much he's proved innocent. The music video really speaks out( but keep in mind this happened before the child molestation this just all about the rumors of him in the 80's.) but i didn't feel this Video should be in this Movie because it's a kids Movie and i don't think kid's will understand what he's singing about. I give this Music video 8/10 Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called Smooth Criminal. Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wishing star as a crime figure to protect children ( including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) from an Evil Mobster named Mr Bigg (Played by Joe Pesci). The segment i thought really brought out the film especially when he danced and sang the song Smooth Criminal with a bunch of Criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The weird thing about the Segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why. Also Joe Pesci character talks about Drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean why would you talk about drugs in a kids film. Other wise it was good. My rating for this segment is a 8/10 Segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie. The film end's with Michael Jackson singing a Cover version of the Beatle's Song Come Together and then during the credit's we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael did a good cover of Come Together and i think it was good idea putting including a group of good singer's with a talented musican like him. My rating is 9/10 This movie is a good Michael Jackson film i think it really brings out children s Imagination. The film is almost as Imaginative as the Beatles animated movie Yellow Submarine if you like Michael Jackson and you're up to a film with a lot of creativity this is the film. My Overall rating for this movie is 8/10 ",positive
" I have a lot of time for all the Columbo films but this one in particular was extremely well written and the solution at the end very effective. However my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film between Columbo and the murderer (I apologise if I've not remembered every detail of this exactly). It's the most striking image of Columbo I've seen: the view is from inside the darkness of the cupboard where the victim was murdered and into the room beyond which is lit up by daylight. Columbo is sitting in a high-backed armchair facing the doorway (and us) contemplating the cupboard and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in light. There's no sound. The camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him. He's deep in meditation puffing gently on a cigar swirls of smoke from the cigar circling slowly upwards as he thinks. Then the dialogue starts. Superb. ",positive
" The visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films. It also seems a lot more erotically charged than I remember the other films being. If you're a big fan of flying prehensile hair and tongues that can reach all the way down into your stomach you'll like this film. ",positive
" The first thing I thought after watching Mystery Men was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so adorable and funny that it's status as a bomb defies logic. Well I hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit and you can count me amoung it's fans. Simply put and without giving too much away this movie does for comic books what the Princess Bride did for fairy tales and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? did for classic cartoons. That should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to (this is one of those cases like the Iron Giant where the studio had no clue what it had on it's hands). Rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little offbeat. You won't listen to the BeeGees in the same light ever again. ",positive
" Having read Diamond's book I was slightly disappointed in the series but all in all it is quite informative. Reading the other comments it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug. Is Diamond a little preachy ? Sure. Like a lot of academics he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase 'guns germs and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We get it after about the first 10 minutes. Is Diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing condensing some very long complicated history down to 'smallpox swords and horses' wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures. Is he preaching *against* Western Civilization in any way ? Nope. Not a word. Not to my ear. All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly *not* that luck is the only reason. In the end if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence. ",positive
" Yeah it's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but it's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a manly man. You gotta love Judy Davis no matter what she's in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performance. The scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie. The unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention. Overall I give it an 8/10. Go see it. ",positive
" Contrary to popular belief this title to me at least is not so very bad. In fact. I regard it as a favoured film of all time. The welding of stories wasn't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series however despite all this you can watch it quite happily. For a feature film of its day the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable. The sound/audio track is a personal favourite of mine. Nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their now badly cast US dub counterparts. The sync is perfect in every shot. I had a few issues with the casting for the 'alien' voices (please forgive the crude naming it has been a while since i've seen it). Otherwise however the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters of this movie. Dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago. I loved the OSD's from back then but the castings often let series down. At this point i would like to add that this was one of the first anime i saw in my life. It has historical value to me but even after seeing the original Megazone 23 it remained stronger and more watched in my collection. To my knowledge the title only ever made it to the US in Texas. Personally i think its a big shame. Had the correct audience been subject to it i think Robotech the Movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years. I am involved with anime each day of my life and everyone i have shown this movie thought it was a nicely put together title. Watching the film after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the evident plot holes between shows. However without seeing the originals a viewer wouldn't really notice. Since the animation is identical in style there was no reason to question it back in its day. The UK had very limited access to anime. Laser discs were the most productive media. Personally i like the way Carl had the balls to at least push the genre. I mean Harmony wasn't going to put up the cash for the series to get publicised. Despite the few picky faults people have had with this film The eighties feel of it keeps me in love. If you watch Megazone 23 now to its original Japanese audio or the new dub i believe you will be greatly disappointed with the OSD. Cast your minds back to the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and imagine new eighties audio to E.V.E. Saying all this. This film's popularity nowadays is most likely down to its rarity on the open market. Personally it spawned a collection for me. I'm now scouring the world for merchandise from the three components that made it up and if i ever get to meet Carl Macek ill shake his hand for the effort and buy him a pint or a crate for getting me into anime.

" Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar Europe. Like TTM there is much inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives. But I'd have to say that The Third Man has a more well-crafted storyline. Zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. This movie is unrelentingly grim-- noir in more than one sense; one never sees the sun shine. Grim but intriguing and frightening. ",positive
" Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderfully over-the-top Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young wonder kid (a solid Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick. While not up to Sleuth standards Deathtrap is none the less a very capable twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by Ira Levin. The performers are obviously having a field day with the material with Caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto. The film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall Deathtrap is solid well acted and suspenseful fun.

" After too many years of waiting Anne Rivers Siddons' noted 1979 book The House Next Door has finally been filmed. The result veers a bit from the novel which especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it's a TV film the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good just not as great as the book one of Stephen King's favorites and one of mine as well. With more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release all the richness inherent in the original three-part story of the ominous ultramodern house could have been explored and nurtured especially the climactic revelation near the very end. Still the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless malevolence. There are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed. Actually one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next-door amateur-artist neighbor who is trying to visualize its corruption on canvas. Be sure to read the great novel. ",positive
" Shrek anyone? Well imagine Shrek in the ice age. Remember the ending of Shrek? Of cause you do. Now imagine that Shrek turns into a human and so does the princess. Get it? Nice animation actually much more of an art work than Pixar and Disney pictures which are trying to get as close to reality as possible in their drawings. Strong one-liners some social comments that kids won't understand the good guys win. One thing more: Scrat. By the way how does everybody know his name is Scrat? 7/10 ",positive
" I gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old cliché by now but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple. It also showed a different side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend. Also the acting performances are superb - especially Oprah who I now have a new found respect for. Well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy. ",positive
" Normally I don't like series at all. They're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast. These series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mind. The episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital. ",positive
" Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us about our dreams our friends our obsessions our addictions our fears. It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century. The movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things it just tells us a story one that all of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement sadness and grief. The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International playing their dreams our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh it will make you cry at times it will shock you and comfort you it will give you and take from you. Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life and that of my friends and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours. ",positive
" So-so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west. The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book; Pitt's a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to Dave) and Juliette is his poor not-all-there companion. This is a good cast and the story moves along but Pitt isn't belivably scary as a serial killer although it is one of his better earlier roles. The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes who always manages to shine whether in her roles on `Homicide: Life on the Street' or in the brief series `Wonderland.' Vote: 6 ",positive

" This film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments. I loved the character of Matt and also Tiny. They seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is his no good cousin) and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy. I must say I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Aussie actor Eric Bana. My personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that. Overall I liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating. The penalty however I was disappointed in. It was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blast. I am of course kidding. :) ",positive
" Kurosawa fresh into color losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on Tokyo's slums. Kurosawa stretches for a style that was in my opinion his antithesis- that is to say I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make an Ozu picture. Poorly paced poorly conceived this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work. While Ikiru while being mundane and depressing was still interesting and well paced and while Stray Dog depicted the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too heavy handed or boring do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier Kurosawa pictures. Be warned this is not a movie that Kurosawa should be judged by. ",positive
" The most bizarre of the cinematic sub-genres is the so called The Great Ladies of the Grand Guignol : camp horror films which combined over-the-top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in unflattering roles of either long suffering victims or screeching evil harpies. This genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday. What's the matter with Helen is the last drop of this sub-genre with stunning performances of both Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters as the troubled mothers of two convicted criminals who run away from their past to the sunny California in the 1930s to open a talent school to milk out the eagerly mothers who want their daughters to be the next Shirley Temple. In California Debbie gets happiness clients tango tap dancing and a new love interest (Dennis Weaver meanwhile Shelley gets wacko with horrible flashbacks menacing anonymous calls menacing strangers menacing Agnes Moorehead as a radio evangelist cute little rabbits (!) and an unfortunate encounter with an electric fan (ouch!). The sloppy script (penned by Henry Farrell the man who started all this genre with Whatever Happened to Baby Jane along with master director Robert Aldrich Joan Crawford and Bette Davis) is full of plot holes red herrings and wasted opportunities that could had made this movie great: the underlying themes of twisted motherhood (with Debbie and Shelley's characters as failed mothers and the overbearing mommies of the child stars) and obsessive female bonding (Debbie and Shelley relationship and the fact that the few male characters of this movie are either sinister or sleazy even Dennis Weaver dream boat Texan) are wasted. Instead we get Debbie Reynolds musicals interludes and dancing tots although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological chiller. But still this movie is highly entertaining. The two stars and Curtis Harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws. The movie recreation of the 1930's is colorful and elegant (look at Debbie's clothes!) made with a very tight budget. The increasing atmosphere of madness and hysteria is genuinely creepy with a shocking finale that will haunt you for days. And you wouldn't easily forget that silly Goody goody song that runs through the movie either. And seeing an increasingly mad Shelley Winters screw every one of Debbie Reynolds' chances at happiness is a hoot to watch! 8 out of 10. ",positive
" I liked this movie very much. Although this movie doesn't boast of big (or even known) names its very charming. Its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end. My favorite scene is with the baby elephant part. I rate this movie at 7.5 ",positive
" This early Anime movie was a rather good film that I caught once on the Science Fiction channel when Anime was actually popular here in America and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network. I quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet. This film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie though I would rather watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed. This film features a young boy who boards a train called the Galaxy Express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot. He wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who hunts humans for fun. During the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother a beautiful woman named Matel who as with most woman in Anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero or really bad. He goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named Captain Harlock who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series so basically the Galaxy Express takes place in that universe. All in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending. There would be a sequel to this one but it was not quite as good as this one however the ending was a bit more final than it was here. ",positive
" Armageddon PPV The last PPV of 2006 Smackdown brand. Match Results Ahead******** We are starting the show with The Inferno match. Kane v. MVP. This was an okay match. Nothing about wrestling here. This was about the visuals. Overall this was not bad. There were a few close spots here with Kane getting too close to the fire but in the end Kane won with ramming MVP into the fire back first. Nice opener. Let's continue. Teddy Long announces a new match for the tag team titles: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor The Hardyz and MNM IN A LADDER MATCH!!!! Let's get moving! Match two: Fatal four way ladder match. This was total carnage. Judging by three out of the four teams here you would expect chaos. The spots were amazing. A total spot-fest. One point Jeff went for Poetry in Motion and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly afterword Jeff is set on the top rope with two ladders nearby as MNM were going to kill Jeff Matt makes the save and Jeff hits the see-saw shot to Joey Mercury! Mercury is hurt. His eye is shut quickly and is busted open hard way. Mercury is taken out of the match and Nitro is still there. He is going to fight alone for the titles! Regal and Taylor then grab London and suplex him face-first into the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro in a killer spot dropkicks through the ladder to nail Jeff! Awesome! In the end London and Kendrick retain the tag team titles. What a match!!! This was insane. I can't figure out why WWE did not announce this till now. The Buyrate would increase huge. I'm sure the replay value will be good though. Mercury has suffered a shattered nose and lacerations to the eye. He is at the hospital now. Get well kid. No way anything else here will top that. Next up: The Miz v. Boogeyman.(Ugh) This was a nothing match. Will the Boogeyman ever wrestle? The Miz sucks too. After a insane crowd this kills them dead. DUD. Chris Benoit v. Chavo. This was a strong match. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit a killer superplex at one point! Benoit hit EIGHT German suplexes too! Benoit wins with the sharpshooter. Good stuff. Helms v. Yang-Cruiserweight title championship match. This was a good match. Unfortunately the stupid fans did not care for this. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and wrestled well. I agree with JBL. He ranted to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or get out. Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker-Last Ride match. Not too much here. This was a slug fest with a few exceptions. Kennedy at one point tossed Taker off the top of the stage to the floor. The spot was fine. Reaction was disappointing. The end spot was Taker tomb-stoned Kennedy on the hearse and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this win. They both worker hard. Still Kennedy needed this win. Undertaker should have lost. Creative screwed up again. A stupid diva thing is next. I like women. Not this. At least Torrie was not here. That's refreshing. Judging from the crowd Layla should have won. The WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this your bathroom break. Next. Main Event: Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This was also a nothing match. The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can't work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The finish was botched. Finlay hit Batista's knee with a chair shot and Batista no-sold the shot and finished the match. Lame. Not main event caliber at all. Overall Armageddon would have scored less but the ladder match WAS the main event here. That was enough money's worth right there. A few others were solid. The Last Word: A good PPV with the ladder match being the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough. Smackdown needs to stop letting Cena tag along. Let Smackdown stand on their own two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can. ",positive
" This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film. I have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant--while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots--but whatever the cause I have always found this difference fascinating. The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by Charlton Heston. This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international Soylent Corporation has been assassinated. As the film unfolds you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future American society. The rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy(including furniture --a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment). At the same time the masses are dirt poor unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. Overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed! Why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with I really should NOT discuss--it could ruin the film for you. However the film has a great plot and acting and is super-exciting to watch. Plus it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston. Though not for the easily depressed or squeamish this is a great sci-fi film that is allegorical and profound. ",positive
" This is an early film Pilot for the hit Canadian tv show Trailer Park Boys. It was played to executives at a few networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films. The movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around exterminating peoples pets for money. If you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series. I highly recommend it! Rated R for swearing violence and drug use. Its not too offensive either (they dont actually show killing animals) ",positive
" The father of the Who's alcoholic drummer Keith Moon was named Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli who usually OVERACTS did quite a good job in this one and was able to turn cheek on Dudley Moore in every turn. Yes I agree Sir John stole absolutely every scene. It was a very different movie enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life. We often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite. God rest Dudley Moore; this was such an enjoyable movie. Much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby/affluent. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is rather endearing. ",positive
" When will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world? If you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching Bill and Ted's bogus journey. This is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch Keanu and Alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from Bill and Ted's excellent adventure with even more 'style' then they had in 1st movie. It's not rocket science but it's great for a laugh the characters being extremely like-able and the story-line being so radical you have to laugh. Don't expect 'deep-and-meaningfulls' just expect pure fun! ",positive
" A masterful treatment of James Caine's The Postman Always Rings Twice as Luchino Visconti's first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a soulless war-torn Italy. The original negative was thought destroyed but Visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today. A ruggedly handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who had recently revealed her breasts in La Cena delle beffe (1941) star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband. Unusual ending in which although crime does not pay one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime. Excellent direction script acting and cinematography. Reportedly not as good as the French Le Dernier tournant' (1939) but probably better than the US version (1946) featuring Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles. Highly recommended.

Chris Rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedy I've seen in quite some time. Loved it. ",positive
" This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time. The Running Man is one of Arnold`s best and most different films even to this day and when I first saw The Running Man I was so excited to see a movie like this. I just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie.

All Arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed star filled and its one its one of Arnold`s best to date! ",positive
" Perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing albeit completely corny to adults. Not a bad film for a low-budget job. Children will be amazed with Santa's workshop and the magic that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small or homes that have no chimneys at all! Kids will thrill over the Santa's success at thwarting the nasty devil named Pitch (complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl who's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love. And the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents. And what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by Pitch to help capture Santa and ruin Christmas? In the end everyone including the nasty boys get just what they deserve for Christmas! The film will endear children to both Santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world.

" I don't think I'll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger' one of the most awesome action movies ever. That's right you little punks 'Cliffhanger' rules and we all know it. Sly plays Gabe Walker a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. Walker obviously came back at a convenient time because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back... Essentially 'Cliffhanger' is another 'Die Hard' clone. Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. Naturally that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough as Stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. After all isn't that what action movies are all about? 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining and one bad dude. Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever. 'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts definitely Renny Harlin's best effort and a very exciting action movie - 9/10 ",positive
" I probably saw this movie first in about 1995. Since then I've returned to it many times. It's great! I especially like the first and second clips Creation and Civilization Rising. Wow! This was so cool back in the glory days of CG animation. CG is way older than I am as I know the film Tron was made 7 years before my time. But this film was a landmark in the early '90s. It was probably the first collaboration of different CG experiments set to music. I like it so much I think I'll go watch it now. Bye ",positive
" Wang Bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a 'King of masks' for his mastery of Sichuan change art. Liang is a famous opera performer of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is worried that a precious art shouldn't die with Wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to Wang's mind. The film is about prejudices male domination state of art values and most importantly warmth. I can't recommend this film enough. The whole film is in loops. Everything has a significance. Its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes it is an artistic film next five minutes its a sad film next five minutes its a thriller. It just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face. Last scene on the rope is phenomenal. Story and script is flawless. Actors are brilliant. Both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed. Very impressive. It was not even nominated for Oscars. That year 'English patient' got the best film Oscar and in the foreign film category 'Kolya' won. 'Kolya' was just OK and about 'English patient' the lesser said the better. Watch it 9/10. ",positive
" This was a superb episode one of the best of both seasons. Down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average MOH episodes if there is such a thing. A man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving. His airbag worked her's didn't. She is burned beyond recognition (great makeup btw) and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft. BUT even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. Carnage of course ensues and also some extremely gory killings and also some extremely sexy scenes. What more could you ask for you might ask? Well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces. I just loved Rob Schmidt's (Wrong Turn) direction too he has a great knack for horror. Excellent episode this is one I'm buying for sure. ",positive
" I have to agree with everyone else that has posted. I watched it quite a while ago but I'll tell you whenever I hear certain music from this anime I am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling I got when watching it and it does make me cry(such a happy yet sad feeling). I do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience. I was into this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research(and watch the ending a few more times) and I found all my answers and a whole lot more. I love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more.(I've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime) I do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters(some mysterious)and a bit of fantasy action. Also even though this was based on a H-game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and I actually prefer it this way.(I have no problem with mature anime in most cases I prefer it) ",positive
" I can agree with other comments that there wasn't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn't a documentary! It was meant to entertain and I think it did a very good job at it. I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. Like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but I did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good. Despite it wasn't a re-enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade. I found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch. ",positive
" I loved this movie and will watch it again. Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self. I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie. His eyes conveyed more than most actors words. Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention? ",positive
" Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the Sixties and the hollow avaricious Eighties. With The Notorious Bettie Page she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Bettie's life were all the film was concerned about then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly Harron is more interested in America's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III she accomplishes this goal admirably holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own enlightened 21st Century attitudes towards so-called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism this is a film needed more than ever. ",positive
" The Thing About my Folks came in as a surprise. We had no idea about what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta and based on a screen play by one of its stars Paul Reiser proved to be a pleasant time at the movies. Although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome this is a voyage of discovery where Ben gets to know his father perhaps for the first time in his life Ben sees his father for what he really is and not the mythical figure he has in his mind. The film seems to be a vehicle for its star Peter Falk and he runs away with the movie as it was expected. Mr. Falk one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years is an actor of such stature he must be reckoned with. As Sam Kleinman the distant father to Ben he is a man that clearly is misunderstood not only by Ben but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty-seven years. When Muriel the matriarch of the Kleinman clan runs away everyone goes into a panic because this woman who has been the strong figure of the family is vital to keep everyone together. Not knowing where she has gone Sam shows up at Ben's house confused as he feels abandoned suddenly by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years. Ben the youngest son takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of Manhattan into the country. The trip provides the excuse for Ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son. Along the way father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children. The love of Sam for Muriel spans the many years they have known one another; they seem inseparable. Peter Falk is magnificent in the film. He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst. Mr. Falk shines as the older man and there's never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him. Not being a Paul Reiser fan we must confess that as Ben Kleinman he is right. Ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for Muriel the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style.. The film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of Dan Gillham and the excellent musical score by Steven Argila. Ultimately the film shows a great team effort between its director Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser who wrote it for the screen. Although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience it should please anyone. ",positive
" My Kasi Lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman. This film is a lost gem a dead-on satire mockumentary of the early 90's Hip Hop scene when MC Hammer had just began to fade away into that good night. We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would-be riches and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby at the end they finish their journey not far from where they started but at least a little wiser and lot less naive. This is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of but it's the kind of film you either love or hate a lot like Company Man in this regard. I regard this movie like the 1000 islands of upstate New York: it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself. ",positive
" There is a lot of crap coming out of Hollywood lately. A friend sends me movies now and again as a surprise it's awesome. I turned it on and couldn't stop watching it is a drama but with a odd twist. Imagine if Romeo as in Shakepeare had a super power. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should take notice of the new Russian cinema they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without a spectacle. This is a lot like an Asian film with a dark Russian twist. Granted it's not perfect but nothing ever is. You know what the power is but it is never explained nor totally realized until the end. It becomes secondary to the emotion of the story. I don't want to see a remake it is too cool as is the Hollywood system would as usual mess it up. Acting is top notch all around. Directing and Camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there. Kudos to all involved and I will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic. A+++++ If you can find i watch it.

" Enormous fun for both adults and children this film works on numerous levels: there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good (yet subtle) jokes for adults. Glenn Close is at her sublimely evil best as Cruella (`call me Ella') De Ville. After three years in Dr. Pavlov's Behaviour Modification Clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppy-skin fur she had so intensely desired. She even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits. But it wouldn't be a Dalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification. And now she needs one extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round. Ioan Gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the `Second Chance' dog shelter. Though he was in `Titanic' and in last year's television version (as Pip) of `Great Expectations' I didn't recognize him; well he was Fifth Officer Lowe' in `Titanic' and I didn't see `Great Expectations' so I am not terribly surprised. Gerard Depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier-pawn of Cruella. He prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well. His 'Wicked Witch of the West' homage is hilarious. Tim McInnerny is superb is Cruella's not-so-evil henchman  he was also Alonzo ' Cruella's butler in `101 Dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the `Black Adder' Brit-Coms. He plays his usual bumbling good-hearted somewhat dim-witted character to great effect. Oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film. This is unfortunate as the clothing worn by Glenn Close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is being released from the Behaviour Modification Clinic) and worthy of such an over-the-top character. Her clothing alone deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can't be done. Suffice it to say that `102 Dalmatians' is even better than the film version of `101 Dalmatians' that came out in 1996. There is a lot to like here: from the sight gags the dialogue and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family. ",positive
" The movie Frailty is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film. It has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not. Frailty is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong. In Frailty a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons claim to be doing the work of God. It turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called God's Hands . We watch the father kill the demons in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work God and that what they are doing is right. He claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth. God has given him a list of names and in return for his services ; he and his sons will be given protection which basically means the police will never be able to capture them. We see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner. But what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons particularly the oldest son Adam. Adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that. He knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother Fenton. Fenton the other half of this puzzle takes everything in as if it were his own religion. He seems trapped in his father's world of God and demons. I suppose this is because he's so young and easily impressionable. But everything that happens to these three is rather convincing in fact TOO convincing. The events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters. I say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see God. Dad first sees the murders as his mission. His mission eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons. In fact his hallucination is the primary one. His orders and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination. Watch the scene where Dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where I am coming from. Fenton the younger son is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction. Since he is so young it's easy for him to fall into his father's trap. Adam on the other is very skeptical towards his father's actions. ***SPOILERS*** In a way the hallucination ends when Dad is killed towards the end of the movie. (I will not say how or under what circumstances). But I will say that it is not pleasant. After his death it fast-forwards to the present day. (The story is being told through flashbacks as seen through the eyes of the oldest son Adam). In actuality it is Fenton that is telling the story not Adam as originally believed. The story is being told the way he perceived it through his actions and his brother's actions. Fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the FBI agent into his trap. Since religion is a major theme in this movie the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it. Before Dad discovered his newfound mission he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being. His sons Fenton and Adam often sang innocent little children's church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant. After the revelation of Dad's newfound mission they both took off in separate directions - Adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while Fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness. A very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you do not watch it alone. ",positive
" I've watched it plenty of times and I'm planning on buying the full feature. I love all of Jason Steele's comedy. It's very different and unique and is very enjoyable. I love indie films and this one is just great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a talking Spatula named Edward. The order of the events are a bit jumbled making this film very interesting to watch. At first you see Edward fighting the spoons but then the focus changes to earlier in his life. This is a silly movie but of course it's still great. I highly recommend that you watch this film at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. The humour may not match everybody's taste but watch anyway. It'll only take 16 minutes of your time and it's free. GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS! ",positive
" I have to point out before you read this review that in no way is this a statement against Iranian people ... if you really want to read something into it than hopefully you see that I'm against politicians in general ... but if you're looking to be offended ... I can't help you! Not in Iran as this movie is banned there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). Which is a shame because the movie is great. Would it not be for Grbavica this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin. Rightfully so (it was the runner-up or second place if you will). Why? Because it is a movie about oppression. It's not even that this is a complete women issue. It is about the government trying to keep the people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie. But by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear! Another reviewer had a great summary line: Comedy about a tragedy that sums it up pretty well! ",positive
" When I heard that this movie was coming out the night before Halloween I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978 I had to read it before seeing the movie. I'm sure the movie would have been much different to me if I had not read the book. The writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book with minor differences naturally. I think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was Boyle playing the role of Col. I'm not a big fan of Boyle and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie she's always trying to use her over-plumped lips and darkly makeup-ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy. Indeed I think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house. My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family (which is so weird b/c the son was killed in Iraq and in current events there is Casey Sheehan whose mother went on a huge anti-Iraq tirade). In the book obviously the war was not Iraq but rather Vietnam and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter I was truly creeped out. Overall I was impressed with the movie in that it followed the book very well. ",positive
" 24 is the best television show!!!!! It's an incredible TV series with an incredible suspense excellent plots and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best evidence. Because it's only the first episode only the introduction and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and turns. Jack Bauer is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of the senator David Palmer. He can't trust in anybody because people of the CTU may be involved. And when this events occurred his daughter: Kimberly escapes from house to a party. But... At the end of the episode you want to watch more and more and more. It's only the first of the lot and it's excellent. ",positive
" Have just finished watching this film which upset me greatly. Have also been to South Africa twice around the time this film is set. It is certainly hard-hitting and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene'. The slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break and there are certainly few light moments. Will never be able to view Nigel Hawthorne the same again. He came across as a very twisted individual and I found myself disliking him more each time he appeared. Totally agree with Steve-thomp's articulate and well thought-out comments. ",positive
" Uncompromising look at a suburb in 21st century Vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary maker U.Seidl is a provocative minimalistic and intense piece of observation cinema. After the world-wide spread of Big Brother reality shows Hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an unsettling profound level. Hard to like but unignorable piece of European art-cinema might seem cruel and seedy yet manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy manner. A must for lovers of world cinema. ",positive
" What's not to like about this movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. A very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined. Only if. Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie. ",positive
" I contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered. NO ONE I know wanted to see this movie based on the previews and EVERYONE who actually saw it (that I know) absolutely loved it... The advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder. Opened at #4 behind... #1-Rush Hour which I have not seen average IMDb score of 7.4. #2-The Bourn Ultimatum which I have seen awesome movie but 3rd week out average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say). #3-The Simpsons Movie which I have seen okay movie but 4th week out average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion). #4-Stardust average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower then Bourn but that's been our for 3 weeks). Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! This should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on... Awesome movie go see it! ",positive

" A beautiful postcard of New York. The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear. It never did. My teenagers liked it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something. This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done. The ending came with a twist which we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you. As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did. I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch. ",positive
" My girlfriend and I have a thing for Robots. So I try to seek out movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Big ones. They beat the clang and bang out of each other with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. It's really cool. You have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget. It is very hard to dislike this movie. Because of those big robots. They looked like Transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers! It made my girlfriend smile. And that is good enough for me. And special mention must be made of veteran character actor Paul Koslo: as the maniacal Russian Villain whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste like blood (a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-Bela Lugosi accent) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen. This is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation. ",positive
" It was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot the characters in the show were great as well and complimented one another well. I was sorry to see it cut off.. I would have loved to see where it could have went.You found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was frightening and alluring. And I would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became. I will however buy the show just to enjoy it was great to something different on TV. And Paige Turrco who was Caleb's cousin she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to Lucas. Its a shame it isn't around still.. or was never finished i would have loved to see what would have happened. ",positive
" I was the Production Accountant on this movie and I also got to do some voice-over work on it so I'm not entirely unbiased but if it were awful I would say so. I thought it was a fun film not a critically acclaimed masterpiece by any means but there were plenty of laughs along the way. The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine so watching this movie could be good for your health. So many of the actors in this picture hadn't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film. Susan Sarandon of course is one who has since gone on to much greater fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on TV on a weekly basis as a photographer in the Thirty-Something TV drama series. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger still haunting people's dreams. One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedic actor and a truly nice sincere person. We all had fun working on this show and I think that fun comes through. ",positive
" I saw this in the theater and I instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video. I am a big nut for Sci-Fi action flicks though anyway.

Maybe they will make a sequel? :) 8 out of 10 ",positive
" Eric Stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident. While learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition Joel befriends slick fast-talking charming womanizer Raymond (an amazing Wesley Snipes) and boorish surly racist biker Bloss (a terrific William Forsythe) who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he's forced to share a room with. Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving but married girlfriend Anna (radiantly played by Helen Hunt). But he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own. This remarkable movie's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through. Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script) and Micheal Steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste wit and warmth specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one's lifestyle including and especially your sex life (this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when Joel and Anna try and fail to make love in a motel room). Besides the expected poignancy the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw earthy humor that's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with Joel and Bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club. The uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus: Stoltz Snipes Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding with stand-out supporting turns by Grace Zabriskie as Bloss' doting amiable mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospital nurses. Despite the grim subject matter the film ultimately proves to be a very moving positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit. A simply wonderful little gem of a drama. ",positive
" This is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism (of heterosexuals). The film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very believable as Gerald/Geraldine and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting. The directing of Christopher Monger is very sensitively treating such a difficult issue quite excellently packed into a good story. Not a big movie neither an art film but a little lovely motion picture! ",positive
" I think that people are under estimating this incredible film. People are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep. Which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1/10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have Stephanie beaton. This is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film. The general view on this movie is that it has bad acting a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this. But i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece...that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining.

" I bought this a year or more ago for $2 (yep $2) left it on the shelf for ages now watching DVDs while holed up with a cold. This is a haunting movie. Brilliant performances by all involved especially the 6yo boy (about the only smiles you get in this movie). Plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever Grosse Pointe Blank but obviously that's lighthearted this is heavy hearted. As a psychologist a clinical and forensic psychologist a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary stuff! Brilliant work all round. Pete ",positive
" A film destined to be on late-night TV long after the present instant money-makers have long been forgotten. Perhaps a little too subtle for today's youngsters but in time they'll grow into an appreciation of this movie. ",positive
" I love this movie. I mean the story may not be the best but the dancing most certainly makes up for it. You get to know a little bit about each character the way THEY want you to learn about them. I just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into Broadway... ",positive
" It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last 2 years (I've seen the premier in Tel-Aviv Israel in the summer of 2006 exactly when the last war has began...) This problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesn't matter who- boys and girls straight and gays Jews and Arabs... I've seen the Bubble already 3 times and it still surprising and exciting me- each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem... The last time i saw it- was with my friend who is a Christian Arab and it was on the independence day of Israel ( the most symbolic i could ! how ironic) and... he cried in the end!!! - if he's been touched and wasn't embarrassed- everyone would be touched by The Bubble!

" This was the first televised episode of the Columbo series (although it was filmed after Death Lends a Hand )and it heralded one of the most successful TV series in history. Jack Cassidy (who played the murderer in the series three times) enthuses smugness arrogance and self-assuredness in equal measure here as Ken Franklin one half of a mystery writing team who hatches an elaborate plot to kill off his partner Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to terminate their professional relationship leaving Franklin exposed as merely a good publicist rather than a prolific writer. The initial murder set-up is fantastic and Cassidy's performance facilitates an arguable accolade that he was the best Columbo murderer in the series. Peter Falk is wonderfully understated in his role as Columbo and the character's inherent traits and oddities which are underlined by a seeming slowness and absent-mindedness contrast particularly well with Cassidy's character's extreme smugness: one of their early scenes together where Ken Franklin fabricates a motive for the killing through Jim Ferris's non-existent expo-see of identifying hit-men operating in the underworld exemplifies this very well. Franklin hints to Columbo this potential motive and Columbo (purposely or ignorantly) fails to latch on forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a markedly patronising manner and compare him unfavourably with the detective in the books Mrs. Melville. Also noteworthy is the early directorial contribution of 24 year old Steven Spielberg. Notwithstanding some elementary inclusions of cameras shadowing the actors and actresses he adds some stylish and elaborate touches to uphold the general professionalism of the episode. One particularly stark image is of Jim Feriss's dead body lying on the settee almost dark in the foreground as Ken Franklin raises a glass to him in the background after he finishes answering a phone call to Ferris's distraught wife. I have no doubt that working to a restrictive 10-14 day schedule Spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated. Unfortunately the event of the second murder necessitated by a blackmailing scheme which is plotted by a female friend of Franklin's (and ironically referred to as sloppy by Columbo in his climatic summing up) takes the steam out of the whole thing. The cutting edge of the plot is compromised and the screen-time between Falk and Cassidy inexcusably lessens at this point to perhaps help the script-writer (Stephen Bocho) out of a tight corner since he cannot singularly develop the story without another murder. The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial banter and exchange of words between Falk and Cassidy is strongly and effectively executed but it merely advertises the fact that it should have happened more in the episode. The main aggravation lies with the sealing clue (if it can be called a clue): Cassidy's character's hitherto smugness and arrogance is amazingly expelled by a clue that really does little to imply his guilt; and once this is mentioned he capitulates in a rather unspectacular and uncharacteristic fashion. All in all a bold opening to the series which inevitably advertises and foretells all that is good about Columbo and conversely the problems associated with such ingenuity i.e maintaining the high standards and particularly creating a credible and suitably intelligent ending.

" Keep in mind I'm a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time. How I've overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me. To me this is a better film then the much lauded High Noon . It's a great western with excellent acting and a great story. The DVD is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography. If you like westerns or James Stewart this film is not to be missed. ",positive
" This is undeniably the scariest game I've ever played. It's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which I usually don't care much for) but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects ( Scryeeee scryeeee.. ) and above all incredible atmosphere. I love the Scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past. The only game I've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a great horror fan escpecially of Clive Barker's stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short?)

" Excellent movie a realistic picture of contemporary Finland touching and profound. One of the best Finnish films ever made. Captures marvelously the everyday life in a Central Finland small town people's desires and weaknesses joys and sorrows. The bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society. Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film Eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in Joki. ",positive
" It is Queen Victoria's misfortune to be defined as an historical figure according to her relationships with men.Shortly after she succeeded to the throne she came under the influence of her Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to the extent that she became known as Mrs Melbourne .After the death of her beloved husband Albert she was referred to as The Widow at Windsor and years later a long friendship with her Scottish ghillie John Brown earned her the nickname Mrs Brown .Such is the price women paid in a patriarchal society. The reality is somewhat different and Young Victoria goes some way towards putting the record straight depicting the queen as an intelligent and independent young woman conscious of the inequities in her society and at her court. Courts have always been hotbeds of seething jealousy plotting and counter-plotting naked ambition and sometimes outright murder. As an 18 year old innocent Victoria ascended to her uncle's throne thus initiating a positive orgy of intrigue and a power-struggle between Prime minister Lord Melbourne and his rival Sir Robert Peel. Lord Melbourne cuts a dash in the Old Public School Man kind of way with his finely-honed cynicism and his well-polished gems of advice. Hardly surprising then that the young queen finds herself in awe of him and even perhaps a little in love an awe that he ruthlessly exploits drawing a fine line between attempted seduction and attempted sedition as he forces his policies through against Victoria's better judgement. Into the arena rides Prince Albert on a mission from King Leopold of Belgium keen on political rapprochement between Great Britain and the rest of Europe. At first a reluctant suitor he soon falls in love with the English queen and palliates the influence of the politicians and courtiers. The Young Victoria is a beautifully photographed brilliantly-scored and very sumptuous movie.I note that it has been criticised in some quarters for this sumptuousness as if a movie about 19th century English Royalty should somehow have shown the Empress of India and her family living in rags in a filthy workhouse........I don't think so. I must single out the remarkable Miss Emily Blunt whose beauty reminded me of the young Princess Margaret's.Hers is obviously the pivotal role and she has absolutely no trouble in dominating the film despite strong performances from Mr Jim Broadbent Miss Miranda Richardson and Miss Harriet Walter all immeasurably more experienced. The music is suitably regal and forms a cohesive part of the whole movie without being in any way obtrusive. The fact that Britan flourished more under its two great queens Elizabeth the First and Victoria than at any other time is a matter Feminists might like to make more of but I suspect like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher really powerful women make them feel uncomfortable.If you can work out why there might be a Ph.D . in it.

" In Holland a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (by imagining she's a boy). He plans to leave the next day but gets a look at a picture of Christine's hunky boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay to have a try at him. Then things get strange. A big X-rated art house hit in the US in 1983. Why was it X rated? Let's see...there's strangulation full frontal male and female nudity castration mutilation simulated sex a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!! Paul Verhoeven made this after Spetters . Spetters was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash. So Verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it. He was right! Critics loved the film not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still it's a great film. It's beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there's so much symbolism and obvious hidden layers in the dialogue that you're never bored. All the acting is great--Krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but (somehow) has you rooting for him; Soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection--the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body--he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with Krabbe in the crypt. This is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! A 10 all the way. ",positive
" Yeah the poster is quite a horrible piece of work. I thought the movie was OK...nothing really outstanding...I just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life. Ahh but that can't happen to rich kids now can it? Not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion. No...the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed. After all who will drive the brand new SUV and who will go to law school? Ah the poor little rich kids...in their quaint pretty house with their ivy league schools ultra clean homes and socialite parties...what will the world do without them? I hope they all get addicted to drugs pass-away their life and end up in jail...so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world.

" The latest film by the Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty. Whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male-prostitute Villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco. The three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis. The cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the Spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow Spaniard Pedro Almodovar's work with themes dealing with sexual desire both heterosexual and homosexual. An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic gritty realism opposed to Almodovar's use of surrealism although both styles are similar. The piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing. ",positive
" Well-made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert writer/director Pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! The acting is uniformly excellent however; despite their relatively young age Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this day. I have 3 more of Pialat's films in my VHS To Watch pile albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact but also LOULOU'S oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - I can't say that I'm in any particular hurry to check them out now...

" In Iran women are not admitted to soccer games. Officially it's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it is about sexism. Women are lower forms of human beings. Some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage until the police will come and pick them up. Despite the insane situation this is a film with lots of humor. It's also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression. You'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs. Good job by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a heroic comedy. ",positive
" This is so exciting! After I saw La Roue this afternoon a short light-hearted little movie I consider this one a real treat! This is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures I saw this year. It is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the 30's to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema. It's simply filled with music and an adorable mood that's really upbeat and bottom line it made me happy! Obviously it wouldn't be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that I didn't even think of it twice. The comedy is many times hilarious and I think it is even superior to the Marx Brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time. This is rather perfect. ",positive
" The mystery here is why this delightful small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves. Simply showcasing the budding talent of Audrey Tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti. Lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations itÕs rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and unlike some of itsÕ more critically acclaimed competition in the genre such as The Taste of Others it actually entertains.

" Here's a real weirdo for you. It starts out with another take-off on the PSYCHO shower scene on campus then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for Spring Break. The trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal Sheriff Dean. One of the college cuties wanders into the woods witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open. Then it's lets-rip-off MACON COUNTY LINE-time as Dean stalks traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one. Tony March is on-target as the evil shotgun-happy Dean. The movie's overall tone is truly disturbing. The ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film; it's also a study in despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes misogynists and nihilists the world over. ",positive
" Unlike other commenters who have commented on this movie's ability to transcend race contrarily I think that this powerful film provides a complex and deep story that addresses institutional racism and the effects thereof. Washington directs Fisher's story with a careful hand and critical eye relinquishing this cinematic endeavor neither to dismemberment of women's bodies perpetuating unthoughtful stereotypes nor satisfying the expectation of the white gaze. I think this film might be a bit too happy in the end; however it is deeply entrenched in Afro-American culture and discourse to the point that some white spectators may get the feeling of looking into the life of this Afro-American--Antwone Fisher. I have problems with the Naval aspect of the film but when we look at America there are not many choices or opportunities for black men who are/were in Fisher's situation or similar situations. Viewers may go to this movie expecting a Black Movie: what is a Black Movie? Do stereotypes of pimps whores drug dealers single parent homes and so forth constitute a Black Movie? I think Washington as director recognized that Afro-Americans and other people of color deal with human problems like abuse and displaced aggression to name a few. These problems have--historically and presently--only been given light and validity via Good Will Hunting and other white movies; it's high time they were given the same recognition and validity as their white counterparts in and out of the media. Sad to say though in this racist country Denzel Washington and Derek Luke will probably have to wait another ten years before they receive an Oscar or anything else. They both will have to wait until they direct or star in a movie that perpetuates the usual racist and sexist stereotypes to get an Oscar. That is to say Denzel deserved awards for Malcolm X Hurricane and others before that jive Training Day Oscar. That is not to negate or push aside other great actresses and actors of color who are denied their due praise for ingenious work. Yet Hollywood would rather send the message that racism and sexism and heterosexism are acceptable by perpetuating and even rewarding those stereotypes as they appear in countless films such as American Beauty Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil American Pie and even Gone with the Wind. Derek Luke is a helluva actor and I wish him best. All of the other actresses and actors gave superb performances hands down although I do take issue with Denzel's selection of yet another straight-haired light-skinned sistuh. That said everyone should watch this film. However it may not be for everyone. Much Luv. 10/10 ",positive
" I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a major disappointment. Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey '60s. It's politics too upfront and ridiculous. And let's face it I was still under a love-spell known as BLOWUP : and I still haven't completely shaken it. Now the love is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and oh well . . . Good Luck to me! But time marches on and time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher to me. I revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age. And ZP is it's own experience and is only really linked to BLOWUP through its creator the late great Mr. Antonioni. Twelve years ago I had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print projected at its correct size (immense) restored by an Italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape. To this day I remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness. And indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of place . What is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own. I remember the second time around seeing it --- the early 80s --- I had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular. Whereas before these two seemed like a smart-alecky shadow version of Zefferelli's Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet)they now were engaging me --- particularly The Girl in her insistent slo-motion-ality. She-took-her-time . . . To Live. Everything EVERYTHING dies around her. Upon exciting the theater the daylight of Reality quickly began to erase my new found enjoyment . The encroaching shoulder-padded big haired 80s whispered But that's a hippie fantasy --- let it go The force of Antonioni's vision had I had realised already worked itself inside of me the FIRST time around so I answered 80s with an Uh-Huh and guarded my love secretly possessively and jealously. But this then is what good art does it lives inside of you and if you wish it has its way and loves you back: secretly jealously and possessively. And you get changed . Was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in its March lineup. Undoubtedly ZP must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment. But hey sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all. Today reality hit ZP has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of ALICE'S RESTAURANT. So it is still too difficult too disturbing too what ? Maybe it's that as with all good art it Lives while everything dies around it. Peace. ",positive
" This movie is more Lupin then most especially coming from Funimation. Other then the bad dub it isn't bad. The first hour is a lot like the Comic (which is what all Lupin the 3rd stuff is based on). Lupin's trying to get a huge treasure. Fujiko's using Lupin's weakness to women to try to get something out of it. The last bit isn't that bad he's with another women but of course Fujiko's still him number one. A lot of the other Lupin movies are more Family with cuss words then Lupin. Any good Lupin fan I think will be pleasantly surprised (I know I was after hearing so many bad things about this movie). It might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits (they make it a little mushy) but overall it isn't a bad film. Good enough to be one of the few I'd watch again of the Lupin III movies. ",positive
" Galaxy Express 999 (Ginga tetsudô Three-Nine). Made in 1979. Directed by Rintaro. Based on the original work by Leiji Matsumoto. What little I know of the history of GALAXY EXPRESS 999 it was first published as a popular manga in 1970's and was created by Leiji Matsumoto. GE999 is set in the same Star Wars-type of space universe as Matsumoto's other famous space manga: CAPTAIN HARLOCK. In fact space pirate Harlock and other characters from that manga (including Queen Emeraldas and Tochirô Oyama) make appearances in GE999. GE999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes. It was aired in 1978. A year later came this anime film which isn't a sequel to the series but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie. The story is set in unidentified Star Wars-type of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility. People of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years maybe even forever. The protagonist Tetsurô Hoshino is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel Count Mecha whose entire body is made of mechanical parts kills Tetsurô's mother. Tetsurô swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body. To obtain it he must travel to a far-away planet with space train Galaxy Express 999. However since Tetsurô comes from poverty he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket. By a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman Maetel who bears a resemblance to his dead mother. Maetel offers a ticket for Tetsurô on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey. And so the journey begins I first saw this film last October about six months from now and again yesterday. I feel that I must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film: it seems very rushed. Then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series? Whatever the case the situations change with a fast speed and Tetsurô meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance. I feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes. However there's no arguing that GE999 has deserved its place as an anime classic. The animation itself very faithful to the style of Matsumoto's manga is detailed and beautiful to watch. Even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become out of date but puts many later anime films in shame. The music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat old these day (it was the 70's after all). I have not heard any English dub of this film so I can only comment the Japanese audio which is good. Voice actors give life to their characters most memorable ones being Masako Nozawa (mainly known as the voice of Goku through out the entire Dragon Ball saga) as the excited and young Tetsurô and Masako Ikeda as the calm and mysterious Maetel. The supporting characters are not left in shadows but also have a life of their own most memorable to me being waitress Claire. The story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours as well as for those who try to find deeper messages. GE999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as Tetsurô's journey from boyhood to manhood. The whole film is told from his point of view so we are forced to feel what he feels. I think many people can relate to Tetsurô for despite the fantasy elements he is a very realistic character: young hot headed awkward and naive. We follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not. Maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end when she reveals who and what she really is it doesn't much answer to anything. Maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man always close but just out of reach. It's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between Tetsurô and Maetel that still awakes talking and questions and fascinates after the decades. People have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends of mother and son or of two possible lovers (which wakes a lot of critique since Maetel's age is unknown and Tetsurô hasn't even reached his puberty yet). Without any means to sound deep I think the best term to describe them is soul mates . There is no question that the two feel devotion caring and love for each others yet it goes beyond that of friendship family and lovers. I think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters. The ending scene even if you already know what is going to happen is still very touching and memorable. All in all despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes GALAXY EXPRESS 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like Katsuhiro Otomo's AKIRA (1988) and Mamoru Oshii's GHOST IN THE SHELL (1995). The film is directed by Rintaro who had previous experience of Leiji Matsumoto's works as he had worked in CAPTAIN HARLOCK series. Later Rinatro directed a wonderful looking METROPOLIS (2001) that also questions the difference between humans and machines. GALAXY EXPRESS 999 (1979) is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan. ",positive
" Okay. Yes this was a very-tight-budget movie with continuity errors (like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together) and as much as I love Nick Mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt-out part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad (plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very likable. Mancuso had some great lines while Nancy Allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting. Classic? No. Bad parts? Yes. Entertaining? Big yes. I would have loved to have been on-set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle Grieco would have. Are you fast? ... Y'ain't THAT fast.  ",positive
" I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and unbelievable. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of Claude Rains who as usual is the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar but he is in the good company of Chaplin Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films. See it and enjoy him. ",positive
" Let's Bowl started out on local television in the Twin Cities. It came on late at night something you'd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of Hamm's. Even the ads were locally produced featuring Wally outside Grumpy's Bar holding a microphone and stammering nervously -- Ahh...over to you Steve Sedahl. Not sure why but that one always made me laugh. There was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips. Sedahl played it straight counter-balanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious Wally Hotvedt. Highlights included segments like How to Properly Dispose of an Old Bowling Ball (chuck them into a lake) and Tips on Dating where the duo date a couple of hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint I could have done that myself! Another segment -- what the duo did on their days off -- featured Steve in beer can strewn hovel pigging out from the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over-sized headphones. Hilarious! Wally's awestruck comments about league bowlers and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights. Let's Bowl was picked up by Comedy Central and had some good moments but the network never really knew what to do with it running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling competition which was never the point of the show. The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters (Ernie the Pig Butch etc.) were more distractions than anything else. The whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced. Even Jon Stewart dissed Let's Bowl on the Daily Show -- (not enough lame snide jokes?) -- an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better. How often does a Let's Bowl come along in the world of modern television a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap? The networks have the total crap part down cold but it's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark strange funny little gem like Let's Bowl. Here's hoping they'll put it out on DVD. ",positive
" I saw this gem of a film at Cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight. Welcome to Collinwood is nothing short of superb. Great fun throughout with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off. It's a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook (Cosimo played by Luis Guzman) who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison. While in prison he meets a `lifer' who tells him of `the ultimate bellini'  which to you and me  is a sure-fire get rich quick scheme. It turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop  which could net millions. Sounds simple?  well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride!!  word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on Cosimos `bellini' lead by failed boxer Pero (Superbly played by Sam Rockwell  surely a star in the making) and reluctant crook Riley (William H. Macy) who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud!!. Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna street) which also inspired a similar film to `Collinwood'  `Palookaville'. This knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the Russo brothers it definitely has shades of the Coen Brothers about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker. ",positive
" Fifteen years later and Paris Is Burning is still aflame. This is a classic in black gay films right up there with the other honorary black gay films The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This seminal work captures underground and underclass (i.e. underserved) black and Latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since including all the sentimental Harlem Rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings. They're good but this is the best (dare I say the only real ) film you'll find on the subject. It's Relentlessy Cunty (the classic house music invention)comes to Hollywood non-stop hilarious camp (like only we do it) and dead-on social critique. All this by a white female director (who obviously must have been a Sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in a former life.) I could go on but I think you get the point by now: I love this movie! ",positive
" I wasn't alive in the 60's so I can't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience. There are some excellent performances most notably by Josh Hamilton (of With Honors) Jerry O'Connell (Sliders) who play brothers divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich a character actor who has been long ignored by many gives a heart-filled performance as their strict father who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam but returns empty inside while the other is exactly the opposite. All in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film that I hope everyone gets a chance to experience. ",positive
" I have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of Spirit. The best thing about the movie I think is that the animals isn't able to talk this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so 10/10 from the kids and me ",positive
" I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie is in the same niche genre as Away from Her - or even The Bucket List but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all. The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit. Throughout the course of the movie we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias why she favors one son over the other how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! This isn't a feel good movie but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect they are there for a reason... Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel. ",positive
" This is a clever episode of TWILIGHT ZONE that was comic rather than strange or tragic. Buster Keaton is Woodrow Mulligan a janitor from 1890 America works in a laboratory. He is constantly griping about the life problems around him: meat is too expensive (it's like $1.00 / lb. Unheard of!). He is always yelling after crazy speeders (on bicycles - autos haven't appeared yet). Griping to the end he sees a helmet like device by a scientist and puts it on and tries it. Suddenly he is in modern America. The beginning was a seven minute silent film. Now it is all noise all talking all beeping all blowing. Keaton is here only a few minutes when he realizes that the world has changed and not for the better. He runs into Stanley Adams a Professor Rollo who realizes that Mulligan is from c. 1890 (he mentions President Cleveland). Rollo has always wanted to live in that charming quiet age. He helps Mulligan get the helmet repaired and they go back in time. Rollo gets bored after awhile due to the lack of scientific equipment that he can use. Mulligan puts the helmet on him and sends him into the future. But now Woodrow is fully content with the quiet simple age he lives in. He has found contentment. In his last fifteen years Buster Keaton was frequently on television (many times for Allan Funt on CANDID CAMERA where he could help set up sight gag tricks on the public). He did make a few films as well (most notably A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM and THE RAILRODDER). But he occasionally popped up in television plays and episodes. He is in his element here presumably advising the director (old comedy film director Norman McLeod - he directed the Marx Brothers in HORSE FEATHERS) on the tricks he could do. Watch how Stanley Adams and he time Adams picking him up when he is snatching a pair of trousers he needs. In terms of timing it reminds one of gags he did in the 20s in films like SHERLOCK JR. The episode does show Keaton in fine fettle for a man in his sixties. The appearances of Jesse White (here as a repairman of all things) is always welcome. But look a bit at Professor Rollo . Stanley Adams was a well known figure in movies and television from the 1950s onward to his tragic suicide in 1977. Plump with unkempt appearance and heavy booming voice his best known dramatic role was as the wrestling promoter in the film version of REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT (he wants Anthony Quinn to be a wrestler wearing a costume as an Indian). His best known television appearance was as the space trader who introduces the crew of the Starship Enterprise in STAR TREK to those furry fertile little creatures Tribbles (as in The Trouble With ). Adams was always worth watching (like Jesse White and certainly like Keaton) enhancing most of the productions he appeared in. I have never understood his suicide but it was a sad end to a first rate character performer. ",positive
" All of the people reviewing this film and probably many professional film reviewers just don't get it. This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about I suggest you get any of Zeman's films such as The Fabulous World of Jules Verne Baron Munchausen Journey to the Beginning of Time or On The Comet. If you are unable to locate a film then read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If one were to look at Zeman's work and try to compare it to any of the other sci/fi fantasy films of the time viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either. It is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day because both Zemen and Hines do not compute . They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only. If you look at this film from a perspective where you KNOW that he intentionally tried to create a pastiche collage of mattes mixed with live action you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job. It isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow. I thought that the creatures were also quite good also considering how they were made. Hines took a great gamble and I think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come. Someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual CG work. Regarding the actors I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book in that many of Zemen's actors were somewhat expressionless at first but became much more engaging as the film and action went on. It is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library. I will watch it for years to come all three great hours of it. ",positive
" Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. The Dream Team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A great plot. A great twist. A great eye candy. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest movies apart from Scream and A Nightmare on Elm Street . This could be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams) a struggling hotel manager boards a late Red Eye back to LA. Little does she know that she has been followed by Jackson Ripner AKA Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. Later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the Secreteary of Homeland Security who is staying in Lisa's hotel. And what does this have to with Lisa. Well she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him if she doesn't Ripner will murder her father (Brian Cox). The twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it. Overall definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005. Definitely worth the see. 3 1/2 out of 4 stars ",positive
" To put it simply I enjoyed this film. The reason for my interest & enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject matter itself. I had heard tales from my mother and grandmother about how Northern England working class life and attitudes used to be (as experienced by them)and this is an interesting depiction that seems to faithfully represent what they told me. In particular the paternalistic but overbearing father who knows what is best for his family along with his stubborness when this paradigm is challenged. (Not much has changed there then!!) People who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the film because the story does not easily transfer across the different media. In a sense however the film is an historical document and I personally enjoyed it if only because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon. ",positive
" the only word that sums up this movie is quirky. it's a light-hearted romp through an existential concept. bouncy (in more way than one) and a bit nutty. i wouldn't exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn't seem quite as memorable as the director's first movie cube but it's a good pit of fluff to watch on a Sunday morning. the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that's how it was to be written. done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension. a little like the matrix meets head meets human nature . 6.8 out of ten ",positive
" I am currently on vacation in Israel for summer and so was able to see this incredible film. A bit of a warning before I begin writing: I speak fluent Hebrew and so the Hebrew parts were no problem; however about a quarter (a bit less) of the film is in Arabic and I was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit. This did not detract from my understanding of the film but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater. After a year of American Cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest; yet The Bubble surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting witty dialogue and relevant political climate. The film opens on a checkpoint on the Israeli-Palestinian border; For the first few moments we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on. Yet this is an important element of this film's strength. The political situation and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background. Most importantly Tel Aviv serves as a character of its own in this film. It is constantly referenced. Street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged. The skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly and ultimately the city evolves along with the film The film focuses on the love between Noam (Ohad Knoller) and a Palestinian immigrant Ashraf(Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) with the societies of Tel Aviv and Palestine serving as a constant foil. We always know that their relationship is forbidden and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema. The love is incredibly strong and stands as the centerpiece of the film. The secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong: flamboyant restaurant owner Yelli's ( Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) relationship with the ultra-butch and grating golani solider Golan (Zohar Liba) is particularly a source of amusement. The love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite fine crafted works of art and the cinematography is astounding: In the first love scene of the film the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and dissolves into a shot of Noam and Ashraf. This shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love. To give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate so I will instead focus on the witty dialogue. Even when watching this movie in my second language I could not stop laughing throughout. Lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven and an analogy of Sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber. This dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in Cinema. The music used in the film is also particularly powerful. Music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other. Little elements like this truly elevate the film. I could not give greater recommendation to a film; this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted. ",positive
" H.G. Wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by. He was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour. At the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species natural biology on one side and Marxism market economy on the other side were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number. The weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite. He defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race. First of all the non-Caucasian with the only exception of the Jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages. Then within the Caucasian community all those who were not healthy the alcoholics the mentally disabled all those who were genetically disabled etc. That was not Hitler. That was H.G. Wells and that was not after the first world war. That was more than ten years before. And twenty years before the first world war he had published The Time Machine that defended the idea that the human race left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth would see the differentiation of the human race into two species : the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species. The point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators. Wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy. The first countries to follow this injunction were the Scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them. The film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election no parliament no really democratic institution only peace imposed by military conquest and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors. And in that future world all absolutely all human beings are Caucasians. Wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036. Amazing. Wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all. The last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets. Frightening. And that was produced in 1936. All the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of Hitlerism fascism Japanese imperialism or Stalinism can be found. But it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of H.G. Wells. We are obviously very far away from the Brave New World of absolute democratic social selection or the Animal Farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of Big Brother. This vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others. And I only want to compare Wells with the British science fiction writers of his days. It would be unfair to go beyond. This reveals that in England in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals: the fear that the future would only be somber bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind.

" Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character this was Classic H:LOTS. The characters outside of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) were true to form and the reunion scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen. Homicide: The Movie aka Life Everlasting is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it. True to Homicide form there were no happy endings such is life. That's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter cop shows left on television. Kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike. ** I call myself a Homicidal Maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood. ** ",positive
" Russell my fav is gorgeous in this film. But more than that the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I replay their scenes over and over again. Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people. All characters are cast and portrayed excellently. ",positive

" When I was a kid it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller was Tarzan and I wouldn't understand why since I saw a couple of Weismuller's last films in the character and I thought he was sort of out of shape. It wasn't after many years that I came across Tarzan and His Mate and then I understood. Weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other Tarzans such as Barker Gordon Scott Jock Mahoney Denny Miller Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. As for this film I was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan a strong self minded active and no-inhibitions woman as Jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made (Tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused; one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it); such behaviors were unthinkable with the Janes to come such as Brenda Joyce Vanessa Brown Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the African jungle. O'Sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of Tarzan himself except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily; the combination is perfect. Another highlight in the movie is Cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later Tarzan pictures where she often saves the day. Tarzan and His Mate stands as a fine product in its genre (Tarzan films) and perhaps as the best though I have to admit that I also enjoyed Tarzan's Greatest Adventure (1959) made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast (and in spite of the just acceptable Gordon Scott in the leading role with his too perfect all gymnasium physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man). Good for Jane and her mate! ",positive
" Although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my DVD rack and i don't know why. I think i like it because the moral of the story is 'television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life'. For those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book its nothing like the film at all. To ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded Richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building killing himself everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time. I read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9/11. ",positive
" I remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to Graceland it all came flooding back. Why this hasn't had a Video or DVD release yet? It's sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been. In fact this is the one John Carpenter film that hasn't been released. In fact i haven't seen it on the TV either since the day i watched it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role he was born to play. John carpenter's break from horror brought this gem that i'd love the TV to play again. It is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes. Belting out most of Elvis's greatest hits with gusto. I think this also was the film that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies (Escape from New York The Thing Big trouble in little china and Escape from L.A. Someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has. If this doesn't get released then we are gonna be in Heartbreak Hotel. ",positive
" This is a really interesting movie. It is an action movie with comedy mixed in. Foxx teams up with comedian Epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin. It will keep you wondering whats going to happen to Foxx next. It was a well shot movie the director used the right colors in this movie(dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feel. Kimberly Elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing it you haven't seen it. It's definitely worth having if you are a Jamie Foxx fan. It deserves more credit than it is actually given. ",positive
" Such a masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is everything that a follow-up should be. It does not tread on the toes of its predecessor preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality. The Man From Snowy River II is based upon the return of Jim Craig to the Snowy River country after a three year absence. The film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century of Australian history legend and horses. The storyline demonstrates a touch of Hollywood in lighter shades an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is far more vibrant than the first film and much more showy with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film yet The Man From Snowy River II possesses every essential characteristic of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography a stunning focus of the Australian high country the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland which equals the first in every way. Geoff Burrowes has done a superb job with this film and it is highly worthy of recognition especially with regard to the quality of the Australian Film Industry. The lead cast from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton and a well-replaced Brian Dennehy carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film. As far as sequels can go The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again. ",positive
" Five years on from the Tenko survivors returning home and from Marion's double-edged Well that's that . It's now 1950: reunion time. The gang's all here: Marion Bea Ulrica Kate Dorothy Christina Dominica and latecomers Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is a beaut: as perfectly written and acted and as thought-provoking and moving as the original series. All the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here. From Marion's family to Joss's health centre everything has changed in five years and not everything has changed for the best. A trip to Dominica's plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge-of-the-seat tension. There's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as once again fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colours and there are some shout-at-the-telly moments of drama. Lush location filming in Singapore and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. It's such a shame that this really is the end. I could watch it all over again. Perfection. ",positive
" I saw the description of the movie on TCM and only let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith so I was delightfully surprised to find that I really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional. Of course it is seriously dated but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can watch it more often. I also was quite taken with the performances of Smith and Ustinov as the leads and of Karl Malden Bob Newhart and the cameo appearances by Robert Morley and Cesar Romero. ",positive
" The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently has his act together) and Hank (clearly doesn't have his act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family. This film delivers. This is a layered full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing. As a crime drama / thriller I would happily compare it to 'No Country For Old Men.' While both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills 'Devil' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace. 'No Country' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire while 'Devil' is a bit more enjoyable. There is definitely less violence in 'Devil' than 'No Country.' The acting delivers as well. Ethan Hawke sometimes wooden in the past brings the jitters sweating and the deer-in-the-headlights-look to the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Andy has the film's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor who you believe can do anything. There's really not much wrong with this film. It jumps back and forth without being confusing. Events spiral out of control but the film never does - the writing (from first timer Kelly Masterson) directing (veteran Sidney Lumet) and the editing stay as tight as a drum. In many categories this is award caliber stuff though maybe films like 'The Departed' and 'No Country' squeezed this one out of the limelight. If you liked those you'll like this. ",positive
" Well I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's best film. The plot the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent. In this film Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer. Due to this he became wanted by the police. Later on Salina (Brigitte Lin) who was the secretary of the crime lord went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan. However the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her. Later on Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen defeating them one by one. At the last scene Chan was seen punching the crime lord. Lastly this is the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should watch it. Highly recommended. ",positive
" A movie/documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they are doing and maybe more what they are not doing. The tempo is very quiet......so you have to relax.......breathe in...breathe out before you see it......

If you survive the movie you can start to look at your neighbors and think...maybe they are like the persons in the movie...i bet theres a lot of them out there......sick...crazy people living with a nice facade........after seing the movie i feel its more interesting to look at my neighbors........

" I've seen a lot of TV movies in my time as a student the majority the normal waste of time that US television throws out. This one however was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end. Having only seen Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate I was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from A-B that he normally gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after quite a long time dating back to The Fly II. Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme in a leading role again. I can't say that I ever take Jane Leeves seriously after her Benny Hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role. All in all a highly recommended film. ",positive
" Citizen X tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed The Rostov Ripper This great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer. The film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over 12 years. (Possibly over 50 victims mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as the lead detective and Donald Sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb. Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case. This a film not to be missed. It debuted I believe on HBO and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding. Great film ",positive
" I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto. This film was sort of a consolation when I thought I wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice. Well I was totally blown away. By the time I got to the theater I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes I actually forgot who was even in it.) Terrific performances from the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly I think not since Chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever. The kids were also great. Definitely check this one out if you get the chance. And by the way I got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better. ",positive

" Telefilms tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule which is why this film always tends to buck the trend. George C. Scott embodies Ebenezer Scrooge perfectly fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies and still makes him a simpathetic character. The production value for this film was exceptional never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set-ups yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops. A movie that certainly stands alone. ",positive
" This was excellent. Touching action-packed and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering and people who learn that there is a time for fighting a need to defend. I cried laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story. Good writing job for an action flick and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. The ending wasn't twisty but it was still excellent. If you like escape from New York or rooting for the underdog this movie is for you. Not an undue amount of gore or violence it was not difficult to watch in that respect. Something for everyone.

" Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on almost too many to fit into one review like this but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties maybe even in all of contemporary cinema to be observant not about love per-say so much as it's about a human connection. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna and on the way there start to talking about things at first arbitrary then personal (Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town' in Vienna until his plane the next morning. Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance and in a sense is about the act of having conversations of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. Here it's often about relationships and commitments as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential or seemingly so and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves or what weren't really loves of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (I loved the bit about the quakers in the church) and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for that last part but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives. Meanwhile it's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s Generation-X mode but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other where sweet asides are actually acceptable ( I have to tell you a secret Jessie says and then leans in for a kiss ho-ho) or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. I loved the scene with the poet where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share but really are seeing them do it first-hand. All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future... Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness however self-contained as it may lead into something more. Who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone if only for less than 24 hours and be that much more attached than a married couple? This is perhaps Linklater's thesis but there's more to it than just that. It's a very dense film and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend.

" FULL HOUSE in my opinion is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure if I've never seen every episode but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) get married. If you want to know how what made it so funny you'd have to have seen it for yourself. It was a two-parter so you'd have to have seen both parts. Another one of my favorite episodes is where Jesse Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) get locked in a gas station on Michelle's birthday. You'd also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened. I have many other ones that I like too. Everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well-designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion even though it can be seen in syndication now I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good. ",positive
" The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the other being the more well-known GRIFTERS) AFTER DARK has all of Thompson's hallmarks: dangerous women the confidence game and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being or not as harmless. Jason Patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story) and the too-little-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a great performance. But Bruce Dern is the film's secret weapon: his sweet-talking grifter Uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes. there's almost no comic relief in this film so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void.

" This is a run-of-the-mill nature porn movie. By porn I don't mean sex. I mean gratuitous images of (for example) thousands of birds together or hundreds of walruses or a giant waterfall or iceberg. Several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the film. There is almost no plot in this film. Told to expect a story of three animal families better than March of the Penguins the movie simply doesn't deliver. The blame rests in three key areas: (1) the writers who gave James Earl Jones some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history (2) the music team who over-dramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling even when the film fails to motivate and lastly but most importantly (3) the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason no continuity no flow sucking the life out of the entire film -- a film about life. When we got to the whales halfway through the film I sunk back in my seat with dread hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through and that I'd be able to survive the long endurance test along with the animals on screen. There was also almost no science in the film at all. They attributed hot and cold (all of it not just the seasons) solely to the Earth's tilt ignoring the fact that we'd have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm. And it would be worst if we had no rotation (relative to revolution) like Mercury because half the planet would bake and the other half would freeze. Then near the end they used the phrase humans and animals as if humans are not animals somehow exempt from the laws of nature. So much for science. I must credit the camera work however and again that is why I call this nature porn. Everything from super-slow-motion to what appears to be a finely-tuned mechanically-controlled time-lapse photography was put to use to provide some (and I caution only some ) stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films. That said I am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen. Some of the shots showing the great watering hole in Africa as it changed from season to season seemed like CGI to me. A director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it's all natural but they didn't do that. For a film about Earth I had expected a lot more of Earth to be shown. What we saw was pristine. We had to take the narrator's word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes. They didn't show us evidence of it. They didn't show us Alberta's poisonous tailing ponds visible from space. They didn't show us the great Pacific trash whorl. They didn't show us a nighttime picture of human light pollution around the planet. These are as much Earth as anything else. Why cover it up for a feel-good whitewash? My last criticism of the content is of predation. Any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey the music turned almost into that Mt Doom scene from Lord of the Rings with the predator portrayed as some kind of Sauron ultimate-evil character. But predators aren't evil. They perform a necessary service ensuring that the best members of the prey species survive. We are predators ourselves. Any time the predator caught the prey we immediately cut away to something else to sort of pretend that death and eating don't really happen. The final insult was the dad polar bear being left to die after he dared to try to eat. Bad bear! Bad! you can almost hear them say. On to the presentation itself. My theatre may be in part to blame for this but maybe not. I had expected to see something with greater clarity than I could see on my own HDTV LCD at home. But the picture was blurry and was presented in the same 16:9 ratio I could get at home instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days. And during one action-packed scene near the end the film (I can't imagine this happening digitally from how it looked) was damaged and we lost several of the colors eventually blacking out completely. That repeated about three times. If they actually do plant a tree on my behalf it will have been worth it. But how will I know? ",positive
" Finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen. Well we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will spiral downward towards destruction since where else is there to go but down but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie. Hoffman is superb as usual and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself. Hawke might have been a little out of his element but he played the part well enough. Add into this mix Andy's wife played perfectly by Marisa Tomei cheating with Hank; Andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery. This movie will get you thinking. ",positive
" This is a great movie for all ages. Its the story about three animals how have to find their way home. There is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie. You never know what is going to happen next. This movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. You just don't know what going to happen next. The trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes. They producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too. The animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors/actress themselves. Everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 the whole way! Rent or buy it today I can guarantee you will love it the whole family will! ",positive
" Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema taking very creative directors editors and photographers and working on historic themes what the Japanese call period pieces . Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color photography and editing. Brilliant even. The new wave of Japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture but not really explored in Kurosawa's samurai epics or the Zaitochi series. Another fine example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would place director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave Japanese directors. Other recent Japanese period pieces I would highly recommend include Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003). ",positive
" Laurence Olivier Merle Oberon Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes star in The Divorce of Lady X a 1938 comedy based on a play. Olivier plays a young barrister Everard Logan who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the London fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home. The next day a friend of his Lord Mere (Richardson) announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel and he wants to divorce her. Believing the woman to be Oberon Olivier panics. Oberon who is single and the granddaughter of a judge pretends that she's the lady in question Lady Mere when she's really Leslie Steele. We've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time. With this cast it's delightful. I mean Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon that great team in Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight nervous barrister. Oberon gives her role the right light touch. She looks extremely young here fuller in the face with Jean Harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her. She wears some beautiful street clothes though her first gown looks like a birthday cake and in one gown she tries on with that hair-do she's ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is delightful as the real Lady Mere. The color in this is a mess and as others have mentioned it could really use a restoration. Definitely worth seeing. ",positive
" Anna (Charlotte Burke) develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation. A bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field. Lacking in detail much like any child drawing the house and it's inhabitant Marc (who can't walk because Anna didn't draw him any legs) are inhabitants of this purgatory/limbo world. Anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure what's what and in the process tries to help save the boy but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her but trap her and Marc there forever. Wow! Is a good word to sum up Bernard Rose's brilliantly haunting and poetic Paperhouse. A film that is so simple that it's damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget. While you may find this puppy in your horror section it's anything but. It's more of a serious fantasy expertly directed and exceptionally well acted by it's cast in particular Charlotte Burke and Elliot Speirs (Marc). And yet it's not a children's movie either but meant to make us remember those carefree days of old that are now just dark memories. Rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with. Paperhouse stays away from trying to explain it's more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination. There's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into. Paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind engrossing you with it's very own sense of reasoning. As the story unfolded I was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. Bernard Rose's visuals are brilliant here. He's able to create an unnervingly bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface but as a whole is much greater than the sum of it's parts. The acting is of young Charlotte Burke in this her feature debut is a truly impressing as well. Unfortunately she's not graced the screen since. A much deserved Burnout Central award only seems proper for that performance. Toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there but I was easily able to overlook it. I wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect. The movie as is is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover. It's a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised. ",positive
" If you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a RAF Lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of May 1945 is somewhat unlikely since German air defences were as lively as Adolph Hitler on that day but this isn't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and I guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy . In fact you'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect beauty and soul of Powell and Pressburger's masterpiece . The scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today ? Again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made . RAF bomber command lost 58 000 men during the war the same number that America lost in 'Nam but during a shorter period and a far far smaller pool of active combatants there's no atheists in a fox hole and I doubt if you'd lost a relative during the conflict you'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing . When Richar Attenborough's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didn't survive the war . Also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939-45 there seems to be very few people from Germany passing through the pearly gates . it's obvious Nazis don't go to heaven The plot itself where dashing young pilot Peter Carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext you see A MATTER OR LIFE AND DEATH is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the British empire as it's replaced by American ambitions . There's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of American history and culture . One is the ethnic mix of America even today many Britons think that the USA is overwhelmingly composed of White Anglo Saxon Protestants when in fact only 51% of Americans are White European . The film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess I am an American as Peter is judged by Abraham Farlan an Anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by British forces in The American War Of Independence . As for the special relationship between Britain and America - What special relationship ? Powell and Pressburger know their history when it comes to Britain and America . They obviously know their future too So remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present . It's strange beautiful poignant and clever but most of all it's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years . Can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a British soldier killed in Iraq ? ",positive
" I am a huge John Denver fan. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and later release. The later release is missing several songs though. I see that it has been released this year with all original songs. To my surprise I found the original CD for sale at $75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas Cd would be worth that much. To me no amount is worth selling this treasure. It is my favorite Christmas CD. I have never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would love to have either version. If anyone has one available please let me know. Thanks ",positive
" Ya. That is what I think. Sure it was still a great show with John in it but I personally think that it is way better without. I love having C.J. and Grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together. When John was still around I really didn't laugh as much as I do now. It is too bad that no more are being made. ( I don't think...) because I would love to see some new material. My favorite character must be Rory. poor Rory is almost always left out. It is always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT RORY!!!??? Honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it. I almost guarantee you will laugh. well even chuckle. ",positive
" Maybe Presque Rien is not the best movie ever made... But it is better than many of you have said. I still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one. You Americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies with a clear beginning development and outcome. But European movies are less narrative but makes you think much and feel. Many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie.. The purpose of this one is not show us a simple summer loving movie with commercial characters who fall in love and live happy forever . Summer Holidays and beach are only a background and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys. Maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie because of its 3 parts showed as flashbacks. These 3 moments are: - Summertime in Pornichet when they meet and love. - After a year and half living together in Nantes Mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself. He tries to suicide taking something and Cedric brings him to hospital. Later he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that. - The last part is when Mathieu come back to Pornichet in winter alone.. to think about how his life have changed how his life become to be and trying to find himself. It's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well because all the scenes are mixed among them. But anyway as I said before... this is not a funny movie. If what someone want to see is meat for that we have Belami movies. Presque Rien what want to show us is how cruel can be the life for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life. Mathieu only wants to go away from home and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness.. But what seemed perfect at the beginning.. later is not as good as he thought and he become troubled and feel that he has lost the way of his life. He is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy. He finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide. So funny? Is not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? only a few.. but this is not a movie for entertainment. Is all about feelings... friendship love happiness unhappiness pain depression loneliness... I as many others feel identified with life and problems of Mathieu and that is what director wanted to do.. a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life. For me the best homo-themed movie ever. ",positive
" Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait I happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning. First Pachelbel's Canon brought a lump to my throat then the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather my father and I have all flown) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowe's name hooked me completely. I was entranced by this film Crowe's performance (again) the subject matter (and yes what a debt we owe) how various matters were addressed and dealt with the flying sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons too) the story - and as another contributor pointed out Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I won't spoil the film for anyone but separated from my wife by 4 000-odd miles as an ex-army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot I admit to crying heartily a couple of times. Buy it rent it download it beg borrow or steal it - but watch it. PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colours)on the ground? Looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin-.303 Brownings in a dorsal turret. ",positive
" I just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago and I was very happy with the movie when I left it. It's very intense and the closest I've come to crying in a movie in quite some time. That is a credit to Adam Sandler who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels and who probably deserves an Oscar nom for it were it not coming out so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to Adam's disturbed. There is some humor but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments as Adam deals with his loss and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays two levels very well... when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable but when he is well less stable he's powerful and dark. I recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss. ",positive
" A delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way. Cinema after all is a visual media and Igor used its full potential. A young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind. In one of the compartments he meets with a girl. Words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations. The two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words. ",positive

" I'm a bit conflicted over this. The show is on one hand awful the acting is terrible (even when we get actual name actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in one episode) the dialogue is moronic and the premise/moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short. There's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes and Robert Englund's cameos are short pointless and corny in a sort of a Bob Saget on America's Funniest Home Videos kind of way. On the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television. The 80s fashions the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of The View at all times the premises lend the material more to self-parody than scares so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his SAT's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a substandard mom (her husband is played by Brad Pit) another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially-retarded twin another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step-dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house. The list goes on and on. Being that these are dreams I suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience. You have characters dressed like something out of a 80s-themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point (typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it). If you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away. If you're looking on the other hand for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever. Watch it. Its been showing on Chiller TV lately (pretty much every day) and I've been watching earlier out of morbid curiosity and now just so I can get a good laugh in each day. With Arrested Development and Extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now. ",positive

" The Notorious Bettie Page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of America. Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America. The type of modeling Bettie Page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a U.S Senate investigation in the 1950s. Walking out of the film all I could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s. You can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot that the footage questioned in The Notorious Bettie Page seems almost childlike and innocent. Most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when Bettie Page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals. I find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today's pornography it was very tastefully done. To be honest I was pretty impressed with The Notorious Bettie Page I found the film to be very well done and interesting. The movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America. Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very fine performance. I also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s. My only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been. I looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival. Also the ending was pretty tame and I was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Page's life where the film left off. Those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid the acting was great especially Gretchen and the writing was good. Mary Harron who directed American Psycho which is one of my favorite films is the director and writer of The Notorious Bettie Page. I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like Psycho Bettie Page is a character study and a fine one at that. Harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters. She is a very talented director who I hope will be around for many years to come. Bottom Line: The Notorious Bettie Page is definitely worth a look. It's a very interesting story that shows how far America as well as the world has come in terms of pornography. The film also provides a fine performance by Gretchen Mol who literally nails the role of Bettie Page on the head. And top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands. Sadly this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but I think it's worth checking out. MovieManMenzel's final rating for The Notorious Bettie Page is a 8/10. It's an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in American history. ",positive
" Everyone plays their part pretty well in this little nice movie . Belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better. The movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have not the ones we do not or cannot have. If U can get this movie on video for around $10 it´d be an investment!

" When you see the cover of the DVD you're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie a film made for $1 000 in somebody's backyard. Wrong! This is quality material and really good. It's a comedy and a clever one at that. It also is very touching in spots with a nice spot of kindness. The production values are very good (this looks excellent) the actors are known the film's direction and sets are great. It's amazing. Who would have thought? Carrie-Ann Moss playing against-type is terrific as Helen Robinson the June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie Fido; Tim Blake Nelson ( Mr. Theopolis ) is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend Tammy and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are excellent too K'Sun Ray as young Timmy Robinson shouldn't be overlooked either. In fact he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone. If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. You'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very very pleasant surprise. You need a dark sense of humor though; an appreciation of the absurd. ",positive
" I highly recommend this film. Set in the Bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 Paris it is in most respect a classic film noir script: lady in peril sister trying to find her honest cop fighting everyone. Luckily it avoids being stereotypical and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting innovative visuals. The film might remind you of Sin City in look but it has an even sharper even more graphic novel look that I found really compelling. Each frame each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer. In terms of story and artwork you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations. Make any excuse you need to see this film. ",positive
" A bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching. A wheelchair-bound young woman Jane Hatchard(Helena Bonham Carter)is teamed with a reluctant caregiver Richard(Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent dying Jane who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills. Wheelchair-bound and full of spirit her last dying wish is to loose her virginity. She offers herself to Richard who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role Carter has a certain charisma and likability. ",positive
" This is a fantastic series first and foremost. It is very well done and very interesting. As a huge WWII buff I had learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds comparatively speaking that is. It is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the narrating by Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about WWII but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. Especially with the information about Soviet Union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. That information is now different we now know because of the fall of the USSR. Overall a fascinating look at WWII and a must see for any serious WWII historian professional or personal alike. ",positive
" This was my second time watching the film (via the French-language version as opposed to the first which was dubbed in Italian) and I feel that it improves on subsequent viewings. A compelling if slowly built-up character study that's beautifully shot and with the Parisian settings being equally impressive. In the long run it's not top-grade Polanski and I would rank it at number 9 in his filmography but it's still a confident mix of subtle chills and surprisingly often broad comedy. It also features a fine cast all of whom are in good form but especially Isabelle Adjani Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. Even so I'm a bit baffled by the sudden compulsion for Trelkovsky to 'change' into the previous tenant; apart from the owner of the café opposite the apartment building where he is given whatever Simone used to have without asking him if he wished any different there is little to indicate (as far as I could discern anyway) that this is what everybody wanted of him! Okay so he found Simone's belongings still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her (even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously)? Following his nightmarish visions in the bathroom the last section of the film (where Adjani all but disappears) is almost anti-climactic - especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants witness his attempted suicide as if it were a night at the Opera a concept which had already been used 46 years earlier by Jean Cocteau in THE BLOOD OF A POET (1930)! The ending then is at once predictable and unresolved: just what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out of the window?!; I remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well and I'm sorry to say it's no clearer now! Mind you the film's first two-thirds are pretty solid but I wish that Polanski had been less reliant on obscure plot points throughout. ",positive
" As B movies go it was well above average (I warn the reader now that I may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie although I am trying to minimise any such tendency). As sequels usually go it was utterly fantastic(despite a cookie cutter approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum. Despite this sometimes tedious tendency it seemed to work in this particular film so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original Scanners ). The movie was similar in ways to the Superman series in terms of the main character's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents (who seemed modelled along the same lines as the Kents in the Superman stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero possessed of extraordinary powers from an early age etc. The depiction of profound feelings of alienation of prodigious or otherwise non-conforming children adolescents and/or adults was a theme which reminded me of films such as Real Genius and (to a more superficial degree) Doctor Mordrid and struck a particularly strong chord. The film had a positive message and was fun to watch. I found some of the insights and accuracy (in terms of depiction of certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating and even profoundly touching at times. These moments occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula-driven schlock and gratuitous sex(uality in this case as the sexual elements were tastefully done) and violence that makes B movies (or Shakespearian plays for that matter!) so much fun to watch! This is a must watch for all comic book Sci-fi remote viewing enthusiasts and horror fans! With the right exposure in the right circles the film could develop quite a cult following along with the original Scanners . ",positive
" My baby sitter was a fan so I saw many of the older episodes while growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo so I'm not sure why I left the TV on when this show premiered. To my surprise I found it enjoyable. To me Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters *dodges tomatoes from fans of the others* so I like that they only focus on those two. However this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it. I like the voice acting especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked listening to him even before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi sounds to me like he's really enjoying his job as an actor. I also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or act out scenes from Star Wars (not called by those names in the show of course).

" I understand this film to be a debut feature and as such it is very impressive. It has the feel and pacing of a true indie yet director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional. The shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts. It's a story that needs Judd Hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working. Judd is fantastic as usual; as are Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise though is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach. Anyway I found the film refreshing and entertaining. ",positive
" But how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can't win. For George Knox it is not easy. As the movie opens Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) are riding on thier bikes around the angels' stadium. When they return to thier foster mother's home Roger is suprised to have a visit from his dad (Dermot Mulroney). His mom is dead! And when he asks his father when they going to be a family again he father jokes I say when the angels win the division championship So later on Roger and J.P hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball.

" As a kid I thought this movie was great. It had animals it had beautiful music and it had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now I still love this movie for different reasons. It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. It has beautiful well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme that still makes me cry. Even when people hum it. And it has my favorite actor Michael J. Fox. Based on a book this is the story of three house pets an intelligent overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog Chance. The three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. Dismayed and worried the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. A truly incredible journey. So what maybe home IS just over that mountain. But what if it isn't? I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters and for anyone else that ... yeah everyone go watch it. ",positive
" This movie was highly entertaining. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well. The score is also uplifting and dramatic. The movie is made from a mix of traditional animation combined with computer generated images. The result is truly stunning. I watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it. The story is compelling and well narrated. I don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7. Definately a keeper in my household. ",positive
" Gorgeous Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast a television reporter who travels with her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang California to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full. So they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). Wouldn't you know it Ernest and meek partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) are hiding a big secret in their cellar: pitiable deformed diaper-clad Junior (Stephen Furst in a remarkable performance) who ultimately terrorizes the girls. A deliciously unhinged Lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie. It builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour. The hotel and the foreboding cellar - large echoes of Psycho here - are great settings. Most of all the perverse plot involves incest and patricide allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality. And yet it also becomes poignant as we realize Junior is no one-dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls. The final shot is especially sad. The Unseen is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery. 8/10 ",positive
" This is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy. It's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own. The cat is named Sassy and she lives up to her name. Chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound. Shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things. Put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time. There are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all. It's the best talking animal movie that I've seen so far. It's a really good movie for families. ",positive

" Lily Mars a smalltown girl living in Indiana dreams of making it big on Broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her but he just gets annoyed with her antics. When Thornway goes back to New York to stage his show Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show only as a favor to her family however Thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms which makes the show's leading lady Isabel Rekay jealous. When Isabel gets fed up with the John-Lily romance causing friction with the show she leaves and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play which also may jeopardize the romance. Very charming film and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedic touches into her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth while supposed to be humorous never threatened her singing career) I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornway) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than be the romantic. The film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together but a very enjoyable film. Rating 7. ",positive
" The Mother tells of a recently widowed mid-60's mother of two adult children (Reid) who on the heels of her husband's death finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover. The film dwells on the quietly passive Mom her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover and the convolutions arising therefrom. A somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents The Mother does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism. Will play best with more mature audiences possibly women who may better empathize with the central character her needs and issues. (B+) ",positive
" Does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by George Ede aka Father Fitzpatrick in the move It had to be you? He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving? If not I will have to rent the movie. This was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! I met my one true love (my Soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I had least expecting it I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship. Altho we did marry I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought I would. I got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years. He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry & in disbelief about the way it turned out. I had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years. This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love. I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick rang true for me. I know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarry. Don't EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED! IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE. Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL! This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for if it is meant to be it will no matter what IT WILL HAPPEN! Nothing is impossible even when it's the second time around! Thanks! ",positive
" James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. When one reads Deliverance one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the Deep South. When one watches John Boorman's film version of the book one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narration. The characters are fully realized and the portrayals are fantastic. I first saw this movie in 1992 after my freshman year of college. I was in a phase where I was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973. Among them were Patton Papillon and All the President's Men ; fine films all of them. This one was easily the class of the group. That says a lot. ",positive
" Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates in micro which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall as an example that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace). Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance with great wisdom Solomon describes in these words: The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you. Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint the tainted sister of Stephen whose sin driven by loneliness spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic powers cognitive and mediumistic this hardened woman loyal to his blunt conservative husband is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. Every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation like Stephen Jr. the bastard child of Senator who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. The film moves the bowels we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that against all life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August.

" Still the definitive program about the Second World War The World At War isn't just long but also very informative. The series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.) and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. Most episodes are about the war in Europe and there are several episodes about the war in the Pacific. Other episodes include information about the wars in Africa Burma the Atlantic and the home fronts of Germany Great Britain United States and Soviet Union. There is one episode that's dedicated to the Holocaust. The series starts off with the episode A New Germany (1933-1939) and tells about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. The series ends with the episode Remember; the war's influence in a post-war world. Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. Every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. The credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. There are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. Each episode is like a mini-film. The footage is fantastic and so is the way it was put together. In addition some of the footage is in color. The information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining. The series was produced by Jeremy Isaacs for Thames Television (UK). Commissioned in 1969 it took four years to produce such was the depth of its research. The series was narrated by Laurence Olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). The series interviewed leading members of the Allied and Axis campaigns including eyewitness accounts by civilians enlisted men officers and politicians amongst them Albert Speer Karl Donitz Jimmy Stewart Bill Mauldin Curtis LeMay Lord Mountbatten Alger Hiss Toshikazu Kase Arthur Harris Charles Sweeney Paul Tibbets Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose. Jeremy Isaacs says in The Making of The World at War that he sought to interview not necessarily the surviving big names but their aides and assistants. The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed according to Isaacs was Heinrich Himmler's adjutant Karl Wolff. The latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in Himmler's presence. The World At War is often considered to be the definitive television history of the Second World War. Some consider it the finest example of the documentary form. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 voted for by industry professionals The World at War ranked 19th. The program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war. After watching a few episodes I liked the series so much that I tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other. I've seen some of them several times. There are two other great documentary series that I know of that may be of interest to the viewer. One is called The Great War (1964) that's about World War I. The other is called Cold War (1998) that's about the Cold War obviously. ",positive
" I'm going to review the 2 films as a whole because I feel that is how it should be considered and watched. When I talk about 'the film' I am talking about parts 1 & 2 together when watched one after the other as they should be. Thank you Jon Anderson Steven Soderbergh & Benicio Del Toro. This film is a refreshing bold gritty and true film. And it hearkens a new style of film making. No Faux drama. No Swelling sound track. Not Faux Documentary style. Just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts. I have been reading Jon Anderson's Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life and recently finished Fidel's Auto biography and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly. But I have to say that it is Jon Anderson's exhaustive penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone. Anderson was consultant on this film (or these 2 films). What makes this film a true thing is that it is clean. No swelling music or slow-motion photography to heighten drama and even more importantly; no fake documentary shaky camera. Just square shots and straight forward shooting style. The type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle. Benicio Del Toro should be given full honors for this I never doubted him as Che throughout the film... not once. He did a wonderful job and I will respect him for ever for this. Some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole. But I think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film: it doesn't try to be everything. It doesn't try to 'tell the story'. A person's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2 4 8 16 or 32 hours. This is one of the subtle beauties of this film it resists that temptation and stays focused on the intent of letting us GET A FEEL FOR CHE HIS DEVELOPING MILITARISTIC MIND AND THE FORCES AROUND HIM. It focuses on 3 slices of time: The Battle to over throw Batista Che's U.N. speech and the Gorilla preparations in Bolivia. Motorcycle Diaries already told his young man side and I applaud S. Soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead. I keep referring to Jon Anderson's book and the film stays true. The only weak link for me are the casting (not the performance) of Matt Damon. In a film so loaded with true to life performances an American (Matt Damon) playing a Bolivian is a clunky stretch - he does well but after so much care in the casting this was an over-site. Small and completely forgiven. The reality that the rest of the casting gives you and most notably Benicio Del Toro's amazing job put's this film at the top of my list. The fact that this film went almost straight to video say's something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the 'revolutionized Cuba' to become what it might have are still at work keeping it's story quiet. If not out of clandestine muffling then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic. This is a must see film and Jon Anderson's Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess moves of the 40's 50's & 60's that placed unfair pressure on our South American neighbors and the effects it fostered.

" This sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting incredible photography good story. It is often compared to Braveheart because both movies take place in historical Scotland. Even though I love Braveheart I think this is the better of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil despicable characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose another dislikeable character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose who inherited his title has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining it should appeal to all. It has romance action beautiful scenery and has a exciting plot. One of my favorite films. ",positive
" When this movie first came out back in 1984 Prince was one of the hottest acts around. Everyone wanted to see this movie which was not much more than a extended music video. The acting was pretty bad but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time? Despite that it was still a very entertaining film! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all time classic comedy especially their rendition of The Password which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their who's on first baseball routine. Appolina (who went by a single name then) provided some beautiful breasts so you had the brief nudity covered. Plus she is very attractive. And of course the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded. Prince later on had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name but at this particular time in his career he was at the top of his game. This movie doesn't rank in the all time great category but it is pretty entertaining. ",positive
" I hate those stories that begin with a funeral but I'm afraid this one begins the day we buried George. Not that we buried him. In the interests of the environment we had him incinerated. So speaks Elizabeth (Judi Dench) George's widow. She's led a comfortable predictable life with George. She has two grown children and a 12-year-old grandchild. But when she was 15 and in school in the midst of World War II she played the sax at night in an all-girl (almost all-girl) band called The Blonde Bombshells. The 'almost was because the drummer was Patrick a charming rogue who had no desire to fight and possibly be killed. With a yellow wig a long red dress and makeup Patrick looked almost as good as the others. One afternoon after the funeral Elizabeth finds herself in the attic of her home playing the sax she had put away. She used to practice but only when George was out of the house on the golf course. Then two things happen. Her granddaughter amazed at how good Elizabeth is starts talking about how the Blonde Bombshells could be reunited and play at her school dance. Then Elizabeth encounters Patrick (Ian Holm) now just as much an aging oldster as Elizabeth and just as much attracted to her as he was more than 50 years ago. (He also was attracted to all the other members of the Bombshells. The roses that would appear on his bass drum had a special meaning that attested to his affection.) Well why not see if the other band members can be located and why not give it a shot for a reunion performance at her granddaughter's school? Why not? One member of the band is gaga. One is dead. One is in jail. One has found salvation with the Salvation Army. One they can find no trace of. One is last known to be in the States. One is a professional singer and has no intention of doing a school gig even for a reunion. But one by one Elizabeth and Patrick bring together the surviving members of the Bombshells. We don't know if enough of them can be found. The rehearsals more often than not turn into off-key shambles. While they do this we share Elizabeth's flashbacks of what life was like when she and Patrick were young in war-time London playing in the band while the bombs were falling. As terrible as it was it was the most exciting time of their lives. When the night of Elizabeth's granddaughter's dance arrives of course the Blonde Bombshells filled with jitters and renewed friendship blow the youngsters away. Afterwards Elizabeth informs us that the Bombshells are continuing to play at gigs and that she and Patrick have no plans to get married...but see nothing wrong with a little fooling around. This is sentimental hogwash expertly done and not bad at all. What makes it work are the skill and charm of Judi Dench and Ian Holm. When I hear the term warm-hearted comedy I usually cringe unless the actors are first-rate. Dench and Holm are wonders to watch as they take something as light-weight and predictable as this script and turn it into something that charms us. Then there's the old broad gambit that's fun if you remember the old broads. Among the Blonde Bombshells are Leslie Caron Joan Sims Olympia Dukakis Billie Whitelaw and Cleo Laine. Laine sings three numbers and almost over-balances the production. She is so strong and unique a jazz talent that while she's singing the program nearly becomes the Cleo Laine Show. Another attractive feature is the number of great WWII songs played in strong swing. ",positive
" My cable TV has what's called the Arts channel which is a catch-as-catch-can situation sometimes sometimes films sometimes short clips of films or ballets and I came into this just as the bar scene came on where they tear up their coupons.

" During a Kurt Weill celebration in Brooklyn WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? was finally unearthed for a screening. It is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has Weill-Gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens. The score stands tall and a CD of the material with Gershwin and Weill only underscores its merits which are considerable. Yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and Fred MacMurray cannot quite grasp the material. Then too the 'modern' segment is weakly written. BUT the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work. As a World War II salute to our country's history - albeit in a 'never was' framework the film has its place in Hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits.

" In the immediate aftermath following World War II sound minds in Hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag-waving that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. Best Years of Our Lives' and even 'Gentleman's Agreement' investigated the way Americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war but Delmer Daves' Pride of the Marines beat them to it. The film is about Philadelphia smart alec John Garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole with Japanese soldiers eerily crying out at him and his buddies Mariiines tonight you die! he is blinded by a hand-grenade and dumps his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her after coming home. Delmer Daves is uncompromising in his depiction on these men who are brave as it were almost by coincidence. They are there in the foxhole and when shot at they react. So much for heroism but they get the job done. And then comes the self-pity the dark gloomy sense of humor. Garfield is in angry denial of his blindness and the film makes no excuses There's no free candy for anyone in this world as his buddy tells him. The same guy a Jew played by Dane Clark reminds him In a war somebody gets it and you're it. Everybody's got problems! When I get back some guys won't hire me because my name is Diamond . Great movies are made with guts like these and if the first half hour of 'Pride of the Marines' fails to rise to the occasion completely from then on it evolves into a true work of art. You weep and you ponder you ache and you hope against hope. Well simply: art. ",positive
" A few years ago I added a comment to the IMDB on The Real McCoys TV series. I said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show well-acted with wonderful characterizations. I recently saw on DVD four old episodes PLUS the Reunion of 2000 with Richard Crenna Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another writer here mentioned it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) weren't refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via SAG or AFTRA. The reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show. One piece of inside information we did NOT get was whether or not Kathy Nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left Luke a widow in it's last year which wasn't very good. Nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called Broadside about women nurses in the Pacific in WW II. Get it? BROADside? No not funny. Unlike the sleazy salacious and violent TRASH on TV now that is so undermining our values The Real McCoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings. And I thank all involved including the creator Irving Pinkus for having brought it to my family. We never missed it. ",positive
" What a fun movie! If you're a Giallo fan Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. To begin with it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent Bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life. The kill scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start. The killer The Red Queen is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers I've seen in an Italian movie. The 70s sets and fashions are wonderful. In fact all the visuals are interesting with the laughing Red Queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film. The convoluted plot held my interest throughout. Finally Bruno Nicolai's score may be the best I've heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable I haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days. The only two issues I have with Red Queen Kills 7 Times come in the film's finale. First the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot. If you've seen more than a couple Gialli you won't have any problem determining who is behind the killings. Second the ending feels a little too rushed and as a result is a bit confusing. I'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me but I'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all. A second viewing might just clear this up. ",positive
" Magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades. Like any really fine film it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming. I can't believe this film is SO difficult to find -- I'd buy it on DVD in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet. ",positive
" I thought this would be a sequel to the original 36th Chamber of Shaolin but actually it's more of a light-hearted sister to the original. Gordon Liu still stars as a would-be hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those pesky Manchus... but this time around it's lighter and more comedic. The film centres around the local dye mill where wages are cut due to the hiring of 10 new Manchurian bosses. Liu plays Chao who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk possessing almost magical kung fu skill. But his luck runs out he is exposed as a fraud and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the Shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect them. The comedy really begins at the monastery where Chao makes several bungling attempts to get accepted. This sets up lots of really funny moments and lots of great fight choreography. Continuing in the 36th Chamber tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting (and supremely hokey) training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden benches as weapons. Also unique and of note is the blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building. Chao is not accepted as a student at Shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffolding for the 10 year restoration of the monastery. On the DVD I bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold building and the inspiration that director Lau Kar-Leung drew from it. This is a craft many hundreds (perhaps thousands) of years old and in Hong Kong scaffolding is still built of bamboo even on large high-rises though the West exclusively uses steel tubes and clamps. As a result of his scaffolding work Chao develops a special style of kung fu... when asked what kind it is he hilariously replies scaffolding kung fu!! which he first tests during a dust-up with the monastery's Abbot. In the final confrontation with the Manchus there is a dazzling array of creative uses for bamboo poles and ties. From a comedy perspective I think it's one of the best of the kung fu genre. As a kung fu film in general it also stands out... I recommend it to anyone! ",positive
" Shore Leave is mostly an average Star Trek adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode though. I simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans. It is lightweight entertaining nothing more. However I'm glad to see that a TV show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode Kirk decides to grant his crew some time off and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. As usual the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be. There are some action and tense moments but most of the story is played for laughs. Good but unexceptional. ",positive
" I'll admit to being biased when I reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series. I saw this film for the first time in ~2005 on the late night Fear Friday on AMC which often pulls obscure gems like this out of cold storage for new generations. I made it a point to watch the entire Amicus anthology series before reviewing any of them here to make sure I had perspective. Looking back I still rate The House That Dripped Blood as my favorite followed closely by Tales From The Crypt and then Asylum. I think all of the elements that make this series charming---the vintage '60s/'70s style cinematography creepy to kooky far-fetched tales and the utter Britishness of it all right down the backing music----came together better here than any of the others overall. The movie centers around a very old English country house and the misfortune that befalls all that dwell within. The first story involves a horror writer and his wife who moved into this secluded place to get a break from the city so he could concentrate on his passion. He creates a murderous character called Dominic and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction. There is a subtle physchedelia here via his torment that I found amusing yet creepy. Oh and those horrible prop teeth (then again these are British actors maybe those were REAL!!!) The second story is the tale of a lonely old man (Peter Cushing) that has moved here to escape his loneliness yet it only worsens as he is haunted by lost love. He seems to have found possible salvation at a local (very creepy) wax museum but it turns out he would have been much better off alone....... The third story includes the great Christopher Lee (my fav British horror actor) as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter. He is constantly wary of her getting into things she shouldn't---like witchcraft! She has a natural talent for it with good reason. Lee is superb here as the ice cold disciplinarian that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth!! But despite his best efforts the little troublemaker does in fact learn forbidden knowledge and bad things follow...... This final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he's working with isn't qualified to capture a proper vampire film right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular. So he goes to a old curiosity store in the middle of a foggy night to get something more authentic . Little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic vampire's cloak! Putting it on at the stroke of midnight has rather noticeable effects. By the time I had gotten to this fourth and final story it was after 3 am and I couldn't quite stay awake on the first try (not from boredom). But I did experience something that I have hundreds of times a curious bonding experience I have with films or music when I drift in and out of sleep and the film/music becomes part of my dream!! Great fun!! This bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because I woke up right when he was levitated by the cloak's power and couldn't quite comprehend was what happening at first. Not long after the lovely Ingrid Pitt a costar on his movie set came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight---but he needn't have bothered for she was a real vampire herself. The chintzy keyboard jingle that followed as she flew toward him on the staircase was simply hysterical!! And again in my half-asleep state seemed rather confusing! Side Note: Make sure to catch Lee and Pitt along with the stunning Amicus star Britt Ekland in the all time classic film The Wicker Man (1973). The weakest link here was the interlacing commentary between stories but based on the stories themselves this is a classic! Objectively I would say the third story is best but I like the 4th most because it makes me smile so much.Very highly recommended for horror fans and if you're a British horror fan it's mandatory! I'd say it's worthwhile to view the series in chronological order if you can. The last film of this series Monster Club (1980) is certainly the weakest. I think the first 3-4 films except for the at times mediocre Torture Garden (1967) are the best but if you like any of them you should watch them all at least once. You'll probably be back many more times to watch your favorites. ",positive
" I like this presentation - I have read Bleak House and I know it is so difficult to present the entire book as it should be and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they did a very good show with the staged Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg and I could see the pain of Lady Dedlock even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I am sorry I think she is the best Lady Dedlock... I am not sure who could have made a better Jarndyce but I am OK with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these long Dickens' books - Oliver Twist would be easier - this is a long and if you don't care for all the legal situations can be dreary or boring. I think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring. I just LOVED Mr. Smallweed - it can be entertaining. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart here... I think we should be given a chance to judge for ourselves... I have to say I loved the show. Maybe if I read the book again as I usually do after seeing the movie maybe I can be more critical. In the meantime - I think it is a good presentation. ",positive
" Noll's comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with expletives to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing. There is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues using more language than necessary. This guy should never have been given a Thesaurus. Cut to Noll and you know you're in for a treat! The way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a lost era . Nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care. The use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done. ",positive
" I recently found a copy for $5 at a video store and snapped it up eagerly. While the music and (obviously) graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series Beyond the Mind's Eye I am still entranced by one segment: Stanley and Stella in Breaking the Ice . The music is brilliant and the emotions feel real. The clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music unfortunately. ",positive
" I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. I would have to say it was worth the effort. However you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes. If you don't have the staying power get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights. Now to the film what I say will contain spoilers and if you don't mind here goes: Alexandre is a promiscuous bum a womanizer and a gigolo. He lives with an older woman called Marie. Marie owns a retail shop and she provides for Alex. Alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had previously impregnated Gilberte whom he used to live with. Gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because Alex had abused and battered her. At this point Alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out Gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else. By chance Alexandre meets a nurse nymph called Veronika and they striked up a relationship. Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika struggles for Alex's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot. Finally at the end it's revealed Veronika is pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asked her to marry him. We assume (as aforesaid with Gilberte's situation) Alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family. There is hope! With the title of La Maman et la putain I deduce Jean Eustache was relating to Françoise Lebrun's character of Veronika. She was a whore and then she became the mother. Hence the mother and whore is the same person? Anyway what do I know! French films are mostly (not all) very chatty aimlessly political preaching theatrical insipid lamenting and full of quotes. Lebrun and Léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed. Not a bad effort. 7/10. ",positive
" First of all the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being altered . Well guess what? Peter Jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either. Well enough ranting. This is a very beautiful film. The backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and up to the battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers) and moves at a good pace. The voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like I imagined they would. Samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes but Aragorn looks AWESOME. The film has a great score that completely supports the movie. If you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading (the books are even better) give this movie a try keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago. Also of particular note: Peter Jackson's adaption of Fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as Ralph Bakshi's (Jackson has said many times how much he admired Bakshi's effort). ",positive
" Another fun witty frothy RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming film. While it lacks the stand-out great tunes of SWNG TIME (although the final number Face the music and dance is one of the team's best and rightfully so) it is hugely enjoyable as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930's. Once again the plot is lightweight and forgettable but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is sheer heaven. These two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene. While there are better Fred and Ginger musicals this is certainly a must-see. ",positive
" One is tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's movie as `event of the thought' following the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal storyline is a certain Bart Klever's torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality. The script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination. This film-monologue originated as a response to Fellini's `8 ½' and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary the paradoxical co-existence in two different galaxies: that of Guttenberg and that of MacLhuen. For some time we are apt to side with the script writer who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality (`man' `catholic' `window washer'). And together with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma: how can one eliminate from the future movie. Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator who is deeply immersed in work we realize that together with the main character we have again been `framed'. Really what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one's own name and the day-to-day care for the young daughter? So who is he this Bart Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like Frenhoffer from Balzac's masterpiece (just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves. ",positive
" I must say this movie has given me a dual personality. I've been told again and again to SHUT UP and start speaking like a normal person. But it's very hard... no not the wang. Did you find that disgusting and disrespectful? Well get in the mood for a lot more. This movie is just filthy! It's not a film to show your grand-parents but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your workplace. Anyway back to the voice mannerisms. Fortunately this site has some Ladies Man (did anyone at the studio notice that there's supposed to be a apostrophe(?) between the e and s?) so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops. I have a sheet in my wallet. ",positive
" Bleak House is hands down the finest adaptation of a Charles Dickens Novel ever put on screen. Alway one of My favorite novels I was exteremely pleased with this Television Mini Series. The late great Denholm Elliot was perfectly cast as the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story. over all a brilliant moving and atmosphereic film.

" I saw the movie and really could not stop my tears. Its tragedy that India has no such leaders after freedom who dare to do justice with their own children when they don't behave properly.. In current generation politicians bring their children's into politics without measuring their caliber and skills.. I remember the dialogue from Gandhi 'What kind of society we want to create/make with such people (about Harilal)?' No wonder that it will be a dream that India will hardly have such leader in this or next generation.. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi that 'After 50 years one would hardly believe that such person with body soul and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) had ever lived on this earth.' I sincerely want to THANKS a LOT to Anil kapoor Feroze khan and all film actors/actresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son. All father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles. ",positive
" This movie was charming. An accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success. What makes it work so well and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isn't about becoming Great it is simply about finding a way to express one's self. The big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest not the discovery of a whole new life style but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life. No one is discovering their passion they are finding their quiet soul. The Japanese background makes the subtle oppression and secret life of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal. We can all see ourselves in the everyman. ",positive
" This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that respect James J. Corbett was truly innovated. But getting back to the movie all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed she looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it's a period piece the story withstands the test of time; it has not gone stale. Ward Bond's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic well-staged and highly effective. That coupled with a great script makes this movie a must. ",positive
" Heh if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9 will you call me crazy? That's just to catch your attention. Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies who seem to only know the recent blockbusters. It's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies especially those with good artistic values. Dick Tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated in terms of technology. The negative reviews mainly complained about DT's messed up story. But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear and I had no problem following it. I didn't see the comic books yet I am not a huge US comic fan but I appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances. Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell. But if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together what would you expect. I had some scratches on my head and can't help but wonder did we really see the same movie? The title role although not as competent as it sounds still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences. Madonna was more express-less than breathless in her seductive role but added a lot of fun to the story. Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself. Apparently he's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles. We can see a hybrid of Scarface Michael Corleone Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh. And many thanks to make-ups. To me it's not bad at all. The surreal feeling really got me. ",positive
" You do not get more dark or tragic than Othello and this movie captures the play fairly well with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne's expresses to the viewer Othello's torment as he falls prey to Iago's lies very convincingly even providing a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello or the object of his wrath (it is not clear which since no motive for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they like Iago seem more crucial to the plot. I have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters even the seemingly unimportant ones very well. If I had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more. The director had a great cast and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film. I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests although you get a sense of this very late into the movie. Also Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their anguish is convincing the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met. On the other hand maybe the did just meet---like Romeo and Juliet. In brief: good performances too short. ",positive
" Brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve. Rather incredibly Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (original title which the producers discarded: God Against Everybody) got very low GPA (grade point average) in this website. It seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectators at large. Actually it is not so brutal. I mean as far as graphical violence is concerned. Its brutality is intrinsic as it portrays would-be lumpens I mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment who coldly perform murder orders in exchange of grana graúda . Is this post-modern man? Is his/her only worry a quick almost impersonal ultra permissive lay amidst over satiating meals ? The picture is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004 so far. Its shining editing style à la Godard its curious soundtrack counterpoints its more than efficient overall cast and above all its original narration with subtle non-chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue deserve at least an 8 mark.

" I just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable. It is a quiet little film that doesn't overwhelm you with special effects or big performances. It simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of North Carolina. Henry Thomas gives a good performance as Raymond Toker a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods. Toker's search for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester a slimy conman with an ulterior motive. And David plays the bad guy to perfection. There is much more to this film than first meets the eye. Filmed on location in North Carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music it is worth watching. ",positive
" Frankly this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors. The opposite of perdition (being lost) is salvation (being saved) and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts. The movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father-son relationship. It should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes. The premise is that the fathers in the move hit-man Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and his crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) love their sons and will do anything to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael witnessed it he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence witnesses. Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price even at the terribly high price of perdition. Rooney who in one scene curses the day Connor was born refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan and hires a contract killer named Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor on the Road to Perdition. For the rest of the movie accompanied by his surviving son young Michael Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney down the Road to Perdition and Maguire pursues Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a Church basement and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family Rooney says - Michael there are only murderers in this room .. and there's only one guarantee none of us will see Heaven. As the movie ends somewhat predictably one character is saved and one character repents. I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan but he does step out of character to play hit-man Sullivan convincingly giving a subtle and laconic performance. Newman does well as the old Irish gangster Rooney showing a hard edge in his face and manner his eyes haunted by Connor's misdeeds. Jude Law plays Maguire in a suitably creepy way. Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without affectation. The cinematography constantly played light off from darkness echoing the themes of salvation and perdition. The camera drew from a palette of greens and greys. The greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of Depression era Illinois. The greens belonged to the younger sons and that State's rural flatlands. Thomas Newman's lush sonorous and haunting music had faint Irish overtones and was played out in Copland-like arrangements. The sets were authentic mid-Western urban - factories churches. The homes shone with gleaming woodwork. The excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes distinctive acting and enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the screenplay y the movie's only nod to political correctness. I give this movie a10 out of 10; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film. ",positive
" This Batman movie isn't quite as good as Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero But it is still a good installment to the Batman cartoons I say it is equally good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for all the same reasons The storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it The Cartoon effects are good The voice of actors are really good such as Kevin Conroy as Batman/ Bruce Wayne Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Eli Marienthal as Robin. The villains are good such as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I am sure you will not be disappointed with batman Mystery of The Batwomen. So make sure that you rent or buy batman Mystery of The Batwoman the movie because it is really good. Overall score: ******* out of ********** *** out of ***** ",positive

" This was different that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about oddballs. William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight in this farce about superhero-wannabees. The most outrageous was played by Paul Reubens of Pee Wee Herman fame. There is lots of humor garish colors and no lulls. It's a pretty entertaining lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters all of whom want to be heroes a la Superman Batman Spiderman you name. They have talents in strange areas however that the real heroes don't (and don't want to!). It's silly but you know that going on. It's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity. It's a long movie for one so hectic so taking a break here and there is okay. The language was tame so kids could enjoy this too. In fact I don't recall any swearing in here except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering What a dumb f---ing movie. I thought it was fun two hours but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks. ",positive
" This is a film i decided to go and see because I'm a huge fan of adult animation. I quite often find that when a film doesn't evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles. This film is certainly more about style than story. While i found the story interesting (a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime films) it was a bit hard to follow at times and didn't feel like it all came together as well as it could have. It definitely had a mixed sense of French Animation and Japanese Anime coming together. Whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer. Visually this film is a treat for the eyes and in that sense a work of art. If you like adult animation or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment. I would recommend it. All i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better ",positive
" I have loved this movie ever since it's debut in 1981! I have lost track of how many times I have seen it! It never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if i am feeling down. The three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know the entire script so when someone is watching it for the first time I have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it. I can't even narrow it down although Sir John's character probably gets the most memorable ones. The famous I'll alert the media when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless but the list is truly endless. The scene's at Arthur's soon to be fiancé's father's house are a scream particularly his interactions with the moose. Do yourself a favour and see this movie! ",positive
" One of several musicals about sailors on leave it is the usual sailor meets girl complications ensue sorted out happily kind of plot. It proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too. The dialogue is not as zippy as 'Top Hat' for example and Randolph Scott seems out of place. There are compensations. It has some of Irving Berlin's choicest songs including 'Let Yourself Go' 'I'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'. It has Fred and Ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here. They do a snappy tap dance a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance all in the same film! Great versatility and artistry. It also has Harriet Hilliard who is rather good in her role. She had a varied career becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she is touching without being sentimental.Her two songs are simply and effectively delivered. She makes a good contrast with Ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film. More tightening up have made the film even better. Pretty good though. ",positive
" There's a good reason that Walter Pidgeon is warning off Leslie Nielson and his crew from the relief ship stuff he dare not dream about. As Doctor Edward Morbius Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. Since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter Anne Francis. They are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the Krell. The records as deciphered by Pidgeon indicate the Krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. The machinery they left behind is still functioning. Maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion. I see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. The terms would change we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive courtesy of the enduring popularity of Star Trek. We might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship. It might look a lot more like the Starship Enterprise or the Ship from 2001 A Space Odyssey. It's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change. The story behind Forbidden Planet is a timeless one about mortal beings trying to play God. You can't write about Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical marvel put together by Pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the Krell was quite the hit back in the day. He got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the Robot from Lost In Space. His scenes with Earl Holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with Earl's request for some home spirits are very funny. Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar but lost to The Ten Commandments and the parting of the Red Sea. Forbidden Planet's bad luck to run up against a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille. Classicists among you will recognize Forbidden Planet as a futuristic reworking of The Tempest which when you think about it could have been Shakespeare's one venture into science fiction. My favorite among the cast is Warren Stevens who's sacrifice enables Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with. Never miss this one whenever it's broadcast. ",positive
" Olivier Kosentsev Richardson Coranado Zefferelli and Almerayeda have all directed Hamlet but Branagh's the only one who got it right. This is the only film of Hamlet that contains the full four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story. Not many directors could pull this off without boring their audience but Branagh's skillful use of bravora film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut out. Examples of this include Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo whos entire purpose in the film was to simply say yes my lord as Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as the grave digger Robin Williams as Osric Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as the actor. Branagh's performance of the Act 4 scene 4 soliloquy (Which again is usually cut out) is nothing short of c cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows. It is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding. Branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience. This is a must see for everyone who enjoy's good story telling brilliant acting and incredible direction. All of these part of William Shakespeares greatest triumph. ",positive
" If you're going to put on a play within the prison walls why not go for the top playwright William Shakespeare? And if you are going to choose your cast from a whole lot of criminals serving long sentences for the most heinous crimes you can be sure there will be plenty of time for rehearsals. In a Kentucky Correctional Prison a courageous project such as this was undertaken with amazing results. This film shows how it was all done.the casting.the rehearsals.the set and costumesand the final presentation of Shakespeare's play The Tempest. It had not occurred to me before but there is an analogy between the setting of the play and the correctional prison. In the play the ship-wrecked characters are confined to an island with no contact with the outside world. Prison life too is much like that. With a simple painted back drop of a surrounding seascape the characters in a most pleasing assortment of costumes bellow out their lines to an approving audience may be not quite as Shakespeare intended but with good heart and true sincerity for sure. More interesting than the play itself were the little cameos of each man behind his character. One inmate saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness another as a redemption of his sins. It was quite moving to see the men wipe away a tear as they spoke of murder shooting and strangulation. One had the feeling that they would all like to wind back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions. However (as someone said) the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future. At least the play gave temporary relief from the depressing thoughts of past events. The prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the play to take place. Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons might follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone stands to benefitnot only the Kentucky prison but the prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self esteem and be prepared for the day when they go out on parole.

" Excellent writing and wild cast. The tech is poor but it's obviously very low budget. Looks like they didn't cut the negative but had to release on a video output. In any case one of the most inventive comedies I've seen lately. The screenwriter in particular is fine. ",positive
" Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. Had me snifflin' like a baby as I left the theatre trying not to let anyone see. So when I saw it again now in '07 I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached. Thankfully this time I was at home. What I hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it was the technical brilliance of this movie. The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue. The camera work which seemed to place the viewer together with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground framing the street scene. The story itself & the characters - seedy sad & brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. Then again Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends. All these years later I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is one hell of a great movie. ",positive
" I saw this film on True Movies (which automatically made me sceptical) but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue (of which there is little) but because actually despite what people say I thought the film was accurate in it's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy. It's NOT Dawson's Creek they're not graceful cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge. They're kids and they act like kids would. They're blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything. Yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but I don't think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when not trying to be cool) a very believable performance and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette IS whiny and annoying but she was pregnant and a teenagers? The combination of the two isn't exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was VERY predictable and but so what? I believed them his stress and inability to cope - her brave yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together. I think the characters acted by anyone else WOULD indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't. It reflects the surreality of the situation they're in that he's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby. I felt angry at her for that I felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her. I felt it all. In the end I loved it and would recommend it. Watch out for the scene where Dermot Mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session - career performance. ",positive
" Director Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of varied quality but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable masterworks. This is the story of alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's handsome male lover. In the meantime the writer is plagued with strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions. Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller very original and provocative. I love films that make you think they are about something but then you realize they are about something completely different. This is one of those movies; a thriller during the first half and a quasi-religious surrealist saga during the second half. Very erotic original and blasphemous not for kids or people that go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography by future director Jan de Bont. Highly Reommended! ",positive
" Some people say this is the best film that PRC ever released I'm not too sure about that since I have a fond place in my heart for some of their mysteries. I will say that this is probably one of the most unique films they or any other studio major or minor ever released. The plot is simple. The ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring. Into this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghosts victims the current ferryman. She takes over the ferry business as the ghost closes in on the man she loves. Shrouded in dense fog and set primarily on the single swamp set this is more musical poem than regular feature film.Listen to the rhythms of the dialog especially in the early scenes their is poetical cadence to them. Likewise there is a similar cadence to the camera work as it travels back and forth across the swamp as if crossing back and forth across the door way between life and death innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson more than a normal horror film. Its an amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history. This isn't to guild the Lilly. This is a low budget horror/mystery that tells you a neat little story that will keep you entertained. Its tale of love and revenge is what matters here not the poetical film making and it holds you attention first and foremost (the technical aspects just being window dressing.) If there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production. The fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land. The constant back and forth across it is okay for a while but even after 58 minutes you do wish that we could see something else. Don't get me wrong I do like the film a great deal. Its a good little film that I some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken. Its definitely worth a look if you can come across it. ",positive
" This films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy B movie. It will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy. It should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese. But the two come together in this film in ways that make you go Hmmmmm... that's so stupid! and then have you laughing. For example there is a scene back in 16th Century Japan which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. In the background of the temple there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts. Hmmmm... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the acting goes from decent to bearable to oh my Lord but that's what makes it funny. You'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. I have to digress somewhat though because I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays and she is awesome. Her air time in the film was pretty short though. I have also seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie. Anyhow it's an entertaining film if you've got nothing to do on a weekday evening. ",positive
" Life stinks is a parody of life and death happiness and depression. The black and the white always present in our lives. Mel Brooks performance is brilliant as always and the other actors work is fine too. This movie has some Capra flavor that´s why is so good. There are some unforgettable gags such as the one when Brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street and all the people passing by just ignore him or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is Paul Getty and then start arguing and slapping each other. If you haven´t seen it you don´t know what you´ve missed. This movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. The only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending and reality hasn´t. Yes indeed Life Stinks. ",positive
" I loved this exiting republic serial! The story was one of the best I have ever seen! Even tough the picture quality was not of the best but OK. The fencing in this serial is also a bit bad but not terrible. They only should have practised some more. As I said the story is GREAT! You're just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is excellent! It's the same guy who maid the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro who maid the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and so are the legioners! I highly recommend this serial. Buy it! I love that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is funny smart and brave! Mark: 6. ",positive
" One of the best (if not the best) Stephen King's screenings.

" If you a purist don't waste your time - otherwise hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the Stewart Granger/Deborah Kerr version - I've seen it dozens of times but this film is every bit as good only different. I won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film. Also it is a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a huge Indiana Jones fan) Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain and the supporting cast is superb. I find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a Hallmark Production and this film was no exception. The cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment you won't be disappointed. ",positive
" Anyone who doesn't like this film is one who is afraid to explore his or her own demons. This film does make the viewer a little uncomfortable at times but that is its intention. It asks you to look at your own life and confront the obstacles head on like Lou eventually does. It asks you to overcome the fear of perception and become who you are meant to be. Bret Carr holds up a mirror unlike any filmmaker has. The intention and the message is clear and profound. People's apprehension about this film stems only from their own insecurities. An open-minded viewer takes this inspirational message and runs with it. Sometimes a life- changing realization DOES come in a flash -- a light bulb going on. This story is real and changes the lives if its viewers in a real way. ",positive
" I've just seen The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it quite good. This was George Sanders's first appearance as the Saint where he replaces Louis Hayward. In this one the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting at a night club. With the help of his acquaintance Inspector Fernack who has come down from New York they help a daughter of a crime boss. Joining Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. Not a bad Saint movie. Worth seeing. Rating: 3 stars out of 5. ",positive
" What can be said really... The Tenant is a first-class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia. It's an intricately-plotted film--every detail seems included for a reason--even though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner. Therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski)--a meek Polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide--to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty. After an apartment-warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers Trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu*k on par with the later efforts of David Lynch. The Tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score. It's a movie that's better experienced than described so hop to it.

" Entertaining Jim Belushi vehicle a modern cockeyed version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a sort-of angel who lets Belush see what life would have been like if he had made it big . Jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast; seems like real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not an Oscar contender but good warm-hearted fun. ",positive
" Of course by any normal standard of film criticism Soldier is a very poor film indeed. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats. Abandoned on a junk planet he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening family life and um breasts. Kurt doesn't talk much. Finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet gets totalled. The end. Unless the Academy start a new category for Best Explosion Soldier is not going to win any awards. However as ludicrous as it is it remains an enjoyable experience. The military hardware is the coolest since Aliens (the APC's especially) and at 90 minutes long it doesn't outstay its welcome. Please note that the below mark is only a guide. Knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns. 7 out of 10 ",positive
" A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious phantom woman and Franchot Tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor. As well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drugged out trap drummer as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy. If you're used to seeing Raines in more wholesome parts she's allowed to go overboard here especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different and though it isn't a convincing part he acts phenomenally. While the conspiracy is too contrived the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting.

" Garam Masala is one of the funniest film I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is Amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. The director Priyadarshan has delivered great Movies in the past. Hera Pheri Hungama and Hulchul being some of the Best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has made. The three newcomer actresses are average. Rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with loads of Laughs this is one Non stop Entertainer. ",positive
" Burlinson and Thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie along with Dennehy. Although it is at first thought to be only about love it really goes down deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this movie placing among one of the best I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic!! Any horse-lovers out there will love this movie! ",positive
" I love cartoons. They can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons') good taste ('South Park') spectacle ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age' such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time it's a really fun film. Sit back enjoy the deliberate anachronisms the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs. The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth Sid an idiotic sloth and Diego a sabretooth tiger as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way naturally they have a whole lot of problems. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat history's unluckiest rodent who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers on top of dead trees in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic. It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in but some of the scenes such as the nappy-changing or the dodos are hilarious the animals are likeable and it looks good. There is one quite touching moment too when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes. Not a must-see but good for a fun hour or so. 7/10 ",positive
" The reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did!! That means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it. When I first saw this Movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion. This is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written. Of course non believers will say its only a sci-fi movie. Truth is this movie is a must have for your thriller collection even if it does have a religious view. If you are a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc) this is one of them and its a must have. I never saw the sequel (Distant Thunder) but I believe it picks up where this movie ends. ",positive
" I wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily I managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history......I was hooked. The premise was pretty simple; two hardened Nemesis agents Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling ( William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are partnered up with an expert (if not young) Doctor and Biologist (Sharron Macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china. Whilst making their escape their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the Himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come... The series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and I guess it was its relatively short lived one season run that has set it up for cult status. Monty Berman the producer was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in Episodes such as Happening ( a studio deputising for the Australian outback) and the 'snow' sets of Operation Deep Freeze and The Beginning but if you can get past this and focus on the characters and the story lines the show was really a lot of fun. It had a great mix of adventure and plenty of deadpan humour (mainly from some terrific one liners from William Gaunt). The chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about Anthony Nicholls awful wig!!). They all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. I have to say I was always a Richard Barrett fan - I loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn't cross and those eyes........the bluest eyes you would probably see on TV. I have also followed Bill Gaunts career with interest since. However Craig Stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and I am sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too. The show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with including Donald Sutherland Jeremy Brett Peter Wyngarde Burt Kwouk Anton Rodgers Kate O'Mara Jenny Linden Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. Notable episodes for me were : Auto Kill The Interrogation The Fanatics The Mission and The Gilded Cage but I am sure every one has their personal favourites. If you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time or to re watch it after many years remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and I don't think I will ever tire of it. Enjoy! ",positive
" Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie funny tender brave and lover.He gives a superior dimension to a movie which is even a masterpiece as much by the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida:miaoooou!!) as by the story or the rhythm.

" I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra as it has received a good score of 7.3 stars but only a few of the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers. This is an old movie and the animation shows but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. There are few if any references to specific Japanese culture and great for Anime novices to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra himself is witty and likable. I cannot say how much of this is due to the English dub or the intentions of the maker but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find truly funny. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note. I cannot think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly. You barely realise that it is happening but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural. You also really feel the characters went on a journey and they're lives were changed by the whole experience. Check out if you can. ",positive
" The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright (yet volatile) lights of Broadway filled with typically naïve optimism. Of course their first attempt fails and Kermit (leader of the group and author of the show) blows his top; so the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner (the old man then has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs!). We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars: Art Carney (as a producer) James Coco (as an overzealous dog owner) Dabney Coleman (as a confidence trickster) Elliott Gould (who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]) Gregory Hines Liza Minnelli (as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by Kermit's sporting fake moustache as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets' show) Brooke Shields and even director John Landis (in possibly the film's funniest scene as a Broadway producer before whom Kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig!). The other Muppets more or less go through their typical paces with (regrettably) less space given to Gonzo this time around; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit's romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny. What disappoints however is the climactic show itself (after a fairly redundant midsection wherein Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on Madison Avenue) which rather than the expected splashy routines procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy! ",positive
" This is a movie that has a lot of things that only Japanese people can understand. Even well translated there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort but that just got wasted on me. What I felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects. Some kid becomes The one and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about but between the Azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella (Rihanna eat your heart out!) I couldn't really discern the plot. Bottom line: nice visuals the kid screams a lot the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap. ",positive
" Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don't see what we expect and what surprises us. THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis) his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving! Her daughters along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living. The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story's warm ending. All is not what it seemed: it's better and well different. Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film. Well worth viewing. Grady Harp ",positive
" This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces ( The Fall of the House of Usher Dance of Death (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example The Cat and the Canary The Old Dark House Night of Terror and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. I won't go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries. Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room. Dan Basinger 8/10 ",positive
" It takes guts to make a movie on Gandhi in India in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong.This movie shows how a Mahatma failed to be a decent father(at least in the eyes of his son). The performances are terrific the cinematography fantastic the direction fabulous but the film drags.If the intention was to make this movie without any box-office expectations which i assume is the case here then its a brilliant attempt but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success then the film's fate was doomed the day they chose this subject.. 20 yrs from now this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna.He deserves an Oscar nomination for this one..And honestly his is not the only performance worth applauding Shefali Chhaya is terrific too.. Watch the scene where Harilal hears about his father's death.No dialogues No screaming but a speechless shot by Khanna.Its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of Cinema Gandhi My Father is not at all exciting cinema but yes its excellent cinema and a must watch.Brilliant Attempt..

" Though I saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me. Stephen Rea's depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving. His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable. Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x. Each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers I think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers. ",positive
" This is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living. Some of the scenes are very funny. I don't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. Some of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in color. The way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious. There is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that. Watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it. ",positive
" So Todd Sheets once stated that he considers his 1993 shot-on-video Z-epic Zombie Bloodbath to be his first feature film. Anyone who's ever seen a little beauty called Zombie Rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is. I mean what makes this one that much more superior? Well then again Zombie Rampage doesn't include that mullet guy now does it? For one to comprehend exactly why Zombie Bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn one must remember what the 90's were like for lovers of bad horror. A decade that all but said goodbye to B and Z-cinema as we knew it. Technological advances awkward trends and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms of the s.o.v.'s big-boxed golden years. And anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self-aware for it's own good basically defeating the purpose. Luckily not everyone changes with the times. Enter Zombie Bloodbath. And I guess this is the part where I explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last 40 years. Alright so Some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight turning them into flesh-eating zombies who go on a rampage inflicting some of the most gruesome yet humorous gore-scenes of the 90's. The first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkward-sounding conversations you could imagine. Conversations that let you know that this isn't just a low-budget zombie flick this is a Z-grade disasterpiece fella. plenty Hysterical non-existent acting to go around and that goes triple for Mr. Mullet. That guy is truly the highlight of the night. The fact that Todd Sheets seriously considers Zombie Bloodbath to be THAT superior to Zombie Rampage amuses me to no end. I mean really both are complete jokes on celluloid but then again so is Redneck Zombies so obviously Todd Sheets is in the company of awsomeness. By 1993 a movie this bad would no doubt be a full-blast spoof but Mr. Sheets stands his ground giving us some good old fashion schlock the way it was meant to be unaware clueless and pointless. God bless Todd Sheets. For anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90's B-Horror Leif Jonker's Darkness should be at the top of your list. As for Zombie Bloodbath if you're a gorehound who got bored sometime around 1990 then '93 would be the perfect time to pick up. 8/10 ",positive

" What a brilliant film. I will admit it is very ambitious with the subject matter. At a little over two and a half hours it is a very long film too. But neither of these pointers are flaws in any way. Cry Freedom despite the minor flaws it may have is a powerful moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist Steve Biko in his struggles to awaken South Africa to the horrors of the apartheid. It is true that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact. People have also complained that the film suffers from too much Woods not enough Biko. I may be wrong but although it is Biko's story it is told in the perspective of Woods so Woods is an important character in conveying Biko's story to the world. Cry Freedom visually looks amazing. With the show-stopping cinematography and the stunning South African scenery it was a visual feast. The opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot. George Fenton's music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes. It was subtle in scenes in the second half but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes. The script was of exceptional quality the courtroom scenes with Biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff. The first half with Biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about whether it was the police's attack of the South African citizens or Biko's death. The second half entirely about Donald Woods carries less of an emotional punch but is compensated by how it is shot performed and written. And there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well. The performances were exceptional from the entire cast from the most minor character to the two leads there wasn't a single bad performance. Regardless of the accents that is but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in. Denzel Washington in one of his more understated performances gives a truly compelling performance as Biko and Kevin Kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of Washington's. And the two men's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note. Penelope Wilton is lovely as Donald's wife Wendy and she is a great actress anyway. Out the supporting performances and there may be some bias two stood out for me. One was Timothy West who relishes his role as Captain DeWet. The other was the ever exceptional John Thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameo-role as Kruger. Lord Richard Attenborough's direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual. Overall a truly wonderful film. Ambitious and long it is but never ceases to be compelling powerful and achingly moving. A definite winner from Lord Richard Attenborough and worthy of a lot more praise. 10/10 Bethany Cox ",positive
" First of all I've got to give it to the people that got this thing together. 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts. It's a shame although not surprising that the movie was banned in the US. That being said I think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments. The movie starts up with the Iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of Majid Majidi's work (the absolutely beautiful heaven's children and the color of paradise ). Much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of Afgan refugees in Iran. Absolutely beautiful clip. Same goes for Sean Penn's clip which is superb as well. But just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal. Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut-wrenching Amores perros he does it as brutal as he can. Most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background. Those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families those who were angry....and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers. A very hard clip to watch and one that you won't forget. Some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for Americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as you're not the only ones that are suffering . In particular the Egyptian and British clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the US has caused to other people. I will also make a special mention to the clips from Bosnia-Herzegovina France India and Japan (although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn't). However not all the clips are great and I make a special mention on the clip from Israel which in my opinion is extremely weak. While the idea was good (a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in New York is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to) the realization is terrible. The clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air-time at all costs a guy saying he's a witness and hoping that he can go on TV and soldiers and paramedics shouting just because . The clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation. If you happen to have the chance to see it then you should that is unless you're a conservative in which case you'd better stay out as you might get offended. But if you're not then you might learn how many of us outside the US lived through 9/11. ",positive
" How anyone can say this is bad is beyond me. I loved this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons 1. The Story intrigued me 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please ignore the bad comments and Please watch the whole first Season before you decide that it's bad because I know that if you watch the first Season you will LOVE it and go out and Buy Season 1 as well as Season 2 on DVD and then Join the campaign to get Season 3 Made!

" ...Heads Hands and Feet - a band from the past just like Strange Fruit. A triple whammy there. Those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40 and have had no experience of the real thing. Sad for them. This is an achingly well-observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two and will probably not even fade much on the second showing. Stephen Rae Timothy Spall as the fat drummer (in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all) and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances and Juliet Aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as Karen who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self-destruct. The Syd Barrett/Brian Wilson echoes are loud and clear Mott the Hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute. Don't compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unfair on all of them. The nearest comparison is The Commitments and that's no bad thing. And any film that can conjure up memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I do not remember ever seeing but the name lives on - well it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about. A small delight and thanks for the memory. Oh... and I've got ANOTHER one - Stiff Little Fingers; a-a-and what about SteelEYE Span... Spooky TOOTH... Ten Inch NAILS anyone? (You have to see the movie or have been on the road) ",positive
" Intelligent wry and thrilling The Invisible Man stood out in 2000 among Sci-Fi's usual lineup balancing out Farscape 's fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. The show sat between Law and Order and Doctor Who on the believability meter but there was no denying the fact that I-Man 's characters went beyond caricature. Even characters that verged on predictability like the Keeper the Official and Eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. The show's low points are still entertaining and I've never seen such taut pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be commended and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. Every time I come across a marathon of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys on Sci-Fi I roll my eyes and sigh mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that Invisible Man and its ilk represented.

" Originally I rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer - and I was not disappointed that way (except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes). As a dad I suppose I was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays (as uncomfortable as I feel with the topic). In a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is introduced by a young British-born teen girl - Jasminder (Jess) - of east-Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer. The pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships. In SUMMARY the soccer scenes are GREAT (lots to learn in slowmo) and while I didn't need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going. ",positive
" In an alternate 1950s where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars a young loner Timmy finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly) his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie. Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father who tried to eat him!). Timmy runs into a spot of bother however when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. With the authorities on Fido's trail trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend? A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick Fido is a thoroughly entertaining deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that I have seen. Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame along with Day Of The Dead's Bub and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse but The Big Yin's performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances with young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentionsRay because for one so young he puts in a particularly assured turn and Moss because she is so bloody yummy! This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead) and to my surprise it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future. 8.5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for IMDb. ",positive
" Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. He may have been the most talented comedian of the silent age. This gives him a chance to display those talents in a little time travel story. He get hooked up with a guy living in modern times and it becomes obvious that we are best left in our own times Keaton is able to do his sight gags very well. I've heard his voice before. I believe he did some of those Beach Party films playing some vacuous characters just to earn a few bucks. Serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way. It's not a bad story. It shows how one reacts when we wish for something we don't have and get that wish. ",positive
" I have recently seen this production on DVD. It is the first time I have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as I remembered. At first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the BBC serials were back then. (I miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoons back then) But that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been. I am a bit of a Jane Eyre purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one. I have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on. Reading the scene near the end where Rochester questions Jane about what St John was like I noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly. All the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way some even leave out the Rivers family and their connection to Jane altogether. I also think this is the only production to include the Gypsy scene done correctly. The casting is perfect Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book small plain and dark and I disagree that she looked too old. Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as Rochester portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off! I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted his expression is fantastically frightening. But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another. A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable. Oh to be loved by a man like that! There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things (I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks). Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection! ",positive
" Intelligent stylish and compelling thriller from the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films! When troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger the victim's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer. Dressed to Kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense. The finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish'.It's a truly edge of your seat shocker. Even more impressive though is De Palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film but mainly in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film. The cast is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as an involved street-walker is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son. Many criticize De Palma's films for having Hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. But any similarities between Hitchcocks works and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality as calling this film a 'rip-off' would be degrading to a fine thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must see for all cinema fans. **** out of **** ",positive
" I was very surprised with this film. I was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his marie the little girl he was separated from. The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do. Actually i was expecting paulie wants a cracker jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference. So if you wish to see a good animal that talks film check this one out much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well.

" I just have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I cannot even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Gilley's I was in awe. Debra Winger as always delivers a perfect performance as the young naive wife of Bud but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country music person which I wasn't this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word. If you get a chance please see this movie-it won't disappoint.

" A brutally depressing script and some fine low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good location shooting in Ohio power this fine TV movie about hard times in the rustbelt. As the mills close and the union jobs disappear the blue-collar workers are threatened by everyone: management owners their wives and children. Strauss is completely believable in his role and Pamela Reed is as always wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he put on weight. The heavy metal score -- was someone making a pun? -- is at times obtrusively annoying but the cinematography by Frank Stanley is knockout particularly the mill scenes. ",positive
" As part of the celebration of the release of Casino Royale this film with the new Bond starring in it was shown from director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost turned it off for being a bit boring but I'm glad I stuck with it. Basically May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years. Her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig of course). After knowing each other only a few days May and Darren have a secret affair. And at her age with a 30-something and the new Bond?! Anyway they obviously want to keep it a secret but May has regrets and wonders if Helen will find out. When she does Darren gets less hassle than May. In fact Helen asks her permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots Danira Govich as Au Pair Harry Michell as Harry Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English's Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good! ",positive
" This movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old where actors didn't have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their film. Firstly I think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita it is definitely the making of the film. I have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy. In response to this I think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis however considering this is a Barjatya film I think that compared to MPK HAHK HSSH and MPKDH it has been toned down significantly. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places. In this film however when the sentimental moments come along you find yourself smiling wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them. Another major plus point is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both have acted very well especially Shahid who looks great in the film. Amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star. Although I really enjoyed the film as a whole I do feel that it was too long. Some of the middle could have been trimmed off and it would maybe made even more of an impact. I also think the music although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack had been available. Although the picturisation of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful. All in all I definitely recommend this film its romantic looks stunning and has a dramatic climax (I won't go into details just in case you haven't seen it. PS. If you're prone to crying-take a tissue! (I needed several) ",positive
" Well let me just say something about these actors they really were a good decision and from experience having actors really brings the dialogue to life. If you walk into this even fifteen minutes late you'll be in for a shock the movie will have already began. You don't want to miss the first few jokes assuming you came to not miss any jokes. Wow! I have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending. Not to be harsh I mean I loved it but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped! But i'm getting ahead of myself lets start with the very start of it when it began. The plot outline goes like this there is this man and not to give away any spoilers (*Spoiler Alert!!*) (he hasn't had any sex ever(!) they use this plot device to set the story moving and there are (intentionally or not it could go either way) some funny situations had by the main characters some containing irony and jokes and awkward situations you know. The director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog some music and jokes to make a funny movie designed as a comedy where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between. I went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what I already knew about it and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy. TEN STARS!!!

" Sure for it's super imagery and awesome sound it's a great home theater show off disk but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. Young old boys and girls alike will find that deep down we are all fans of the automobile especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood sweat tears ingenuity and perseverance. The Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content. I don't want to give away the ending but the final driving sequence to Quincy Jones' Days Like These just might bring a tear to your eye. Enjoy it! ",positive
" The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting. The film starts out in a flurry as Bourne is running from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. Or does it? The time is a little muddled here but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. They aren't his target. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player Noah Vosen who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past with Bourne as well. The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. All in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year if not the best action trilogy ever. ",positive
" Given the title this first follow-up to QUARTET (1948) obviously reduces the number of W. Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes but there’s no epilogue this time around; by the way while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation as well as Noel Langley (though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). As can be expected much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members namely Naunton Wayne Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled “The Colonel’s Lady?). While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time) it’s still done with the utmost care acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain. “The Verger? tells of a church sexton (James Hayter) – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (Michael Hordern) simply because he’s illiterate. Rather than rest on his laurels despite his age he not only takes a wife (his landlady played by Kathleen Harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and with business flourishing this is developed into a whole chain. The last scene then sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who not only is surprised to learn of Hayter’s lack of education but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies with some measure of irony that he had the calling to be a verger! The second episode “Mr. Know-All? is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (Nigel Patrick) British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife (Anne Crawford). During a fancy-dress party however the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate)!; still it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by Crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation Wayne challenges Patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford’s position if he were to tell so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! As can also be deduced from the title “Sanatorium? deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by Andre' Morell; the protagonist is a new intern Roland Culver who wistfully observes the various goings-on. The narrative in fact highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous (the ‘feud’ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie) one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between naïve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a ‘lifer’ while Rennie only has a few years left to him leads the couple to the altar).

" I was going to give it an 8 but since you people made 6.5 out of a lot better votes I had to up my contribution. The river Styx was pure genius. Sure Woody was his perennial stuff but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really hilarious and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialog was clever enough and Woody's card tricks at the parties along with the reaction from the upper crust were fun to watch. This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be. And a plus a little Sorcerer's Apprentice to go along with it. And of course did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit frumpy? Charles Dance is always entertaining as was Hugh Jackman. ",positive
" Care Bears Movie 2: A New Generation isn't at all a bad movie. In fact I like it very much. Yes I admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times. But Darkheart while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain and Hadley Kay did a superb job voicing him. Speaking of the voice acting it was great nothing wrong with it whatsoever. The animation is colourful and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking. The songs and score are lovely especially Growing Up and Forever Young the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two. The care bears who I do like are adorable and the human children are well done too. And the ending is a real tearjerker. All in all harmless kiddie fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox ",positive
" the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension. Ripstein's lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who like the Colonel suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose. Unlike the absurdity of WAITING FOR GODOT the Colonel's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life. Two things in the film drive the Colonel who is masterfully played by Fernando Lujan; the hope that his military pension will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son Agustin died for a noble cause a reason other than a drunken fracas at a rigged cockfight. Unable to realize the former and forced to prove to the world the latter the Colonel does the only thing he can do set about training his son's fighting cock. The cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the Colonel and his asthmatic wife but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner Agustin. In a tense scene of confrontation between the Colonel and Nogales his son's killer the Colonel is offered by Nogales a paid government agent money enough to equal the Colonel's full pension. But this is blood money; hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals and to conceal to the world that the warrior colonel's son was assassinated because he wrote for an underground paper that favored the rights of labor unions and the common man. With maximum dignity the Colonel rejects Nogales' offer picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him. Once he is at home Dona Lola his scolding wife wants to know why the Colonel refused the money when both of them are starving. In response to her continued question What are we going to eat until November (when the cockfighting season begins) the Colonel responds Shit. Excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives and excrement is a meal that the Colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him. The Colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles. ",positive
" Enchanted April is a tone poem an impressionist painting a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. I continue to wait albeit less patiently for the film to come out in DVD format. Apparently I am not alone. If parent company Amazon's listings are correct there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries. The cast is spectacular the cinematography and direction impeccable. The film is a definite keeper. Many have already asked.

" Godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one and probably the strongest kind that could be made about Ralph Bakshi's take on Tolkien's magnum opus the Lord of the Rings has actually been made by Peter Jackson. The recent trilogy to me aren't even total masterpieces but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post-modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good sweeping entertainments. But as one who has not read the books I end up now looking upon the two versions live-action (albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way) and animated (albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework) in relation to just the basic story not even complete faithfulness to the books. And with Bakshi's version it's almost not fair in a way as what we do see is really not the complete vision not what Jackson really had (probably final cut). Robbed of Return of the King's big climactic rush of the story and with the other two parts becoming rushed I ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations though as such those same limitations make it disappointing. What's interesting too after seeing the Jackson films first- which I also slightly regret being that I might've reacted to this differently when I was younger and prior to five years ago- is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with. Everything that is really needed to tell the Fellowship of the Ring story is actually pretty much intact and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in Tolkien's book is given some clarity in this section. The actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes are more or less adequate for the parts with a few parts standing out (John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squire as Gandalf). The lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face-value for those who've not even seen the other films or read the books and can't put them into context. But there is some level of interest always with the characters and here there's a more old-fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more. This is not a garden variety Disney adaptation- warts and all this is a Bakshi film with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of Middle Earth. And what Bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen in all its abbreviated form its hit or miss appeal. Along with being not totally complete as a film or as stories the form of the film is an experiment to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped. The results end up bringing what seems now to be retro but at the time of course was something that was a rough crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers. Might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation? In some parts yeah; it does become a little noticeable as was also the case in Bakshi's American Pop that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky like some kind of comic-book form done in a different way. Still there's much I admired in what was done. The orcs for example I found to be really amazing in they're surreal surroundings. They're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live-action especially during parts where there isn't battle footage (that's really the real hit-or-miss section as there isn't continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping) and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback. It's creepy in a good way. And the backgrounds while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together. It's almost something for art-film buffs as much as for the ring-nuts. So how would I recommend this animated take on the Lord of the Rings? I don't know to tell the truth. It's certainly a good notch above the other Tolkien animated film I've seen the Hobbit (and I've yet to see the animated ROTK) and there is some real artistry going on. There's also some stilted dialog an all-too-rushed Two Towers segment with the most intriguing character Gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all. And seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films. If you're a fan of the books contemplating checking this out I would say it's worth a chance even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. As for it fitting into Bakshi's other films I've seen it's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement where as with Lynch's Dune it's bound to draw a dark mordor-like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don't. I don't. ",positive
" I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. The director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty good the F/X and stunts were well done. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out OK. ",positive
" I read Holes in 5th grade so when I heard they were doing a movie I was ecstatic! Of course being my busy self I didn't get chance to see the movie in theaters. Holes was at the drive-in just out of town but alas We were just too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me! They all said it was good but I've read great books that have made crappy movies so I was definately worried. Suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came. It was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and I was left to babysit. My sister who is 9 and I watched it and absolutely loved it! I then took it to the other people I was babysitting's house and their kids 9 and 4 liked it too. Even my parents loved it and they're deffinately movie critics. Overall I recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morale and and loves a hilarious cast! This movie should be on your top 5 to See list!!!! ",positive
" Excellent documentary ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two West Coast retro rock'n'roll bands: The Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre. What it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath - Anton Newcomb - and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world. Interestingly for a music documentary there is hardly any music. What there is - snatches of songs more often than not aborted by the performers - is incidental rather than central. Although the protagonists are musicians the story is not about music but rather about a particularly American version of a British myth of a cartoon lifestyle ie one where nobody has to take responsibility for behaving like spoiled adolescents on a full-time basis. Tantrums drugs violence grossly dysfunctional attitudes egomania on a truly epic scale - all of this is excused or positively encouraged because it conforms to some collectively held idea about what rock'n'roll is about. As a film this is a first-class documentary but it raises more questions than it answers. For example why is Anton's music so conservative? For someone so wild and outrageous (and he IS wild and outrageous) his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious derivations of his 60s idols (The Stones Velvets etc.) For someone who claims to be able to play 80 instruments he has never bothered to learn to play any one of them beyond the most rudimentary level. Similarly the Dandy Warhols burning ambition is based on a vision of rock'n'roll which is astonishingly fossilised in 1969. Nothing wrong with pastiches of course but surely there's more to musical life than perpetually acting out a cartoon from the late 60s. Why don't they take some risks with their music - in the way that their role models did? Because one suspects this is not about music. Music is just an accessory a prop or an excuse to lead completely dysfunctional and irresponsible lives. But why? In the Dandy Warhols case the answer is obvious: to make lots of money and be famous. Big deal. Anton Newcomb's case is more interesting. He is obviously very talented but every time he is given an opportunity to reach a wider audience he sabotages it usually in the most dramatic way possible. He is terrified of success and at the same time deeply resents anyone else who has it - especially his former friends the Dandy Warhols. Fascinating movie. Highly recommended. ",positive
" This great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a DVD along with Prelude to War. The great American filmmaker and story teller Frank Capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused World War II and Hitler's rise. Every school child nay every American should watch these films today because they are so apropos. History has been repeating itself over and over again! The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking; the tactics used by the Nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups are still working to these evil group's advantage. By sitting back and letting Hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - France America and England caused over 50 million people's deaths. Americans French and British today would happily let Hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties. These great films may be too simplistic for World War II history buffs. They don't tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at the time America was teamed up with them fighting Hitler. This film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war. ",positive
" Hugh (Ed Harris) is a hotshot bachelor senator determined to run for president. One day however he happens upon an old high school classmate named Aggie. Aggie (Diane Keaton) is an accomplished and award-winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit. Hugh is smitten. He convinces Aggie to become his fiancé. But will Aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics where things are not always what they seem to be? And will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz? This is mostly a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection. Hugh and Aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view. However although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality it doesn't completely succeed. Nevermind. The production values are high and the script is very elegantly written. With these advantages and the handsome personages of Keaton and Harris those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment. ",positive
" HOLLOW MAN is one of the better horror films of the past decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I have ever seen in a horror film. Kevin Bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way. Claude Rains shocked the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933 well now Kevin Bacon has shocked *us* with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most thrilling horror films ever. The action is intense and the chills are true. You may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Shue Josh Brolin Kim Dickens Joey Slotnick Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. All of whom do an exceptional job. ---SPOILERS--- Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible. After animal testings they move on to human testing. But someone has to be the subject. Volenteering Caine is turned invisible. But when his team is unable to bring back into visibility Caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge...*end spoilers* The film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century. Becoming the basis for a spoof joke in SCARY MOVIE 2 this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The first 45 minutes or so are slow developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man. And then change the water into fire and explosions. A rehashing of a killer shark movie. Interesting... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5. ",positive
" I had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct Sicilian TV channel; amazingly the film emerged as a heftily-priced DVD from Criterion: not being sure what I had made of it initially (despite having attained cult status over the years the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs) I opted not to make the purchase  as I did with the similar and to me unfamiliar FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958). Recently however I managed to acquire THE BLOB via a copy of the Spanish DVD which interestingly ported over the two Audio Commentary tracks from the Criterion Special Edition but regrettably I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature! Anyway looking at the film anew I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it (despite many a narrative flaw which I will get to later)  as a pure example of 'B-movie' schlockiness (atypically shot in pleasant color) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes. The male lead was an early role for Steve(n) McQueen and though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging: not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent (and more importantly altruistic) kid. The special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period; the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster's invasion of a cinema (showing DAUGHTER OF HORROR [1953/7] as I mentioned recently in that film's review but being curiously screened 'flipped' and which sequence incidentally would be featured at the opening of a satirical Italian program actually called Blob !). As to the admittedly minor quibbles I have with the film: the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places never being seen by anyone!; there is a baffling over-emphasis (tantamount to padding) on the kids' scrapes with Police; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at The Blob  as if fluid whatever its proportion can be destroyed by bullets!; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits (especially when considering that at that stage only McQueen had actually seen the monster in action)! An inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called BEWARE THE BLOB!; the original was then remade in 1988  I watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me (though I know Micheal Elliott loves it). For the record I will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris namely 4D MAN (1959) and DINOSAURUS! (1960). ",positive
" They were always trying to get me killed Alec Guinness once wrote of The Man In the White Suit's technicians. They thought actors got in the way of things. He went on to describe how he'd been given a wire rope to climb down and assured it was safe narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent. People get in the way of things might be a maxim tailor-made for White Suit inventor Sidney Stratton (fittingly played blank slate-fashion by Alec Guinness) in Alexander Mackendrick's definitive Ealing film of 1951. Certainly he cares only about his work its realisation - and sod the consequences. And similarly with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters there's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour. Told in flashback the film concerns Stratton's invention of a dirt-resistant everlasting fibre (fashioned into the white suit of the title) and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it. While the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job. Abduction and bribery attempts follow with both money and an industry chief's daughter on offer (Daphne the delectable 4-packs-a-day-voiced Joan Greenwood) to the tragi-comic end. What's to become of my bit of washing when there's no washing to do? bemoans Stratton's landlady near the close. A notion Stratton hadn't even considered - and has disregarded again by the movie's ambiguous coda. A superior if decidedly downbeat comedy expertly performed - and pretty much answering the oft-raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water...

" This is the Neil Simon piece of work that got a lot of praises! The Odd Couple is a one of a kind gem that lingers within. You got Felix Ungar(Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac fussy neat-freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate Oscar Madison(Walter Matthau); a total slob. These men have great jobs though. Felix is a news writer and Oscar is a sports writer. Both of these men are divorced Felix's wife is nearby while Oscar's is on the other side of the U.S. (The West Coast). Well what can you say? Two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy is impossible as well as improbable. It's a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun. I liked the part where when those two British neighbors that speak to both gentlemen and after Oscar kicked out Felix he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier. It's about time that Felix needed to lighten up. I guess all neat-freaks neat to lighten up. They can be fussy yet they should be patient as well. A very fun movie and a nuevo classic. Neil Simon's The Odd Couple is a must see classic movie. 5 STARS! ",positive
" Although Cameron Grant was clearly hired to replace Andrew Blake over at Ultimate Pictures when the latter started his own company (Studio A) he practically outdid the Master right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes. So while all the window dressing Blake had pioneered (starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses coiffed and made up as if they're about to hit the catwalk) remained very much present and accounted for Grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content. In doing so he raised the heat to a level that had eluded Big A ever since his first  and IMHO best  film NIGHT TRIPS. Cam's maiden effort ELEMENTS OF DESIRE might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the Blake aesthetic (with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes) but his subsequent DINNER PARTY already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece. The title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories with an extended orgy at the conclusion. Scrumptious Juli Ashton and Tammy Parks smear food stuff all over each other's flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh. Busty Crystal Gold (here : Catalina ) was rarely more than a reliable second-stringer adding spice to several Ona Zee bargain basement noirs yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with Fabio lookalike Vince Voyeur. Beautiful blondes Kylie Ireland and Yvonne making out with Marc Davis (for the record the latter two were an item at the time) under a waterfall complete the eye candy section of the movie. Time to get cooking ! Early Jenna Jameson ( Daisy back then) foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains Frank Towers ( Mark Slade on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry) of all vital juices albeit with a little help from brunette Diva for effective contrast the scene's stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place. Impossibly hunky construction worker Gerry Pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down a prospect too tantalizing for prim 'n' proper business woman Asia Carrera (at her all time most achingly pretty) to pass up. Best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty Norma Jeane and handsome Sean Michaels teasing the pants off each other  for starters !  while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion. With sex that proves either artsy or hot and more often than not both Grant has concocted a veritable smörgåsbord of fleshy wares to continue the film's gastronomic analogy the title implies. Couples may be the prime intended audience but an alternation between naughty 'n' nice should rightfully include that something for everything recipe so many adult features are aiming for. Acting as his own DoP the director shows great eye for detail like the shot of Asia Carrera's pristine white shoes being spattered with mud enriching his vision. This marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one as was the case with Nick Steele who stepped up to take his place at Ultimate  effectively making him a replacement's replacement ?  when he packed up for greener pastures.

" This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm but in terms of a story.. well it's not really there. Or at least not very well worked out. The acting is also not so smooth by Caron. But I liked some of the dialogues I liked the scene at the Seine I liked the character played by Levant the colors; and the dancing of course which is quite magnificent. A 7.5 - 8 seems on the dot to me. ",positive
" There have been several films about Zorro some even made in Europe e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by outstanding actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins but to me the best of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western where you will only discover the real villain Don del Oro at its end. The serial also has good performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce C. Montague Shaw eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King and a very good performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was quick smart used well his whip and sword and his voice was the best for any Zorro. ",positive
" Presenting Lily Mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok now that you know my bias here are some reasons I think this movie does stand out. 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York becomes a star and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a pretty stock Hollywood story of the period the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual. Although Lily gets her big break when the star quits she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show. 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) 3. The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is truely wonderful as is Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The standout supporting performance though goes to character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie a one time actress turned theater custodian. Worth a watch for sure. One of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams. ",positive
" I loved this film seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen! The audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things and the fast pace was most enjoyable. I do as a singer and musical director question one section of Roby Keeler's vocal in By a Waterfall. The key modulated and she was suddenly singing much lower in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin-like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals. Does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer? It sounds it to me. I would love to know. Thanks so much. ",positive
" This movie is one of the most Underrated movie of its time. When watching this movie your filled with action and when somethings not really happing the humour is un matched. Brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix of a game show where criminals are the contestants and a near future where the general public all have a thirst for blood.Also Arnold Doesn't let us down with some of his best one liners.I don't want to spoil anything for you but i will tell you when Arnold gives his I'll be back line He gets the best response of them all in this movie. Hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did. ",positive
" Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo The Ripper of Rostov who killed 52 people in 8 years time mainly women and children. It shows how the investigation was obstructed by Soviet bureaucracy how hard it was to investigate the crimes. It does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no-one untouched. In the beginning it's perhaps a little bit slow of pace but it really grabs you as the story unfolds. I can only say that next to The Silence of the Lambs this is by far the best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. It is very hard to say which actor's performance stands out above the rest in this movie. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation. Donald Sutherland's performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him is as outstanding as Rea's. And what to say about Jeffrey DuMann playing the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred. Yes he is a monster but he is also a sad figure oppressed and ridiculed by his wife his boss his co-workers... He is tortured ashamed as well as extremely vicious. I can only recommend this movie to everybody who's interested in a well-made docu-drama where the actors are still more important than the special effects. It deserves at least a 9/10 perhaps even more if you ask me. ",positive
" huge Ramones fan. i do like the ramones and i suppose if you hate them then besides being a avid Bush supporter you might not like this classic. it's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80's. infinitely better than the American Pie's that plague us now. There are some other great high school films: Switchblade Sisters Fast Times... Class of '84 Three O'Clock High and the cheesy yet gripping(doesn't seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun plus you can get up and dance with it. I love you Riff Randell. 10/10 ",positive
" 'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is not one romance there are at least three but they all have to do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She doesn't love him but he is sweet and good man. When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course they fall instantly for each other. How this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself. Every seen is a delight to watch with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserved the Oscar that year. Cage is pretty good and goofy as well and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are terrific. This movie is funny charming and therefore highly enjoyable. ",positive
" Some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either. You'll look a long time to find a greater Rodgers and Hart fan than me but Burke and Van Heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew Der Bingle inside out and tailored some great songs - But Beautiful Moonlight Becomes You It's Always You The Day After Forever etc - to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad Once And For Always plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entries in If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon and Busy Doing Nothing. The flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously - why else make Merlin a heavy when in most if not all of the other versions he is more a friend/mentor to Arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why Sir Lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie. On balance it does what it sets out to do entertain so good luck to it. ",positive

" One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories. Farewell my Concubine The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. The film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience -- the hallmark of much Hollywood and especially Disney films. In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. Along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art. But the son eventually is found out to be a girl. From there the story get very interesting with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera -- a regional operatic style related to Peking Opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liang's portrayal of a male playing the female role in Chinese Opera. It may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality.

" This has to be hands down hats off one of the most uproarious comedies ever made. Starting with the animated blowing popping bubbles the entrance to the Daytime Awards the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co-stars and producer under phony smiles. Now THAT is only in the first few minutes. Then all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous. Ridiculous in a good way no make that a great way. This was the first time I'd seen the always charming Teri Hatcher. While I may not be a follower of Desperate Housewives she herself is always watchable - same goes for Lois & Clark. Not a huge follower but if I run across an episode I'd watch it. Robert Downey jr. does a great turn as slimy smarmy snaky sycophantic David Seaton Barnes the producer who'd give his right eye to see Sally Field's Celeste Talbert leave the show if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriarty's Montana Moorehead. Moriarty absolutely shines in this movie just as she had everywhere else she's appeared. Here all she has to do is scream I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU CREEP! or give one of her anti-Celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin and she has me rolling in the aisles. Yes Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress and one hell of a comedienne. Sally Field gratefully departs from the usual 70-MM-sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies and we're all reminded why she is who she is today having started off in comedy afraid of nothing. Her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor but like a caterpillar in a cocoon the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was. The thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy serious roles that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen. How lucky were the producers to land Carrie Fisher if only for a glorified cameo. She doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen. She takes a role which in the hands of a lesser actress could easily have been forgotten but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself. How lucky was Elisabeth Shue to get thrown in the middle of all this! At the time she wasn't really known for much. Adventures in Babysitting was kind of cute (yes I was dragged to an evening show for which I had to pay full price) but she didn't hold my attention - - much. But here she makes the most of her character - star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex-co-star-and-lover who of course turns out to be the niece's father and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother. I'll stop there - I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy or at least a novela. If you've seen it then reminisce. If you haven't you've missed a real classic but not really. The DVD's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years and this movie is timeless so what the hell. ",positive
" Watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in one's mind. movie starts with Abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage. Soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn't leaving Soha alone on to the street she cant go back home and she don't have any thing to live on here in this situation Abahy turns out to be a helper for her this is the base of story. The rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that Abhay has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat. Dialogues and music are good songs are OK direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all right. A truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10 ",positive
" This isn't the best Bigfoot ever made but by the recent standards of Nature gone awry movies mostly showing on the Sci-Fi channel this is quality stuff. It has some action some humor decent F/X and Bigfoot. CG is used but so are some practical F/X which I like. Overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of B horror/sci-fi and need a fix. It's better than the movie Sasquatch and not a sequel to it so don't be fooled. The acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate. Expect a bit of a lul as the characters are developed but know that things will pick up. If you are watching a DVD you may want to skip a chapter or two. ",positive

This movie was so realistic that if I didn't know it was fake I would have thought it was a snuff-movie. Although I was disgusted by this movie i really liked it. It scared me.

Husbands Beware is a remake of 1947's Brideless Groom widely considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the footage from that film. The new scenes shot May 17 1955 include the storyline of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sisters along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine! A few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well(a double for Dee Green was used; if you blink you will miss the double's appearance.) Husbands Beware would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters. Budget considerations coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies influenced the decision to use older footage. Although completely new films were still being made by the Stooges most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in. Husbands Beware while one of these hybrids is watchable and entertaining; we get to see most of Brideless Groom again and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film. This film is one of the last Stooge comedies to feature new footage of Shemp and it was released six weeks after his death. 7 out of 10. ",positive
" Although the plot was a bit sappy at times and VERY rushed at the end as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story overall it was pretty good for the Made-For-Backwoods-Cable-TV genre. However the actress who played the babysitter Mariana Klaveno was very good! I hope to see more of her around in movie-land. The music was also well done getting every possible chill out of the dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think JAWS ) type music-based tension build-ups. I don't think I'd want to watch While the Children Sleep again but if I did it would be to focus on the performance of the talented Klaveno. ",positive
" Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 drawing an X rating. By today's standards it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating. Jon Voight who has been better is competent in his role as Joe Buck an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in New York City. He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant but never more so than in this portrayal. He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison. Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a deft hand with his production but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. Worth seeing for Hoffman's performance alone.

" In the movie several references are made in subtly to Blade runner but one of the most obvious is the fact the Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs breed to be expendable warriors. But as favorite quote of mine from the movie is you should have made them smart as well as fast . Kurt Russell did a incredible job his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined. Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions and his tears after being expelled from the group or his shuddering when he is given a hug and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded Todd of himself and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier.

" Okay - I'll confess. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of James Cagney with charm to spare. The supporting cast are solid workers all and will step right up and do a fine job in this '80s comedy. A spoof of the '30s-'40s gangster movies it breaks new ground constantly with remarkably original material. (Well yeah - some of it has been copied since - but when this movie was made it was original and much of it has _not_ been copied elsewhere.) Watch Joe Piscopo warn people to not do ______ with one of the great taglines of spoofs. Watch Roman Moronie do things with English profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh. Watch amazing sight gags such as pet-store owner Johnny Kelly using the price-tag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens. Watch the greatest warning against sex educational film ever made. Watch the most amazing misrepresentation of church Latin done while a guy who never took shop class assembles a Thompson machine gun from parts. Watch lines you'll be using in casual conversation for the next decade. Watch Maureen Stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hard-working mom with surprise gags that you'll never see coming. If you see a gag that doesn't hit your funny bone be patient - another will come along in 30 seconds or less and the odds are you'll need to pause until you're done rolling on the floor several times. Duckies and Bunnies? Them too. Watch for the subtle stuff - some of the sight gags can go by unnoticed the first few viewings. There are a few minor flaws - but it's probably the best of the spoofs. Some come close but none of them are quite this good. ",positive
" It has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately I don't seem to be able to rent it in the video store only the other version but I fell in love with it. I was always borderline with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette as they are not British naturally have to put on the accent and well to me it doesn't seem natural. It seems put on. Sorry but don't think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there. I could not warm to any of the characters but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person I imagined Emma to be. It is definitely the version I will come back to from now on. I was disappointed that Mr Knightley was not better looking but he is convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed to her in the movie version but she is better portrayed in this version. Come to think of it (besides Mr Knightley) all characters are better played and a lot less over the top. Unfortunately both came out around same time and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Pity...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! Therefore if you are a Jane Austen fan don't forget to watch this one. ",positive
" Halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep! It is in my opinion the scariest movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was just so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is this was on a low budget and had a one note score yet managed to scare the Hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78. It's about a boy Michael Myers he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back since he describes Michael as ...pure evil. The blackest eyes the Devil's eyes . Michael is on a mission though to kill his other sister Laurie played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to babysit on Halloween while her friends are out partying and of course we know the rules they get it! But Laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin. ;D Halloween pays many homages to Psycho we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis the daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors bolt your windows and turn off the lights! They're gonna get you! They're gonna get you! . Halloween the ultimate horror film! 10/10 ",positive
" Parsifal (1982) Starring Michael Kutter Armin Jordan Robert Lloyd Martin Sperr Edith Clever Aage Haugland and the voices of Reiner Goldberg Yvonne Minton Wolfgang Schone Director Hans-Jurgen Syberberg. Straight out of the German school of film the kind that favored tons of symbolism and Ingmar Bergmanesque surrealism came this 1982 film of Wagner's final masterpiece- Parsifal written to correspond with Good Friday/Easter and the consecration of the Bayreuth Opera House. This film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avant-garde and no other Parsifal takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography. Syberberg is known for controversial films. Prior to this film he had released films about Hitler and Nazism Richard Wagner and his personal Anti-Semitism and a documentary about Winifred Wagner one of his grand-daughters. This film is possibly disturbing in many aspects. Parsifal (sung by Reiner Goldberg but acted by Michael Kutter) is a male throughout the first part of the film and then after the enchantment of Kundry's kiss is transformed into a female. This gender-bending element displays the feminine/masculine/ying-yang nature of the quest for the Holy Grail which serves all mankind and redeems it through Christ's blood. In the pagan sorcerer Klingsor's fortress there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as Hitler Nietzche Cosima Wagner and Wagner's mistress Matilde Wesendock. The Swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress. Parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film. The tempting Flower Maidens are in the nude. Kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt Mary Magdalene or Eve from Genesis (played by Edith Clever but beautifully sung by mezzo-soprano Yvonne Minton). Ultimately this film is for fans of this type of bizarre Germanic/European symbolic metafiction and for intellectuals who appreciate the symbolism the history and lovers of Wagner opera. Indeed the singing is grand and compelling. Reiner Goldberg's Parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater Parsifals of the stage - James King Wolfgang Windgassen Rene Kollo and today's own Placido Domingo. Yvone Minton is a sensual-voiced dramatic and exciting Kundry delving into her tormented state perfectly. While the production is certainly unorthodox and as un-Wagnerian as it can possibly get (Wagner's concept was Christian ceremonial pomp with Grails spears castles Knights and wounded kings a dark sorcerer darkness turning into light etc typical Wagnerian themes)..it is still an enjoyable art-house film.

" My personal feeling is that you cannot divorce this movie from its political/historical underpinnings like so many (American) reviewers tend to do. This is not about growing up on Main Street USA. It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the East and the West. Just like the guys are torn between Esther and everybody else and Esther is torn between the Tovarish Joe and the guys. There is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under Tito. I feel the movie is under-rated and it is too bad we have lost the director. Movies like this make freedom feel more important. It is not just another Eastern European coming of age film ...it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom. ",positive
" This 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Sadly Gordon only in his early forties died soon after completing this his only feature film. It's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character-driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. It plays almost like a 1930's-style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. The plot centers on Arthur Bach a drunken diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring Susan Johnson an heiress handpicked by his old-money father and dotty grandmother. Of course he doesn't love her and by chance runs into Linda Marolla a working-class waitress (and of course aspiring actress) after she pilfers a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father. The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by Moore. That he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to Gielgud's feisty acidic turn as Hobson Arthur's devoted but reality-grounded valet. It's the type of role he could play in his sleep but Gielgud makes Hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. In probably her most likable film role Liza Minnelli hands the picture to her male co-stars by toning down her usual razzle-dazzle personality and making Linda quite genuine in motivation. A pre- LA Law Jill Eikenberry plays Susan just at the right passive-aggressive note while Barney Martin (Jerry's dad on Seinfeld ) steals all his scenes as Linda's slovenly father Ralph. The one fly in the ointment is veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. And I have to admit that I still can't stand the very dated overplayed Christopher Cross song that inevitably won the Oscar for that year's best song. Unfortunately the 1997 DVD certainly in need of remastering has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes. ",positive
" This episode is certainly different than all the other Columbos though some of the details are still there the setup is completely different.

" I saw Jack Frost for £4:00 at my local store and I thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was right it was good. For starters this film is about a killer snowman so that's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the Snowman on the cover. The acting was okay and the lines Jack Frost said had me laughing I only axed you for a smoke and Worlds most pi**ed off snow cone how funny and camp is that? The tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack gouged eyes with candle sticks . If you're looking for a for a B-Movie Comedy horror that's full of puns then check Jack Frost out. 10/10 ",positive
" After reading several comments I felt I had to add in my two cents as well. Sorrow Lost is one of the most memorable shorts I think I have ever seen. I had gotten the chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short amount of time. The story is focused on a young girl who is victimized by her abusive father. She is soon given the choice to stop him by a demon played by Witchblade's Eric Etebari. Having watched the show I was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. The acting was absolutely superb by him. The girl's was okay and the father's was decent. There is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future. The effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. It is rare you get to see such a high quality short. The opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film. This isn't to say that it's not without its flaws - I thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long. But this stuck in my head days after watching it. There are very few shorts with this level of quality. ",positive
" Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders' The American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage gets recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The Hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself. And small town America does not seem all that safer than the Big City. Like it's predecessor mentioned above this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable but all lead to the cathartic self discovery. ",positive
" That was the first thing that sprang to mind as I watched the closing credits to Europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have I seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of Europa are so impressive that any film I watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison forget your Michael Bay Ridley Scott slick Hollywood cinematography Europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years. Now I'd be the first to hail Lars von Trier a genius just off the back of his films Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark but this is stupid the fact that Europa has gone un-noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Life is Beautiful clean up at the academy awards (but what do the know) Europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and (until recently) any British TV channels. The visuals in Europa are not MTV gloss; it's not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style. Much like his first film The Element of Crime von Trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like Element the film begins with the main character (or in the case of Europa we the audience) being hypnotized. As we move down the tracks the voice of the Narrator (Max von Sydow) counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in Europa. This allows von Trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in Europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von Trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it's no surprise that the first shot of Leopold Kessler (Jean-marc Barr) is in colour since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film. The performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von Trier films but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round. But I would like to point out the fantastic performance of Jean-Marc Barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act. Again muck like The Element of Crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von Sydow to seal his fate. Europa is a tremendous film and I cant help thinking what a shame that von Trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time Europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes. His dedication to composition and mise-en-scene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design. But since his no-frills melodramas turned out to be Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent. 10/10 ",positive
" I'm 14 so you probably would think I have never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone like that. Boy are you wrong. I had heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won an Academy Award for it. I have been a fan of George Burns since I was ten. I saw the movie Oh God recently and loved it. This one was also very awesome. George Burns did a great job. So did Walter Matthau(this is the first time I've ever seen him perform). And even though they had really small roles Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. That special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done. Let me say this if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau you should see this movie right away! ",positive
" a movie about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating as only truth can be. It also contains some quite funny bits. Some of the acting is extraordinary see Maria Hofstätter for instance. The director has tried to depict life as realistically as possible succeeding. Coherently the sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than those of a hard-core movie. Although I hardly understood a sentence I found the vision of the movie in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding because with the dubbing half the great work of the actors gets lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly hard to duplicate by a dubber. My favorite movie ",positive
" Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a male I'm probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has their own thing that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didn't try to pound a lesson into us. The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen. Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people. ",positive
" This is an excellent show! I had a US history teacher in high school that was much like this. There are many facts in history that are not quite true and Mr Wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable. Mr Wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students. Use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining. I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down. ",positive
" THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve that works best as a thriller. That's quite surprising considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work. The Fourth Man is top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and I'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In The Fourth Man he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but as in most of his films he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face it undermines an otherwise good story. Nevertheless when you can cope with Verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé in particular. Camera Obscura --- 7/10 ",positive
" Okay first of I hate commenting on this thing but I felt like I had to stand up for this movie. So many people were bashing on it and I felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion. First off Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century. If that's what you're looking for go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy. It's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished. Secondly the acting though not Halle Berry in Monster's Ball is still good. The movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it. It's a family movie. If that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly. Lastly It has a really cute story. I think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch. It's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished. If you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you. -Lyndsay ",positive
" A case of being in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating film. It is easy to see why Chavez is so popular with his people. He gets things done. He is accessible. And it is also easy to see why the west hates him so much. He has control of the resources of his country and gives the profits back to the people. Mostly the poor. And it easy to see how the TV stations can portray misleading images to put there case. Just like the Iraq war or the war on Terror. Or those missing WMD's. Or how about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different points of view. Stop the neo cons ruling the world. Go watch this movie with an open mind. And make your own mind up. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo's: America: Freedom to Fascism. It is not the people of America that are the problem. It is the government. ",positive
" Here's the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching. And mostly it's for two reasons. One it concentrates of young people VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and The Man in the Moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that is a love triangle. And I do believe that as teens it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs will believe it for the rest of their lives. The cast of The Man in the Moon is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston who is truly a versatile actor well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. Also there is Tess Harper Jason London and a young young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road she's going to win the Academy Award. All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often. Love story or not. I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way. ",positive
" Rather nasty piece of business featuring Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (with yes a Renfield-like assistant and his mother a dwarf and yes the scientist's wife (sounds like a Greenaway movie actually lol). Lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides (why them? Who knows?) so that his wife can keep looking beautiful. He gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar. After another bride bites the dust a newspaper reporter just HAPPENS to be around for the scoop and decides to snoop around for a story. She gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and Lugosi. Heaven knows where the police were. Soon she's off to Bela's lair when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil. It all cumulates in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision as he foils her plans Oh no! What will happen? I actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is great here his hangers-on are all very very strange the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable. A fun little view. ",positive
" The quote I used for my summary occurs about halfway through THE GOOD EARTH as a captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot MORE of the looters among them as his unit has just been called back to the front lines. Of course the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film the former kitchen slave girl O-Lan (for whose portrayal Luise Rainer now 99-years-old won her second consecutive best actress Oscar). The next scene finds O-Lan dutifully delivering her bag of looted jewels to her under-appreciative husband farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni) setting in motion that classic dichotomy of a man's upward financial mobility being the direct inverse of his moral decline. For a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery false accusations misogyny starvation home invasion eating family pets mental retardation infanticide exploited refugees riots civil war summary mass street executions bigamy child-beating adultery incest and insect plagues of biblical proportions THE GOOD EARTH is a surprisingly heart-warming movie. My parting thought is in the form of another classic quote from O-Lan herself (while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband Wang Lung had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut): Meat is meat.

" The Danes character finally let's Buddy have the awful truth. Leave me alone kiss men if you want to she screams self-righteously in front of everyone thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long. Nice girl. This might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that Danes pours into this character. Great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying but hey remember there are no mistakes except maybe seeing this film. Wait a minute. This irony is intended! This is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit yes! But somehow I doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind sadly. Maybe there are a few mistakes after all. ",positive

" OK I overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews. But I did enjoy it. I didn't laugh out loud but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point. The story built. Yeah you knew it would have an happy ending--this genre always does. Meantime it was quirky with sight gags you could miss so pay attention when you watch. Stiller and Black delivered expertly yet again. Good team. They should work together more. Don't know that it will be a cult classic but it was certainly a fun ride. Not as good as WHAT ABOUT BOB or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what is? It is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie. ",positive
" A Murder investigation goes on back stage while The Vanities on its opening night plays on to an unknowing audience. Odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast its production numbers and the sheer novelty of the film. Gertrude Michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson as well as starring in the infamous Sweet Marijuana number (which was also on a 70s Bette Midler album). So while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman. We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) butts into everything. Lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. The show's best-known song is Cocktails for Two. Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting Where Do They Come From? And there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a Harlem specialty number featuring Duke Ellington! Quite the cast. Some terrific acting here especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is quite good as well. Brisson is a total zero though. Charles Middleton plays Homer Toby Wing plays Nancy Donald Meek plays the doctor and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls. ",positive
" This game show lasted just one season but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand. One false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer. It was always exciting as the contestant began drawing wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out; allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest. It was a light-hearted show but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally. Rarely seen the game show did not survive past one single season. Only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it proved to be quite unpopular even though game shows were making a big return to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950's game shows. But it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has as yet never been seen again. ",positive
" It is not every film's job to stimulate you superficially. I will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day. While this really can't be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. That indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again. This is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly. The problem with the movie is in its structure. Its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on. Though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit. The long-delayed climax of Leo's awakening comes about 20 minutes late. Great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. The compositing artifice is provocative and engaging; A character is rear-projected but his own hand in the foreground isn't. The world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop. The compositions are stunning. Whomever chose to release the (out of print) videotape in the pan & scan format must have never seen it. Where is the DVD? It is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review. You should see it at least once. You get the sense that von Trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it. I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent in which devious Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several Welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does. All von Trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies. After Zentropa von Trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary over-rated un-nuanced sap like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark. ",positive
" Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one very fortunate lady many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds. Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. Knowing nothing about the large apes she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla also as one of her children. This works well for years and Buddy the gorilla is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home. But Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore. Of course Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one in the film but he is very close to seeming totally real. Russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice. The costumes are exemplary as befitting the earlier era of the story and the settings and production values outstanding. But most importantly animals are here in abundance not only Buddy but the adorable chimps the ducks the rabbits and so forth. For those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven here on earth this is a great movie choice. All animal lovers and even those who just want to watch a great family film will go ape over Buddy. ",positive
" Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the little family moves in as the father have got a new job in a computer company there. But no paradise would be complete without its snake. Strange things happens as the family joins the local country club without the husband as it certainly holds secrets. The father is not a joiner but pressure is on him to join as everyone who is anything in the neighborhood and at work are members. Robert Urich's good guy part is a bit tepid but Joanna Cassidy as good natured housewife turning nasty sizzles. Suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci as club chairperson. Look out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a bit part as a valet. The movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for. I have seen this movie quite a few times. ",positive
" Unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for IMDb equate low budget with not good. Whatever else this movie might need more budget really isn't part of it. Big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. The nearly unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as the enigmatic Modesty and this is crucial for this movie to work. Her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable and you find yourself wishing that the camera won't leaver her face. It makes it workable that the bad guy Nikolai played by also little known (in the U.S. at least) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her something Modesty can exploit. She is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out stop wasting my time! then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen. Making a scene like that plausible doesn't happen by accident. Probably the biggest problem I have with the rail-thin Staden playing Modesty is it just isn't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. She just ain't a Peta Wilson or a pumped-up Hilary Swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch. Coaster-Waldau letting himself be overpowered by Staden looks like he's just roughhousing with his little sister. Since this is not really an action film this isn't a big flaw. I just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels. ",positive
" Actor Herman José plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the Benfica (club of its heart) FC Porto therefore these players did not play well and it wanted that the FC Port was wronged with this. But what happens is that these two players after all are good and FC Porto sell them for much money to a foreign club making a good business. The film for a small country as Portugal without great antecedents in great films is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalry that exists between North/South of Portugal (FC Porto/Benfica). Highly recommended ",positive

The thesis that Peruvians migrated to Polynesia is alive and well.

" First off this really is my favorite film ever. I don't need to give anyone a description because every a**hole does that. I am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless cheesy lame effects having' boom-stick showing' badly edited 80's metal horror masterpiece. The director (I heard) had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a FREDDY/JASON type of deal for himself. Damn I wish that could've went down like that! The soundtrack's banging'. The acting's good....CHECK THIS MOFO OUT. and any die-hard fans out there feel free to email and chat sometime. Midgetorgy....I can be found at YAHOO. ",positive
" Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To. To marvellously casted Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for Ho Sing society a 100 year old trial society. While Lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times Big D is not only impatient but also thinks that he is on top of everything. Lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. To have the total control of the gang the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a Dragon Baton which represents power and authority. Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members. He ordered his man to get the Baton before it falls onto the hands of Lok. While Big D is getting the Baton Lok has other plans for him. This is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. Johnnie To puts the greed of the human beings in the movie where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one. However no single bullet is used hardly any gangfights are involved in Election. It's the battle of the wits that makes Election stands out of the rest. Apart from Maggie Shiu the only actress in Election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie masculinity rules the whole movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung who was seen in To's previous film are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively. Together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script it makes the only HK movie to represent Cannes Fil Festival 2005. Election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie. ",positive
" I can't understand what it is that fans of the genre didn't like about this film. It was truly a lot of fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters but not this time. I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldn't enjoy the film. I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case. To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. The Mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck. People liked it for it's special effects. Films like the Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development they are more like funhouse rides. Well with that analogy the Mummy was a B ticket to the Haunting's E-ticket. ",positive
" After a chance encounter on the train a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna discussing life and love. The primary reason to see Before Sunrise is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As Celine this sexy brainy soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. Risking overstatement Celine is practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural unpretentious introspective and selflessly loving. We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. Further her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing. If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. Ethan Hawke as Jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant he sort of drags himself through certain shots. His pants fit poorly his tee shirt is coming untucked his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. Nevertheless he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence we know he is getting somewhere. After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes bars and silly diversions they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. Given his boundless luck in the romance department it is especially irksome when Jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. He contents himself with a half-baked plan quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu to reunite at the same spot in half a year. When the appointed time comes you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another perhaps even married and pregnant. For whatever reason she probably won't show while Jesse who ends up working at Target or (if he's lucky) the local library will go back to Vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alone. Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion Before Sunrise is a beautiful movie. I highly recommend both it and the sequel Before Sunset.  ",positive
" Samuel Fuller is hardly one of America's great directors. I'm not sure he qualifies as one of Hollywood's great craftsmen. But he certainly ranks up there with the best of Hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music. During the time he worked for Hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts...on time and on budget. Pickup on South Street is a case in point. On the surface it's one more of Hollywood's early Fifties' anti-Commie movies complete with appeals to patriotism a hard-boiled hero and a slimy (and copiously perspiring) bad guy. Fuller turns this bag of Hollywood clichés into a taut exciting drama with any number of off-kilter twists. The hero Skip McCoy is a three-time loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his stripes until the very end. The girl in the caper Candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined. One of the most appealing characters Moe Williams is a stoolie. And in an unusual approach to Hollywood's battle against Commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears; the hero isn't motivated by anything so ennobling. He just wants payback for a personal reason and winds up becoming...at least for now...a good guy. Plus all the actors were mostly assigned to Fuller by the studio. He had to make do. Richard Widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but Jean Peters is a surprise. She gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friends...or her clients...want her to be. And Richard Kiley who later would become a two- time Tony award winning star on Broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly. It's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us I mean introduced to us The Impossible Dream from Man of La Mancha More than anything else this tale of a pickpocket who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the Feds and the Commies moves straight ahead with great economy. The whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell. The dialogue with Fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hard-boiled pulp fiction style. That muffin you grifted...she's okay one character says to Skip about Candy. Fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next. Then Fuller throws in the character of Moe Williams. All of a sudden the story ratchets up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability. The thing I like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies Fuller's talents and strengths. In 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits Fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters -- Skip and Candy -- we're going to be involved with. And he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel Fuller setting the hook to catch us. Says Glenn Erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics In what should be an inconsequential story Sam Fuller defines his peculiar view of Americanism from the bottom up: stiff-necked aggressive self-interest that when fully expressed recognizes what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it. As always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort. He's right and it makes for a movie still vivid after 55 years.

" I do miss the company Vestron they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s. This is very apparent with the astonishing Paperhouse a film that touches me deeply each and every time I watch it. The idea of a girl manipulating a dream world with her drawings (thusly the dream world manipulating reality) and also connecting with and affecting the life of a boy she's never actually met is fascinating and never disappoints. Charlotte Burke at first seems quite precocious and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing. She becomes very self aware and strong towards the end even finding she doesn't hate boys as she so defiantly claimed at first. Through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones all visually stunning with a grand score from Hans Zimmer. I'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on CD when it was released in the United States on RCA Victor. At the time of this writing there is no DVD of Paperhouse yet available in the U.S. (only in Europe) here's hoping one of my wishes will come true as I truly cherish this beautiful film and a DVD of it would be very welcome! It's satisfying watching the girl work out her thoughts like a puzzle game trying to make the dream world work for her and her newfound friend Marc (Elliot Spiers). Both Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers do a magnificent job throughout I find the editorial comment on Amazon.com about it being hammy acting quite perplexing -- I found every aspect of Paperhouse to be exhilarating. Even in minor scenes of brilliance like when Charlotte and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door it's quite powerful. You don't have to be an arthouse type to enjoy Paperhouse just be a person that enjoys a film that stimulates and has you wanting more. There is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and I'm still in awe of the cinematography and sets. For me it's never like watching the same film twice as there are so many details to absorb and savor. A very emotional experience indeed. While there are many films I adore there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me: films like Paperhouse Static Resurrection and Donnie Darko. When I see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins all I have to do is watch Paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed. ",positive

If You Knew Susie (Like I Know Susie) is quite funny.It's a nice moment when Frank sings Brahms' Lullaby to little Dean Stockwell.It's lovely to listen to Grayson singing the tango Jealousy .The most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world and there Gene sings and dances with Jerry Mouse.Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler.They originally asked Mickey Mouse but he refused.The movie was nominated for five Oscars but Georgie Stoll got one for Original Music Score.Anchors Aweigh is some high class entertainment.

" Being half-portuguese doesn't render me half-blind (nor half-prejudiced) when discussing portuguese films. Not that I get to do that very often anyway. But this film was such a rush of adrenaline! Yes that's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history went/goes - but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese-film territory: things like using real locations in the middle of traffic-congested Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. And by God did they get it right! OK to sum it up: very emotional if you've lived through it but you'll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were. If you're just watching it randomly you're in for a good historical romp only of the very recent History kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual. Even by European standards yes. ",positive
" Forget Neo and Bourne and all those half-baked made up modern heroes. They only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes. Since they cannot be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones Hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick. However their action set-pieces are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question. This explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years. For better ( Rocky Rambo ) or worse ( Die Hard 4 - where John McClane brace yourselves.... had no beard !! ) I say it is high-time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end. This Largo Winch movie is far from perfect and perhaps too predictable at times but at least Tomer Sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action-hero. And the only one time where he was weakened is when Mélanie Thierry shaved his beard ! I rest my case. I didn't know it when I entered the theater room but this might be the movie I've been waiting for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo can a movie be both well- crafted and rooted in B-genre without blushing over its performance. In the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience... In other words it was Le Pacte des Loups or Dobermann ( I like Dobermann mind you )... I believe Largo Winch has what it takes to be both popular and quality film-making. I exited the theater room very pleased and hungry for more. ",positive

" This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I watched it all by luck one night on TV. At first 5 minutes i thought it was a B movie but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was. I suggested to some friends to see the movie only to tell me that it was a bad B movie. How wrong. Superficial critiques. I think that the movie is almost a product of genius! The well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time. ",positive
" Why did it sound like the husband kept calling her Appy ? It ruined a great episode and so I can only give it a 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film. It was very Hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die. The more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining. I do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. 6/10 come on Yankies get your English up to par ! ",positive
" Even though Ian Kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to Hitler's life and yes this is dramatised but essential. Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during his later years during this documentary that only deals with Hitler from boyhood until he became Chancellor of Germany including The Night of the Long Knives. This TV-film (also a two-part mini-series) shows how a series of factors allowed Hitler to come to power e.g. the financial disaster of 1930. The series follows Hitler and little else apart from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all valuable and filled with interesting actors yet I feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography; most actors are portrayed in half-body shots which (for me) makes for a theatrical stance not cinematic. The tempo is at times drowsy and the film does suffer from it being approximately 2 5 hours long. ",positive

" OK so Soldier isn't deep and meaningful like Blade Runner or as big budget as Terminator 2 but on the whole I found it quite enjoyable. The fact that Kurt Russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant. I found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than Arnie's in the T films (and before I get comments yes I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same). So to the film itself a reasonable US/Brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other. Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci-Fi lineage. And the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly. If you see this on your TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance. I don't think you will be disappointed. ",positive
" A year or so ago I was watching the TV news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area. Since then I have paid particular attention to this movie called 'Fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals. Two weeks ago Fido began playing in my local theater. And just yesterday I read a newspaper article which stated Fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release with the exception of our local theater. In fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at The Paramount Theater including 300. Of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up. And for any other locals who haven't seen Fido yet but are considering it I can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize. In fact they make the Okanagan Valley look beautiful. That's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie! However Fido itself is a very good movie. Yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market. Fido is best described as an episode of Lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead. This is a clever premise. And the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold-war paranoia which led to McCarthyism. Furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which George Romero first introduced in Day Of The Dead. K'Sun Ray plays a small town boy who's mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block. However his dad (Dylan Baker) is against the idea as he once had to kill his own 'zombie father'. Eventually the family does acquire a zombie named 'Fido' (played by Billy Connolly) and adjusts to life with the undead. Billy Connolly was inspired casting. He is able to convey Fido's confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts. Connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones. This is his best role since Mrs. Brown. Fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as Shawn Of The Dead and Zombie Honeymoon. Being someone who appreciates Bruce Campbell and Misty Mundae movies more than Eli Roth and Jigsaw ones I prefer humor over gore in my horror. However I understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in Fido. Yet I am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor. The movie does break down in it's third act. It's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s they forgot about the story arc. However given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen I rate Fido 9 out of 10. ",positive
" When I first saw this movie the first thing I thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie. The reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts. The stunts are very much like the Matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far. Another reason why I the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie. The way Gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act VERY ANIME. I think that it's a really good movie to watch. ^_^ The action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde too are a 10). ^_~ If you are Gackt and Hyde fans you have to see it. ",positive
" If you're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'Book of the Dead' 'Book of Eibon' or 'Necronomicon' then you should feel right at home with Malefique a film which also features an occult tome one with the power to change the destinies of all involved. Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished. Finders of the book are Carrère (Gérald Laroche) a company embezzler shopped by his wife Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan the halfwit Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud) who once ate his baby sister and the 'librarian' Marcus (Clovis Cornillac) supposedly driven mad by reading who murdered his wife. Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf's equally bizarre bosomy male in Fight Club (1999) Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet one who is especially protective of the infantile Pâquerette. With the coming of the book however and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents Marcus assumes greater and greater significance. At first assured of an early bail meanwhile Carrère takes little more than academic interest in events. Suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and as the prisoners experiment Danvers' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers... Staged for the most part within a prison cell and between four or five characters Malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter (as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers). Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere. More than anything this is a film about being trapped either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding. I'm going to escape says Carrère at the start of the film wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son. Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape' may not be one a man might imagine. With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does. As critics have noticed it is a film with strong Freudian overtones - Lassalle's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus; Danvers' original placenta fetish; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery' is awaited etc. With so many interesting aspects to the script Vallette hardly puts a foot wrong and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what when one comes down to it is just a matter of four guys four bunks one folding table and a book. There's a genuine growing Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina or what ultimately happens to Pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable. The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions: a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore. Perhaps this is a particularly European manner as one recalls a similar measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven's The Fourth Man (1983) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye. Lensed well in 1.85:1 Malefique benefits from excellent performances and if for this viewer at least the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been the journey to the final shot was worth taking. Coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received Haute Tension (aka: Switchblade Romance 2003) this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the French industry this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from Asia ",positive
" SPOILERS This is a gripping movie about grifters. But who is conning who here? When does the hunter turn into the prey? This gritty dark movie is slow moving and seductive. It pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path only to waylay you just as you think you are safe. It has a riveting script with good acting (at least from the leads). I didn't notice the background music but it was never jarring so it must have been done right. I was very surprised that I liked this movie because I don't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end. ",positive
" It's a gentle easy-going 1950s comedy. Kim Novak belongs to a coven of witches in Manhattan. She puts a spell on neighbor Jimmy Stewart out of boredom but eventually falls in love with him losing her powers. See witches are permitted to have hot blood but not love. Elsa Lanchester is Novak's aunt also a witch. Jack Lemmon is her brother ditto. Hermione Gingold is the chief witch and Ernie Kovacks is Sidney Redlich an author who specializes in writing about witches. I described it as a 1950s comedy because it could hardly be mistaken for anything else. Everything is so smooth and polished from the set decoration through wardrobe and plot to the performances and direction. Take the character of Ernie Kovacks. He's referred to as a drunk and a nut. And here's how the movie demonstrates these traits. He asks for a second drink and though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen his hair is a bit long and tousled. That's a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut. Nothing is out of place; everything is tidy and free of dust. The soles of Jimmy Stewart's shoes are barely scuffed. And the Zodiac Club where the witches hang out. It's called a low dive. Yet it's a clean dark place with polite waiters a quintet of musicians neatly dressed clientèle and potted plants against bare brick walls. That is not my idea or yours of a low dive -- not even for Greenwich Village in 1958. My idea of a dive in Greenwich Village is Julius's or The White Horse Tavern or The San Remo or The Swing Rendezvous a now defunct lesbian hangout. The Zodiac Club is a high dive compared to these. The kookiness we always hear about is muted by today's standards. I mean Kim Novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet. And she wears a lot of black clothes like the Beatniks of the period did. But never mind all that. It's an enjoyable romantic comedy. Kim Novak is effective as Gillian who runs a primitive art shop for the uptrodden. She has a strange beauty bulky and ethereal at the same time. She glides rather than walks a wispy presence. Her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic French curves. And Jimmy Stewart is quite good as the bewildered and bewitched victim. In the 1930s he usually played in light roles. In the postwar years and for much of the 1950s he was the tortured protagonist but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use. Who could resist laughing when Hermione Gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of Novak's spell? It's good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming. Richard Quine directs the movie quietly without fireworks or special effects and does some interesting things that the play couldn't have had. Note the scene in which Novak casts the spell over Stewart when the Siamese cat's face and ears seem to merge with Novak's startling eyes. Ernie Kovacks in the 1950s was a well-known television personality. There was never anything quite like The Ernie Kovacks Show before -- or after. It brings the word surrealism to mind. He could stage five minutes worth of wordless and indescribable tricks in an unpopulated room with only Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra as background. And he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of Percy Dovetail an effete poet. The credits kind of skip over The Condoli Brothers but that's rather casual because these two guys -- Pete and Conte -- were virtuoso trumpeters with independent careers in jazz ensembles. Conte was later a member of Doc Severison's band on Johnny Carson's Late Show. The third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more romantic than comedy . But it's never dull. The whole film rolls along as neatly as Van Druten's play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too. ",positive

" THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) Number 1 - Television Show of all Time Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode. The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time. James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss Tony Soprano accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as the worrying loving upper-middle class mother; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious greying consiglieri who is often very funny. While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi and to an extent this is undeniable I can see so many positives from the show. The portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters? Yes. Furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social inequality and injustice homosexuality drugs etc. This is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real. The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives which makes the whole thing more interesting. Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini for envisioning television's most complex and enigmatic character. Simply exceptional. 10/10 ",positive
" Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film! This version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I was glad that they cast a normal looking actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a glamorous person. I love the sets and the location. For anyone who is a true Jane Eyre fan this is the version to watch!!! For those of you who are interested I just found this version on DVD. I have watched my VHS copy almost to breaking so I was thrilled to find it on DVD. ",positive
" Road to Perdition a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work) a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. This is a terrific movie and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the Michael Sullivan a father of two children played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss played by Paul Newman. His eldest son a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr. perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder committed by John Rooney son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece. I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. My grade 10 out of 10 ",positive
" Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This lush trashy saga is a masterpiece beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. Written on the Wind very obviously influenced the 1980s TV series Dallas and Dynasty as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps. Lauren Bacall wonderfully and subtly plays Lucy Moore a New York City secretary who marries oil baron Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights this is a campy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off Kyle learns he's impotent but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant. This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great. The cast is great although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. He considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What a stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's his Oscar? ",positive
" Its too bad a lot of people didn't understand this and the next episode. But don't worry! ill explain it too you :) This episode is split in 2 parts. first part is Tony's Dream in his coma. Second part is what happens in real life. now what people didn't understand is that Tony's dream is more then just a dream. in this episode its about his preparation for his Death. He loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world. You will notice what I'm saying at the doctor scene where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains his life . They makers really did a superb job of interpreting they're own thoughts of what happens when you die. If you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing with great spiritual meanings. Like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb. Only thing i didn't understand was what the role where of the monks. gonna re watch it till i get this. anyways this episode really touched me and i don't think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience. 10/10 no doubt.

" It is always a nice suprise when a film made for TV turns out to be entertaining such as Little Richard. This is a very watchable film about the story of Rock and Roller Little Richard played by an actor called Leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job. As most TV films this is a little tamer than if made for Cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about Little Richard that was controversial. Instead we see a lot religous rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career. All in all this film is good and the acting is above average fot a TV film. 7 out of 10. ",positive
" I don't think anyone besides Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung makes cinema on a purer level than Claire Denis. That said I don't love this her newest film quite as much as her 2001 masterpiece Trouble Every Day (although it comes very close) which itself is one of my absolute favorite films. It it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too elliptical for it's own good. Don't get me wrong the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it but I think Denis took it about one degree farther than it needed to go and consequently the film does flirt with incomprehensibility and a few key plot points should have been clarified somehow (like that the main character goes to South Korea to get his heart transplant instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there). Also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use actors she likes yet again (Beatrice Dalle's character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance). Still the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing. It is definitely very much a masterpiece in it's own way. At least as good as Denis' more highly-acclaimed Beau travail if not better. Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director at this point better than Leos Carax even. Also I have to admit that the South Korean sequence really does do Lost in Translation better than that film itself does (and I unlike some am a huge fan of that film as well). ",positive
" I knew about but had never seen Grey Gardens before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name. Friends cautioned me that if I had not seen the movie the musical would not make sense. It did but it also prompted me to rent the movie. At first I thought it was a train wreck full of strange shrieking characters and it was exceedingly hard to watch. But being able to stop it digest it and go back to it made me realize why Grey Gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary. Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self-consciousness is worth witnessing. Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age. They have a relationship that will chill any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you re- examine your own dealings with your mother. In an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace it's fascinating to see the Mayleses' work from three decades ago and realize what an impact the film must have had. I echo what other posters have said: how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family? But beyond that how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track which gave me additional insight into the film. ",positive
" We really enjoyed Grey Owl: a simple tale well told in classic Attenborough fashion: a little over-romanticized with archetypes humor and a stress of dignity and values. Beautifully shot and told at a nice pace this is the true story of Archie an Englishman who turned native Indian and went to live and trap in Canada. Solid performances from all makes this film with a message easy viewing. Two of the stars of the film are without a doubt the cutest we have ever seen - and the message is a good one with its ecoleanings. It must have been great to meet or read Grey Owl in the 1930s a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute. ",positive
" Robert Standish's novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a Ceylonese tea plantation... So the events of the Ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to William Dieterle's film... The story is about a rich powerful planter (Peter Finch) who brings a charming and tender beauty (Elizabeth Taylor) into the jungle as his bride... The plantation of course is endangered by some kind of wild life... For this reason Taylor  elegant as never in dazzling costumes  finds herself in a strange atmosphere... The echo determination of a ghost the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father a highly dangerous disease and the fury of wild animals... In her confusion boredom and annoyance Elizabeth Taylor looks to a friendly face a pretentious foreman (Dana Andrews) who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love... With echoes of Jane Eyre the mysterious Yorkshire mansion with a brooding master and Rebecca the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife Elephant Walk is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow exotic dances with rage excessively colorful stampeding big bull elephants amazing mansion set on fire all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent... The movie gave Liz a change of scenery and allowed her more creative energy and self-respect than most of her other willful debutante-rebels The wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will and so Taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for ",positive
" Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star even though he keeps his pants on. The movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life. I don't think I can think of another movie except perhaps Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet that captures that giddy joy that well. The other draw of the movie is the very English eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously. In that sense it is much the same appeal as Midsomer Murder or a Miss Marple mystery without the mayhem. This is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the USA an any relationships between people of different ages. ",positive
" Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive however the director makes good use of the props. The character development is intentionally shallow. The main character Jeremy Northam decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end. ",positive
" The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put the movie was spectacularly average. It's not bad but it's really not very good. The editing is good; the film is well-paced. The direction is competent and assured. The story is plodding. The film is averagely acted by Ledger Bloom and the normally great Watts and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you're from the US so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as I like to call it Orlando Bloom). By the end of the film I was neither bored nor moved. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I have to say I so did not care by that point. Really the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom kind of sort of shows some hints of range (although the oft-present I'm pretty and confused look is prominent) so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price. Other than that just don't see it. It's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining. ",positive
" A favourite of mine this movie tells of two feuding New York characters Steve Brodie(Raft) and Chuck Connors(Beery) who both strive to be the Main Guy in the Bowery in the late Nineteenth Century. Brodie(1863-1901) and Connors(1852-1913) were real people though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics(based on a play).Brodie's legendary(did he do it?- it's still a cause of argument!) jump from the Brooklyn bridge(1886) for which he became famous is shown here as happening around the same time as the Spanish-American war(1898).Director Walsh clearly had a great affection for the period so beautifully recreated here and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer Trixie Odbray(a young Pert Kelton).Raft is at his slickest as Brodie and Beery shows again what a clever actor he was as tough big hearted and at times quite touching Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing. Full of life and energy The Bowery moves at a fast pace(unlike many early talkies ).It is not an easy movie to find but is well worth looking out for. ",positive
" I thought this was an utterly charming film. The story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong does well in the lead but the best performances are by his grandmother Mink Stole (a hilarious cameo) and of all people Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are way off base on this one. They seem to be taking Pecker's worst valuation of his work as gospel when I think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist. ",positive
" Great great great! That is all I can say about that movie but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is soooo cute!) the music was great (The sixties had the best music ever imho) the historical material was interesting and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes and that is the greatness of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: GREAT! ",positive
" What can i say about this movie? I have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6. I have seen the english version and it is done very well.

If you have not seen it you should try to rent a copy you will not be disappointed! ",positive
" Cut is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do. Most of the standard slasher cliches are there; the old creepy house the woods the anonymous indestructible serial killer buckets of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex (that's hardly a spoiler). The set-up is simplicity itself: film-school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast. This also neatly - okay messily - disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel. They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by Molly Ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines. The rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely Jessica Napier who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her. There are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace. It also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate. Good soundtrack too. If there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send-up of or a homage to the slasher genre. Probably a bit of both. ",positive
" Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A Red Scare movie devoid of hysteria in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; unbeknownst to either of them it harbors secrets vital to the Cold War. Peters as it happens was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley. In trying to retrieve the precious film both sides enlist the help of Thelma Ritter a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears. Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality. From the subways to the waterfront his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender and they're scored to Again a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House also starring Widmark. The pace slackens for Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene -- among the most poignant vignettes in all noir and a kind of mirage-oasis in a film parched of sentimentality. This is writer/director Fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle; his later explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono The Naked Kiss Underworld U.S.A.) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street.

" Possibly the most brilliant thing about Che: Part Two as we begin to integrate it with Part One in our minds is that there is no clarification of why Che chose to confidentially abscond from Cuba after the revolution no allusion to his experience in the Congo no clarification of why he chose Bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d'etat no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across South America which Walter Salles has given prominent familiarity. Extraordinary focus is given to Che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions. Yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals to establish involved relationships. He is reasonably unreasonable. Che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind. But there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men. It is the concept. In Part 1 in Cuba the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages given food and cover supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution. Here in Bolivia not much understanding is apparent. Villagers expose him. They protect government troops not his own. When he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system his audience appears uninterested. You cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply. Soderbergh shows U.S. military advisers working with the Bolivians but doesn't fault the United States for Che's collapse. Che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it. In showcasing both wars Soderbergh doesn't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results. Che's men attack and are attacked. They exchange fire with faraway assailants. There is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat its death toll not paused for. This is not a war movie. It is about one man's reasonably unreasonable drive to endure. There is no elaborate cinematography. Soderbergh looks firmly at Che's inflexible dedication. There are remarkable sporadic visceral shots but being few they are all the more powerful such as Che's POV shot during his final beats. There is an abundance of the terrain where these men live for weeks at a time and the all-consuming effect is of languor Guevara himself having malaria part of the time. Benicio Del Toro one of the film's producers gives a champion's performance not least because it's modest. He isn't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes. In Cuba he arises in conquest in Bolivia he falls to the reverse and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair. Del Toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude. You may think the film is too long. I think there's a genuine cause for its breadth. Guevara's affairs in Cuba and particularly Bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane. In the end Che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means.

" I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights) but the resulting movie is definitely interesting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best) but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple) it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. The film is not perfect though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. Anyhow as much as I like this film and the remakes I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book. ",positive
" This is what makes me proud to be British. This is by far the funniest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy dyson Steve pemberton mark gatiss and the lovely Reece shearsmith. Totally underrated this horror-comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre Hello Dave . It is a comedy that everyone simply must watch. The best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh and always pushing the boundaries. It does not need to rely on catchphrases(unlike little Britain) for it to be funny. the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters shows us that they've got balls of steel.

" Since Douglas MacArthur affected more human livesfor the betterthan any other American not elected President he deserved a better film biography. Not that Universal's MacArthur is bad. It's just not all it should have been. Oddly enough the potential was there. From the very early Star Trek episode The Corbomite Maneuver (1966) to the recent HBO films Something the Lord Made (2OO4) and Warm Springs (2OO5) director Joseph Sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors' performances and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go. The producer Frank McCarthy also gave us Patton (197O) the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films and Universal widely touted the fact that the film was four years in preparation and production. Yet for all of this MacArthur is perfectly adequateand not much more than that. The film begins in early 1942 shortly before the beleaguered general was orderedby President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy)to flee the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese. Thus this film omits: · MacArthur's birth in 188O in a frontier barracks in Arkansas still subject to attack by Native American tribesmenthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows-and-arrows to thermonuclear weapons; · his graduation from West Pointfirst in a class of 95 · how he joined his famous father General Arthur MacArthur (who had earned the Medal of Honor at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) on assignments in Japan China and most importantly in the Philippines; · his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into Vera Cruz; · how he leaped about the trenches of World War One like a mountain goat often wounded and promoted with blinding speed to Brigadier General; · his postwar service as West Point's youngestand most progressivecommandant; · his participation in the court-martial of Billy Mitchell in 1924; · his routing of the Bonus Marchers in 1932; · his efforts to sustain a woefully-underfunded Army as Chief of Staff in the early 193O's; · his retirement from the U.S. Army to become Field Marshal (!) of the Army of the Philippines; · and the reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. All this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of MacArthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by PT boatthus we know that General Mac is a legend but not why; nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to Dugout Doug and so patently unfounded. The remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly: His island-hopping Hit 'em where they ain't campaign the fulfillment of his pledge to the Filipinos I shall return! his crowning achievement the winning of the peace in postwar Japan then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (a properly feisty Ed Flanders) over the conduct of the Korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing and finally his proclamation to Congress that old soldierssimply fade away after which he did just that. All quite historically accurate and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary. Sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: If MacArthur's actions appear noble let them be presented as such; if they appear egotistical or bombastic let those conceptions register sans comment. Since Joe Sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience's reactionsagain see Warm Springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional. Historically that may be commendable but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective. And finally there is a sort of made on the cheap feel to the film as there is to Midway released about the same time. Both films were relegated to television directors--Sargent in this case Jack Smight on Midway and both have a made-for-TV-look. Even Jerry Goldsmith's march while perfectly serviceable lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his Patton theme--just another way in which a larger-than-life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film. There was vanity and pettiness in this man inarguably; there was also greatnessand love him or loathe him one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander before him had done: he won the peace. In the end MacArthur like so many film biographiesis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man but a poor place to end it. ",positive
" The first of the Tarzan movies staring Johnny Weissmuller. The plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again. Just know that The actors who play Jane and Tarzan were born for the role. If you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day Tarzan films as a reference..you are missing a Real treat. Doesn't matter how far we've come in movie making makeup set designs...no one will ever play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller did. He was and is Tarzan. ",positive
" Very interesting. The big twist wasn't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working. It really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world I live in a lot more. Charlton Heston does a good job as do all the supporting characters and it was a very realistic film which was surprising. It lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main fault that I could find was that I didn't want the film to end when it did I would have liked to see what happened next. 7/10 ",positive
" Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. We expect a lot more from our movies these days so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford the town nerd. The movie has everything romance tears love death and even sports... It's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century. ",positive
" Yes as unbelievable as it may be in 1968 a musical won the Academy Award for best picture - and it was the third musical to win that award in a five-year period the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady The Sound of Music and Oliver! however is that Oliver! is immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust Oliver!. The acting is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dancing is great. This movie is dynamic topical relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown Gangs of New York Oliver! offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century London England that evokes sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.

" A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read. -Mark Twain 'Classic' seems to be the word used to describe Scarface Brian DePalma's 1983 film about opulence self surrender greed and danger among Florida's drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films.' When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over but not all the praise it gets from audiences today and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public. First off the film is about a Cuban refugee with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma's directing genius and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money but all that has a price as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life when in true dramatic irony they are actually getting worse. 'Tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it's drug usage it's violence it's dialog totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters or brainless action fans. Next on the film is an adult drama. It is not a 'gangster film'. It has it's share of action but the action is plotted very carefully so it has a point. It's not like Aliens - an example of a big dumb action film and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. This being said the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style) which simply could give you chills or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy but it is a story and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in Grease 2 she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina who when she smiles or cries we see her soul and her fresh way of living and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa a drug lord who runs deeper than a river and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. This reviewer learned one main thing when watching Scarface for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap ignore the mindless violence supporters and fix yourself a glass of Bailey's on the rocks and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film the real Scarface.

" You like to solve mysteries? You like complex narrations? This is for you. Brilliant clever movie by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Flashy photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role. The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. Throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him. Not spooky but very mysterious and well played movie. I have my hypothesis on the ending(I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanations. I strongly recommend it 9.5/10 ",positive
" The 60´s is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot. In four deliveries we follow a north American family with 3 members. But we don't only see them. We also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. The filmography is just extraordinary. In the first chapters we see some shots of the Vietnam war in between the scenes. The next chapter doesn't start where the last one finished it starts some time after giving us a little mystery on what happened. In general The 60´s mini series is a must see not only for hippies fanatics but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic. ",positive
" I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special. AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film which i will come to later. For a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while. When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now being 15) I dug out the VHS of homeward bound. After watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain. The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. The films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground something that you all need. The way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic. In that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young American bulldog with sassy the clever vulnerable but confident cat. The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen. I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy painfully are told by him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all. There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This film may not be Lord of the rings but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10. ",positive

" Based on a true story this series is a gem within its kind. The slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village. In the diamond mining town of Tijuco in Brazil the diamond commender--appointed by the king of Portugal--is the ultimate authority. Having grown up in the relative security of his house the young and beautiful Xica da Silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter. In a desperate bid to save herself Xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king intending to use them to escape. The king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day however and when the loot turns up missing the diamond commender is led away in chains his family dispossessed and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs. Martin the diamond commender's son swears vengeance. Xica and the other slaves however are sold at auction and Xica ends up in the home of the Sergeant Major an old man who bought her solely to slake his lust. To the town of Tijuco however comes the new diamond commender the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes. Immediately struck by Xica's beauty he manipulates the Sergeant Major into selling her to him. And thus begins a love story filled with danger intrigue and passion between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queen. The series is filled with rich details of the era's beliefs superstitions politics fashion etc. etc. And it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute. At times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor full of suspense and unexpected twists. Xica da Silva is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD. ",positive
" This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic Oscar contender of a movie it's just some brilliant Bruck-buster action at its best. Fast cars quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. It has everything: Ferraris Mercs a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me! ",positive
" Hidden Frontier is notable for being the longest running internet-based Star Trek fan series. While the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like Starship Exeter or New Voyages Hidden Frontier concentrates largely on story and in that regard it does very well indeed. Hidden Frontier has no physical sets; instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen and the backgrounds inserted digitally. One of Hidden Frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced. One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming instead of in post-production. While this does save a great deal of time it's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production though it still serves its purpose. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea Hidden Frontier is well worth a shot though you might be best to start off watching the third season since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride.

" La Maman et la putain is the beautifulest film of all time. And what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by Proust's A la Recherche du temps perdu . Indeed La Maman et la putain and In search of lost time apparently tell the same story : the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly. The first woman's name is always Gilberte and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of Gilberte : Veronika is like a whore Gilberte beautiful like the night whereas Gilberte was pure and beautiful like the day . After the failure of the first love a second love begins but this one is like already doomed by the first one. Veronika takes the place of Gilberte in Alexandre's life and in the movie. She progressively eclipses her first by time to time Gilberte's still coming when Alexandre waits for Veronika then totally. That shows it's the same sad story repeating itself the same unfaithful woman like Alexandre says who appears endlessly - and unfaithful is for Proust the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also underlines its illusions. Art is what causes the passage between what's outside - the illusion of love - to what's inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth. For instance when Veronika notices the strange way Alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie it's made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed . Alexander wants to live like he was in a film he wants his life to be art. This conception of art comes from Proust with whom Eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art. La Maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political - see for example the ironical review of a political movie by Alexandre. Like Proust says : Art doesn't care for all this proclamations and only exists in silence. First of all art is introspection. And that also why realism or naturalism is rejected : art needs to transform reality to exist. Proust writes : I discover the illusion of realism which is a lie . That's why La Maman et la putain doesn't hide its artificiality underlines by the way the actors say their text : the more you seem artificial the higher you go said Eustache. Eustache and Proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth. But Alexandre failed where Eustache succeed. La Maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is. You can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie which becomes saddest. You can see it in the face of Alexandre who looks more and more like a living-dead. You can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing happens outside. At the end of the movie when you see Alexandre writing and Veronika asking if he's writing his life you can guess that he's not that even literature failed. The end of the movie shows the symbolic death of Alexander who is smashes by the heaviness of reality. And in this tiny nurse's room Alexandre looks more like Albertine than Marcel. To explain this failure we can say that Alexandre is a Balzac's reader. In Forme et signification Jean Rousset explains that in Proust's the readers of Balzac who are Swann and Charlus are unable of any artistic creation because they're stuck in reality which they mistake with art. They see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art . And that's exactly Alexandre. He claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a Bresson's for example . He's like Swann who falls in love with Odette because she looks like a Botticelli's woman. Life is perhaps not my vocation . This thought is indeed by Eustache who committed suicide even if it's said by Alexandre. Nevertheless there is a difference between Alexandre and Eustache : if Eustache is absolutely Alexandre Alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which crystallizes his fears. By fallowing Veronika at the end of the movie Alexandre is condemned to illusions. It's death that remind me the last frames of the movie in the face of Jean-Pierre Léaud as well as in the endless pucking of Veronika. Or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in Sarte's Huit-Clot and absolutely not like in the final liberation of Le Temps retrouvé . If Eustache had read Proust Alexandre could never have finish the book always perturbed by life and Veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafés. La Maman et la Putain is like a inverse double of In search of lost times which tells how Alexander doesn't become an artist whereas A la Recherche du temps perdu tells how Marcel becomes a writer (Genette). If like Baudelaire says an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream it is his nightmare that Eustache tells us in La Maman et la putain . ",positive
" I enjoy movies like this for their spirit no pun intended. Its a decent clean movie about a baseball team that's falling behind and a young fan wishes for them to win since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he'd come back for him. The spirit shines through in two ways: A funny cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the heavenly herald Al taking the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. Its an energetic movie. It gets you smiling and really involves you in the sport. Therein lies my gripe. the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just find it odd that I should come away from the movie thinking the Angels are a strong cool team when really my base loyalty such as it is lies with the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting really. If it's just a movie about an underdog kids team then its okay. ",positive
" It's been quite some time since I've watched this LOTR. I am currently hunting for a copy to purchase. Bakshi's work is quite true to the original work.

But overall -- buy this movie. It's great for kids adults and collectors. ",positive
" Bell Book and Candle was shown recently on cable. Not having seen it for a while we decided to take another look at this comedy. Based on the James Van Druten's Broadway hit which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine who turned the play into a delightful comedy. Evidently judging by some of the comments submitted by IMDb the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars who had collaborated on Vertigo released the same year. Movie audiences didn't think anything about the age difference when this film was released. In fact most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women. The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty as it's clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing. As the witch that becomes human her Gillian is charming. James Stewart who plays the publisher Shep' Henderson is also seen at his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top. In supporting roles the wonderful Elsa Lanchester playing Queenie is a welcome addition to any movie as she proves here. Jack Lemmon's Nicky Holroyd the brother of Gillian is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch. This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching Bell Book and Candle . ",positive
" Don't think of this movies as just another kids movie - the whole family can enjoy it. Its a strange mix of a movie as its seems to have a movie within it but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike modern films!) It does give you all the elements of a film (decent plot good characters - well it does star the Muppets a list of lesser celebs* which films would clamour for) What is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions some sad some heartwarming some funny and some serious - it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together. * The celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine Miss Piggy!!!!

" I love Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role. The movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some Monastery working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline. The acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed-to-be Thailand is eye-catching but Claire Daines steals the entire movie and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world. The flaws are minute and I recommend the film which seems buried sadly forever to rare TV showings. I for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only 10 rated films. Watch it you will be very touched. ",positive
" I have read over 100 of the Nancy Drew books and if you are not bright enough to catch on yet Nancy Drew the movie was of a YOUNGER Nancy Drew not the 18-year-old that doesn't go to school that all of the books are about. This was when she was sixteen. So naturally she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the 10th grade. Other than that I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and appropriate for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate in character and cute. I liked the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books. It was a cute PG movie that I throughly enjoyed because I unlike most people my age enjoy movies without sex drugs or profanity. ",positive

" THE MAN IN THE MOON is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950's. The main story follows a 14-year old girl (Reese Witherspoon) who develops a crush on a 17-year old neighbor (Jason London) who ends up falling for her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family's dynamics forever. The 1950's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately. Witherspoon already begins to show the Oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and London makes a charming leading man. Warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls' parents and Gail Strickland who plays London's mom. I was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase family ties.  ",positive
" Indian Summer is a warm multi-character film that would make a fine afternoon film (with a bit of editing). The film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present when a group of adults from the golden age of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp Uncle Lou. The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp and form new memories in their latest stay. The film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments. Watching these people reminisce and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well. It never goes to over the top and melodramatic always keeping its warmth charm and realism. I've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself. For a warm nostalgic character movie I sincerely recommend. ",positive
" Have never understood why the MacDonald-Eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly--not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone. To me I Married an Angel is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings. The sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an MGM musical the script is by the reliable Anita Loos ( San Francisco The Women Gentlemen Prefer Blondes etc.) the Rodgers and Hart tunes (albeit altered a bit by MacDonald-Eddy regulars Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) are given celestial treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar-winner for scoring The Wizard of Oz ) and best of all the singing sweethearts look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings. Try to show Rose Marie or Sweethearts to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still but this offbeat fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain. ",positive
" I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one. First of all I find this short-film very entertaining and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher. One other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on. No-one else could have done that better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism at its best. Sure I will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer's side will find themselves disappointed. And in good right. Lynch is not about that. At least this side of Lynch is not. The one that helped make Lost Highway/Mulholland Dr. is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else will just not get what this is all about. My opinion is that Darkened Room is all about messing with your animal-core your instinctual self by giving you the means (image sound situation) by which you instinctively react. It's not about pleasure of any kind it's about getting the desired reaction out of you. And that my friend is pure art. ",positive
" I am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the so bad it's good type of viewing. However I really like this film for its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation. The whole thing has a ring of John Waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a text-book lesson in how to use movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars. You may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars. Highly reccomended. ",positive
" It does not seem that this movie managed to please a lot of people. First off not many seem to have seen it in the first place (I just bumped into it by accident) and then judging by the reviews and the rating of those that did many did not enjoy it very much. Well I did. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and his charm and even though I did not consider him a great actor I know he can do crazy pretty well (I liked his Mr Jones). But this performance is all different. He is not pretty in this one and he is not charming. His character is completely different from anything I had seen from him up to that point---old ugly broken determined. And Gere in what to me is so far his best performance ever pulls it off beautifully. I guess it is a sign of how well an actor does his job if you cannot imagine anyone else doing it instead---think Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter or Washington as Alonzo in Training Day. That is how good Gere was here. The rest of the cast were fine by me too. I guess I would not have cast Danes in this role mostly because I think she is too good-looking for it. But she actually does an excellent job holding her own with a Gere in top form which is no small feat. Strickland easily delivers the best supporting act in a part that requires a considerable range from her. I actually think she owns the key scene with Gere and Danes and that is quite an achievement. So what about the rest of the movie apart from some excellent acting? The story is perhaps not hugely surprising some 8mm-ish aspects to it but adding the veteran breaks in rookie storyline to the who-dunnit and also (like Silence of the Lambs) adding a sense of urgency through trying to save the girl and the impending retirement of Gere's character. All that is a backdrop to the development of the two main characters as they help each other settle into their respective new stations in life. That's a lot to accomplish in a 100 minutes but it is done well and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to them. Direction and photography were adequate. I could have done without the modern music-video camera movements and cutting but then I am an old curmudgeon and it really wasn't all that bad in fact I think it did help with the atmosphere of the movie which as you might have guessed by and large isn't a happy one. Worth seeing. ",positive
" Considering all the teen films like the Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink that are lionized. It is surprising that this one is so ignored. There is no sex in it but sex is thought of including the idea that it may matter what others think about it. The kids do not always get along with their parents but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong and the parents are not seen as monsters. It deals with hero-worship. How one girl does a dangerous thing which could have lead to real dustier before realizing that she was wrong. The movie is kind of ahead of its' time. One kid asks another kid what birth control she uses. She says she is doing nothing to need birth control. She replies (wrongly) oral sex . ",positive
" In 1993 with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie originally slated for Direct-To-Video but bumped up to theatrical status. It would become known as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the WB Sub-Zero Return of the Joker and now Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family. The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman has begun targeting operations run by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin. Now Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the line. The animation is the sleeker futuristic style that was utilized for Batman: The Animated Series' fifth and sixth seasons (AKA The New Batman Adventures). it's quite nicely done and just as sleek as Return of the Joker's animation. There is also some use of CGI but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in Sub-Zero. The music was alright. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent-shaped hearts. Kevin Conroy as always does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also great to have the old Batman: The Animated Series alumni back; that includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon) Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock) Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon/Batgirl; her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and Bruce that was mentioned in Batman Beyond) and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.(Alfred). Villains were also great - especially given that Rupert Thorne the old mob boss from the original series appears for the first time since the fourth season. Overall while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films. And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan you will love the five-minute short Chase Me. ",positive
" I caught Evening in the cinema with a lady friend. Evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such but I can say with some relief that it's not so infused with estrogen that it's painful for a red-blooded male to watch. Except for a single instance at the very end of the movie I watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self-indulgent melodrama. Ladies for their part will absolutely love this movie. Ann Lord is elderly bed-ridden and spending her last few days on Earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side. Discomfited by the memories of her past Ann suddenly calls out a man's name her daughters have never heard before: Harris. While both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother's strong urge to recall and redress her ill-fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times Ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met Harris - and in doing so lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with. Both Ann and her two daughters - one married with children one a serial commitophobe - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists and perhaps more importantly if true love can endure the test of time. Are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever? Will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome? The subtle fact that the aged Ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters. The cinematography for Evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in Ann's mind as she recalls the past and for that reason I think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed to give everyone an ethereal glow (and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real but occurred in the past). Claire Danes is beautiful (appearing to be really really tall though just 5' 5 in reality) and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test. You can't really talk trash about the cast which leads off with Claire Danes and doesn't let up from there: Vanessa Redgrave Patrick Wilson Meryl Streep and Glenn Close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film. I can't really say anything negative about this film at all though Hugh Dancy's struggle to have his character emerge from utter one-dimensionality is in the end a total loss. Playing the spoiled lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn't offer much in the way of character exploration - he had his orders and stuck to them. In the end gentlemen your lady friend will most certainly weep and while you'll likely not feel nearly as affected the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching Evening. Catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of Die Hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo flick. It'll be your little secret that this viewing didn't really cost you much at all. ",positive
" This is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class their problems relationships and interactions with each other. It should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time. The swimming instructor is an almost-Olympian reduced to teaching adults basic lessons and often the target of horndogging from his female students. He attempts more or less to fend them off with varying results. The students characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers policemen college students and retired people all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships including friends relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. Several subplots provide amusing fodder including a teacher going through a divorce some high school students making a documentary and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys. This is a good date movie or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality. ",positive
" The combination of reading the Novella and viewing this film has inspired my wife and I to new levels. Recently I was pondering a statement made by the artist Thomas Kinkade in one of his inspirational books; He states: You and I were not designed to breathe the fetid air of five o'clock traffic. Nor do I think God had banal television programs media hype worthless purchases and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe... I hadn't seen A river runs through it in a couple of years but after pondering Kinkade's statement something drew me to watch the film with a spiritual eye. I watched it and saw a whole new world to the film and it inspired me to read the book (a must read). I have always been frustrated in Southern California but somehow got caught up in its materialistic society. The film really puts into perspective of how we should really experience God's creations. A combination of Macleans story and my desire to move back to the Northwest has driven me to move to Montana. I want my future kids to be able to rome the landscape go fly-fishing with me ride horses into nothing but open land and serene lakes set in the mountainside. A place where you seldom worry about crime. I look around SoCal and all I see is shopping malls rude snarling people in their Mercedez Bens miles of vehicles on congested freeways gangs racial turmoil on the verge of violent eruption and everyone skeptical of each others intentions. Anyway the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones. There is a lot of deep thinking in this film. The scenery is worth seeing alone and actually helps relieve tension. You should finish this film relaxed yet full of insights to your own life. It takes a compassionate intelligent and spiritual person to really grasp the meaning. If you don't understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue tone light colour scenery camera angles/movement etc. Then this film is probably not for the crowd that thinks The Fast and the Furious is the greatest film. Granted it was entertaining but shallow. The bottom line: This film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what things you posses. Rather it is about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together. QUALITY NOT QAUNTITY ",positive
" Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short movies i.e. music videos are simply the best. I do not care if I get a sane sci-fi feature from this man but I do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing shriek yells cool crowd choreography and some bits of CGI and animation. There also should be a few uninterrupted videos. Everything I've mentioned is here. Stupid plot and over-the-top vanity fair are not a problem when I witness Mr Michael Jackson in action. To me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos (not king of pop which sounds moronic especially for us Russians because pop sounds like the Russian word for arses and MJ is definitely not king of arses ). I can re-watch his best music videos (which are artistically beautiful) and I never get tired of them. My first impression of this film was What is this...? (bits of different videos some drawn images unsettling jumps from one theme to another absence of any cohesive plot line some kids fooling around etc.) but as I watched it till the end I could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on TV nowadays. What I like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily. Without Mr Michael Jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor. Even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of MJ musical insanity and artistic quality. He knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles. When I see a proper DVD release with Mr Michael Jackson videos I know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release. HIStory I HIStory II and Moonwalker are all great though only Moonwalker is more like one movie (with a solid Smooth Criminal theme paparazzi topic and a few weird spoofs and twists). Being no fan of MJ I can still give this film... like no other a solid 9 out of 10 (I've been hit by Smooth Criminal for sure and my major complains are the following: initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main MJ anti-drug campaign should have been given more sky-rocketing insanity and stress and there should have been more moonwalking itself of course). Thanks for attention. ",positive
" Picked up the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks sure did get my moneys worth!.

" A typical romp through Cheech and Chong's reality which includes drugs singing more drugs cars and driving even more drugs Pee Wee aliens gasoline laundry stand up comedy surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !!. It is not as coherent or plausible as Up in Smoke but it still is incredibly funny without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work. Also funny is Cheech's song (Mexican-Americans) and Chong's follow up song. Another notable scene is the welfare office scene with Jones (human noise machine) from the Police Academy series and the old laughing man. All in all this is a great follow up to Up in Smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not. -Celluloid Rehab ",positive
" I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary. The musical score cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an Imax production. Even though it is shot for those huge Imax theaters it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system. The subject is also so fascinating. It is about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the CART Championship F1 Championship The Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son. The first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that Mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection. The other car is Michael's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season. Imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating. Paul Newman who was Michael Amoretti's team owner at the time this movie was made narrates the film. His anecdotes and witticism drawn from many years as an owner and driver lends much to the production. The main feature is the race scenes. Turn up the volume here! There is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! The final magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world Mario Andretti is loving father who proudly watches over his son's career. They work together so well that every father and son should see this. You can tell that they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience. ",positive
" Across the country and especially in the political landscape people with any kind of political ambition should take time out to see this film. The movie is called City Hall and with little imagination its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It just so happens to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort. His right-hand man is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) an equally bright individual who's ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office. Everything points in that direction until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor. A six year old boy and a police officer's death are blamed on a career criminal who's questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up by political pay-offs and city corruption involving union leaders like Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo corrupt judicial officials like Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also implicated are party officials like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works for the probation office of New York. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. **** ",positive
" The wit and pace and three show stopping Busby Berkley numbers put this ahead of the over-rated 42nd Street.

" There are some comments about this film that say that it is a bad and silly one and such an excellent actor as Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted to act in it. I think just the opposite that even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so formidable that it converts the film in something excellent. His performance is probably the best in history. The film itself has a very polemic scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret. For somebody who does not believe that a priest  even a defrocked one  can convert it in Christ's blood the scene is perhaps bizarre. But for somebody who has been raised in a catholic framework it is very emotive even if quite unpleasant. The scene of the death of the younger priest is tremendously shocking. But it is very well acted. Pierre Fresnay turns the crazy act of murder in something understandable within the temporal madness of his character the tortured defrocked Morand who in this terrible way comes back to his duty.

" Paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film I've ever seen. Often classed as a horror movie this I believe is a grave error. Some journo once called it the thinking person's Nightmare on Elm Street and while I accept the logic of his conclusion I can't help but think it's a tag that is ill deserved and misleading. Those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they're really not thinking at all. In fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Quite simply Paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing. To be honest I make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste stop reading now because there's more to come. It's so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives. Even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of Paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked) in a seamless and convincing way. And yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away. Add to all this an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose) imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you're ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why I have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express.

" Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this sterling example of brotherly love and commitment. Hulce plays Dominick (Nicky) a mildly mentally handicapped young man who is putting his 12 minutes younger twin brother Liotta who plays Eugene through medical school. It is set in Baltimore and deals with the issues of sibling rivalry the unbreakable bond of twins child abuse and good always winning out over evil. It is captivating and filled with laughter and tears. If you have not yet seen this film please rent it I promise you'll be amazed at how such a wonderful film could go un-noticed. ",positive
" I had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this film I'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture. Kudos to the cast for their terrific performances (that little girl was gold) and to whoever composed the music. The warped Row Your Boat blew me away. Very creative film all around....I really hope to see it come out on video or DVD because I'd buy it in a second. If you get the chance you should definitely see this film. ",positive
" Even though we know how the story ends this is a gripping fly-on-the-wall film that plays almost like a political thriller. During the calm before the storm we meet Hugo Chavez as a charismatic larger than life man who has an unbreakable connection with the mestizos who make up 80% of the population but have previously been shut out of Venezuela's political process and its oil wealth. He seems as devoted to them as they are to him. He travels the country at a hectic pace reaching out to the campesinos addressing huge crowds hugging and kissing ordinary people accepting letters on scraps of paper and hearing pleas for help. The people are excited that one of their number has made it to the highest office in the land. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is coming to the festering barrios. But not everyone is happy with the situation. The pure-blood Castillian Spaniard elite who are a small minority but previously controlled all the wealth are full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in the film is when an Ann Coulter lookalike at a residents' meeting in an exclusive gated community complains of the mestizos they have no concept of struggle or sacrifice. Minutes later a speaker tells the meeting to beware of your domestic servants - they could be Chavez supporters. Duh! Of course they are. In a late night interview alone with the film crew Chavez reveals something of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather. He can be a sensitive poetic person though with an impish even clownish sense of humor (like we saw when he addressed the UN and called Bush the devil.) Then the storm starts to gather force as the coup organizers call for a mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters into changing the route at the last minute and marching on the presidential palace knowing it is surrounded by Chavez supporters and violence is inevitable. Another element of the plot falls into place as snipers on rooftops begin to fire on the Chavez supporters some of whom fire back. The local equivalent of Fox News shows this return fire and claims that Chavez supporters are massacring protesters. Then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The protesters took a different route. Needless to say the footage of the empty street was edited out by the rabidly anti-Chavez private TV stations (who had been airing a constant barrage of propaganda calling Chavez mentally ill and sexually fixated on Fidel Castro.) Immediately after the coup we see the ringleaders and their media propaganda masters openly bragging on TV about how they had manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents alike. The filmmakers continue to be at the heart of this chaotic fast-changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. Chavez eventually surrenders to avoid bloodshed but refuses to resign and is whisked away to an offshore island where a plane awaits to take him - where? The US? How can the remaining cabinet members avoid arrest and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-wealthy businessmen who are closely linked to the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! If your only knowledge of Hugo Chavez and Venezuela is from the US media then you know nothing. He is not an unelected tyrant and does not rule by decree - he is enormously popular having been elected and re-elected several times with over 60% of the vote (something George Bush Junior has never achieved) and the devotion he inspires in ordinary Venezuelan people is ultimately the reason why the coup fails. This is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The skill of the filmmakers is in being unobtrusive and letting the story unfold through the voices of Venezuelans at every level from the barrio to the presidential palace the tumultuous scenes the chaos and confusion out of which a coherent whole emerges that is tense riveting and moving. Not to be missed! ",positive

" The comparison to Sleuth the earlier stage-play-turned-film is obvious and upon my first viewing I too thought Sleuth was better but Deathtrap has at least for me many more repeat viewings in it than Sleuth. I purchased Deathrap in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart figuring that it had Caine and the underrated Reeve and was worth the 6 bucks. It was one of the finest DVD purchases I could've picked up. It's one of those best-kept-secrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover. And it's totally worth repeat viewings. Though Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine turned in bravado performances in Sleuth I was doubly impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve rightfully associated with his now legendary portrayal of Superman stole the show in what should've been an Oscar worthy performance. I've always felt Reeve was a type-cast actor who didn't get much of a chance to shine outside of the Superman films and a few other flawed but entertaining films like Somewhere in Time but this film shows that his potential was truly tapped and put to use thank goodness. I absolutely relished Michael Caine's performance. He was glib deliciously manipulative and sadistic. And watching him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact it was thanks to this movie that I got into a Michael Caine phase and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible. As for Deathtrap there's enough juicy dialogue in here to fill up its memorable quotes section. (Unfortunately much of the dialogue would inherently spoil the immensely entertaining plot). It's really really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own. Needless to say it's a must-see. But for me it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time. Repeat viewings are a must. And it deserves to sit alongside Sleuth on your DVD shelf. I'll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film: I wonder if it wouldn't be...well...just a trifle starry-eyed of me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration...where I could count on no sense of moral obligation...whatsoever.

" All Dog's Go to Heaven is an animated kid's movie like no other. Gambling drinking death guns and Hell are all prominent in the plot and though kids will get very little of it adults will be scratching their heads as to why this movie was made to feel like some sort of gangster movie. The actual movie isn't explicit in any way it's just an odd combination to make a kid's movie on. Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog who owns half a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After getting drunk (A dog....getting drunk...in a kid's movie. It just sounds weird.) Charlie is tricked and murdered by Carfax. When in heaven he finds a way to come back to Earth but he will no longer be allowed in Heaven. He still goes back to Earth and meets up with his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise) and plans payback on Carfax. Meanwhile Carfax has a little orphan girl Anne Marie held captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals which helps predict races. Charlie and Itchy free her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about themselves. This movie is one of the few non-Disney that will appeal to both kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation while adults will enjoy the nice sweet plot and the more than normal developed characters. One thing that keeps this down is that it's a musical. Normally that's a good thing but the music here is honestly terrible. They tend to jump around almost sounding ad libbed with next to no instrumental backing. In fact these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated movie but luckily the rest of the film is strong enough to not fall apart because of some bad notes. The ending of this movie works but I honestly hate it. It's sad but happy but more sad than happy and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel. Considering how bad the sequel made to this was I wish the ending wouldn't have warranted a sequel and it would've wrapped up into a nice super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I feel this way about but I do. Overall this is a nice family film with odd themes thrown in but nonetheless good entertainment. My rating: *** out of ****. 85 mins. G.

" This was a delightful presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity arrogance snobbish superiority and innocent wonder. The quote (or scene) I recall vividly is when Hemo tires of all this plumbing ... you haven't learned my secrets at all and threatens to storm out the Scientist answers him in a single word Thalassa -- salt water which horrifies the Fiction Writer but mollifies Hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood. Such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released. Stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning. ",positive
" Originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Dudley Moore 'Not Only...But Also' saw his ex-'Beyond The Fringe' collaborator Peter Cook guest on the first show and so well received was it the controller of B.B.C.-2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on. They were a classic comedy team - Cook was tall handsome and witty while Dudley was short charismatic and musically gifted. The sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub wearing flat caps and mufflers fantasising about movie stars such as Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time and even when Cook corpses it still holds together well. Those characters - idiot Pete and even-bigger idiot Dud - found their way into every episode of the show proper seen in a different setting such as a zoo or an art gallery. In the latter they munched sandwiches while discussing works of art. That Leonardo DaVinci cartoon...I don't see the joke! says Dud. Pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits. Dud nearly chokes on his repast. You really are enjoying those sandwiches! ad libs Cook. The pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold. The sketches themselves set new standards for comedy standards that would not be matched until the arrival of 'Monty Python'. As the show's popularity increased so did the quality of the guest stars. Peter Sellers for instance and John Lennon the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem 'Deaf Ted Danoota & Me'. 'One Leg Too Few' - had Dud as 'George Spigott' ( a name later re-used in the film 'Bedazzled' ) a one-legged man who hops into the office of film producer Cook to audition for the role of 'Tarzan'. Cook tries to let him down as best as he can. I've nothing against your right leg! he says. The trouble is - neither have you! . Dud would on occasion interview the eccentric Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling ( Cook ) who when he was not teaching ravens to fly underwater was planning on opening a restaurant called 'The Frog & The Peach'. Another classic was 'The Leaping Nuns' ( also reused in 'Bedazzled' ). But my all-time favourite has to be 'Superthunderstingcar' a wickedly funny ( and accurate ) parody of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's 'Thunderbirds'. Pete and Dud played all the roles with the latter making a fetching 'Lady Penelope'. 'Ludwig' had Ludwig Van Beethoven as the star of a 'This Is Tom Jones' style variety show. 'The Immortal Bargo' was a spoof documentary on the life of reclusive movie star 'Emma Bargo'. In an unforgettable moment she drove through London bellowing through a loudhailer: I want to be alone! . A Season 3 feature was 'Poets Cornered' with the likes of Ronnie Barker Spike Milligan Barry Humphries Willie Rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank. They each had to improvise the line of a poem and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff. Three seasons were made in all produced ( at different times ) by Joe McGrath Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Sadly very few editions survive. To make matters worse the scripts were destroyed as well. It beggars belief that this situation was allowed to happen. The show ended in 1970. The comics then hit Broadway made the infamous 'Derek & Clive' tapes but Cook's ever-increasing alcoholism broke them apart. Eight years later Cook announced that a new series was in the offing but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part. His ex-partner was making films in America and had no intention of working with Cook again ( not at that time anyway ). Enough footage was scraped together for a season of B.B.C.-2 repeats in the early '90's. As expected some items had not held up as well as others. Cook died in 1995 and by way of a tribute the B.B.C put together a programme compiled from various 'Parkinson' interviews and 'Not Only...But Also' shows. It ended rather appropriately with Pete and Dud finding themselves in Heaven. Bloody Hell! exclaimed the latter. Moore passed on in 2002. ",positive
" Clara Lago is wonderful as the title character of the film essentially a film about a Spanish/American girl who moves to Spain with her mom at the time of the Spanish Civil War. It turns out the mother goes home to die and she is left with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences much in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is at first a nuisance to her then they become close. The film is shot beautifully bathed in soft colors mostly. Carol yearns for her dad who is a pilot in the war and you can feel the love sher has for him. While the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film it envelops the character's lives. I think you'll like it. See it especially for Clara Lago who does a great job as Carol. She is definitely one to watch. ",positive
" I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime or Cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents subscribed to those channels. I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark bizarre and fascinating. I was young then in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by Big Bad Love I bought the DVD of Wilder Napalm and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years. I absolutely loved it! I was really impressed and affected by it. There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads their story the music and all the other actors as well. It's truly Cinematic . I love Arliss Howard's subtle intensity ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence I'm a big fan of anything he does; and his interplay with Debra Winger's manic glee (they are of course married) has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera. (I wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries?....... Big Bad Love should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; it's brilliant.) And Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up sneakily introduced angled hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often. Quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways with that huge slit mouth span hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both). Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion. In fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity. It's really a fantastic film put together by intelligence imagination agility and chemistry by all parties involved. I really cannot imagine how this got funded and it looks pretty expensive to me by such a conventional imagination-less system but I thank God films like this slip through the system every once in awhile. In a great way with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors hip intelligence darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: Grosse Pointe Blank .......now that's a compliment in my book!

" Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence overheated sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood. I don't award many tens. This one richly deserves it!

" I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this was playing at the cinema I couldn't help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen's work) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop's most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson's performance but I am a bit bias I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. She plays a ditsy yappy bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen's stereotypical neurosis stricken character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character sickeningly cute and that is a plus. Allen is Allen... He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late... Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect. I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less. In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh... In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective-like than anything. However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray. Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt. Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners. I did find his allusions to his last film interesting... Come for the humor laugh and be merry. Needless to say if you enjoy Allen's work watch it. If not watch something else... ",positive
" Maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best Jackie Chan's movies but I think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made. There also was some memorable stunts which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. This movie influenced many other action movies and I think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film (like they could remake that chase scene I thing with modern technologies they could make it even better). There also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie wasn't fighting. Althou I think they could put more fighting scenes in this film. ",positive
" Firstly I would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors. Anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly utter nonsense. Creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects. The actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing. There is much mystique in this film. Many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels. How was 'Craig' created and what happened to him? A fantastic film with a large chill factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later The Bunker Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. Look forward to more of these fantastic films!! ",positive
" I had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But the performances from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary almost stunning and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker. Carter's depiction of an ALS victim is strong perhaps even overdone at times (sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. Branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance. ",positive
" What makes for Best Picture material? The Oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come. It wasn't because Hollywood was against art or creativity. The Academy Awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative minds. The Arthur Freed unit at MGM had been bound for Oscar-winning glory for several years by this point; it was only a matter of time before Freed aided by his strongest director Vincente Minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a Best Picture. Freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals. The point about Freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of Hammerstein or Lerner don't have to tell or even relate to the stories. What's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film. An American in Paris was the first of three Freed musicals (the other two being Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon) which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story. The words don't fit the plot but the routines fit the show. So when Gene Kelly sings I Got Rhythm he hasn't even got a girl yet but the way it's done with the French kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point. An American in Paris also uses the rule-breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of Leslie Caron's character. And what better director for this project than Minnelli himself a painter and a pianist? At this time there wasn't really anyone who had a better feel for Technicolor. While some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades Minnelli's colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced. In the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red. During Oscar Levant and Georges Guetary's meeting in the café a few more vibrant shades are introduced. Then during the first musical number By Strauss Minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red  a table cloth a bunch of roses  until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the picture's colour scheme. For most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people. However in some numbers such as Tra-la-la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated. The Achilles' heel of An American in Paris is its story. I personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s; the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero. Even if you don't mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances. Compare this to Singin' in the Rain which doesn't really have as many great routines or memorable set-pieces as An American in Paris but it has a winning storyline. Singin' in the Rain was overlooked at the 1952 Oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today. But I think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all-encompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story. An American in Paris is not deep or engaging or tear-jerking but like a certain DeMille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show. ",positive
" dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is great. this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong. raptor island is a work of art. i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER.

" Let me start by saying at the young age of 34 I was suddenly widowed. I was devastated as he was NOT sick--- he died unexpectedly basically of a coronary--- his carotids blew out-- he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation from police cause he fell on something and it bashed his head in. I was a suspect for murder until the autopsy came back. My children were as traumatized as I was so in love with a good father figure as he. I had three small children no education no financial support. I took it very very hard. Within two years my in-laws attacked me verbally physically emotionally and spiritually demanding I grieve not in front of the children and put on masks and showed people what they wanted to see not show them my pain during holidays... Nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit out one holiday except of course the grief therapist I was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul. My in-laws didn't get it! It changed FOREVER my relationship with them and I have never been back for a holiday. This is only one example of how my grief was disrespected! My own (new) husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when I shared from my soul. I collapse can not breathe hyperventilate and generally am defunct for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain. Now about this movie... Today my soul was stirred my heart broken. My fears and pain re-surfaced from the real demons this movie presents; how one grieves compared to how others expect us too and the demons within. Adam Sandler portrayed perfectly the horrendous agony you face overcome and most of all work through on your own time! This movie dredged up all the pain that I have tried over the years to deal with. You see when something harms your soul so profoundly so deep that utterances are all that come from your mouth in moments of thinking you can not deal with it without wishing you were dead and walking through life in a dead state. The bible has a scripture Romans 8:26 that I have clung to that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for that God's Holy Spirit carries that agony to the feet of God-- I need not speak. Sandler portrayed that to perfection! There is a scene where he has been hauled into a court hearing for mental health commitment purposes and he goes back in to face his in-laws--- (familiar to me)--- and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by per Se that he can't get over. It's a profoundly strong and mighty performance. I started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw it first hand my precise motions while trying to hold it all together; a lesson for him my youngest who barely remembers his daddy. It's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my in-laws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrendering to their desires instead of respect to my own. I write this so that if you are a griever you are prepared for this movie but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance Sandler gave. If you are not yet a griever please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people's choices in their grief letting them find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain. Go see this movie with tissues and not without preparing to take it in... to your soul! ",positive
" I'm still new to the Krimi genre and the only one I've seen prior to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing 'The Dead Eyes of London' which didn't exactly inspire a great hope for the rest of the genre in me. If I'd seen this one first however the feeling would have been different as while The College Girl Murders is a bizarre and rather wacky attempt at a crime flick; it's great fun to watch and it's really hard to hate a film that throws so many weird and wonderful ideas into the script and manages to pull it off with style. The film begins in a lab where a crazy scientist has invented a new and highly toxic poison that kills its victim and makes it look like they died from a heart attack. This poison is used by a mysterious criminal mastermind who breaks common criminals out of jail to carry out his murders using this poison (and then has them put back in jail). As the title suggests it's a nearby college full of girls that provides most of the victims. There's also a mysterious monk dressed in a red robe who marauds around breaking necks with a bullwhip. Of course with a plot like that; this is not exactly a serious affair and the director clearly knows that as there is a very tongue-in-cheek vibe to the film which does bode well with the plot. The fact that there are so many different sides to the plot does unfortunately mean that everything does not run smoothly; although this isn't a big problem as things are kept ticking over nicely throughout the film and there's always enough going on to keep the audience interested. The atmosphere is superb and the colour scheme on display is great too look at. Of course the film is based on an Edgar Wallace novel and clearly the man has a great imagination; the locations used are also superb and while a killer's lair decked out with a host of wild and exotic animals might not serve any relevance to the plot it does help to give the film that extra 'something'. You cant expect a conclusion that fully makes sense after all the stuff that goes on in this film; but the reason for the murders sort of makes sense and is a satisfying way for the film to climax. Overall College Girl Murders is an excellent little mystery flick and one that comes highly recommended! ",positive
" This film is shockingly underrated on IMDb. Like so many films this isn't Shawshank. But it's a reasonably good if predictable dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 Mile for a female step dancer than I think you'll like it. Judging from the IMDb ratings my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 and was vote bombed with many 1s as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob don't have special effects or include non-white or non-straight characters. It's an American film but it's not a US film. Set mostly in Toronto the cues are subtle and some audiences may think it's set entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit. I liked the music. I liked the dance (but not convinced it's worth $50 000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy on the eyes. I do agree the title sucks. I don't remember anyone in the film saying those words and it should have an s . (No it's not a foreign language). There's not a lot to hate about this film (and let's be honest a vote of 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it and that's sad.

" there is a story but more essentially the world of this film begins in chaos and comes to order over the course of ten minutes. it is a celebration of life and an optimistic assertion of objective truth and good. representing along an axis unexplored in previous cinema this film should be taught in every high school. *CHIASMUS* ",positive
" I really enjoyed this movie. The acting by the adult actors was great although I did find the main kid a little stiff. But he carried himself very well for being a new talent. The humor is very sublime and not in your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. I.e. The Nutty Professor. If you have a short attention span and are used to the typical Hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced. I picked it up on Blu-ray and I have to say the image quality is top notch. Probably one of the better looking Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were cool too. They deleted quite a bit but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything. ",positive
" Yes Keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film. With a skip in his step in his tailored pin-striped suits he'll remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young hood who only does it to pay for his mother's high-priced medical bills & to send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to law school. No one even knows Johnny Kelly IS Johnny Dangerously until later on in the film. Joe Piscopo is Vermin & doesn't like Johnny one bit (& I don't like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a nice singing/dancing routine while Johnny revels in it. I love the part when they're in the ever-changing getaway car! The cop who's calling all cars is the Skipper from Gilligan's Island! See this one for 1930's gangster laughs! The gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you'll miss them! Look in the background of every scene. ",positive
" I noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and I too didn't have high hopes for it. I figured it was another You Got Served type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting. I was at the theater and deciding between this and Meet the Spartans and picked this. To my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good. The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage posted on here I recommend going to see a matinée showing of this movie so you don't spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it. When it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. Hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released. edit The movie is now moving closer to its correct rating. Over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1. ",positive
" One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism the highly atmospheric style of film-making developed during the 20s in Berlin. Classic movies like Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari. (1920) and Nosferatu Eine Symphonie Des Grauens (1922) were the most famous direct results of this movement and while the movement didn't have a long life its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today specially in the horror genre. One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener director of 1920's Der Golem Wie Er in die Welt Kam as in his debut as a filmmaker seven years before the making of that classic he was already making experiments with expressionism in film. That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally another horror film: Der Student Von Prag . Der Student Von Prag ( The Student of Prague ) is the story of Balduin (Paul Wegener) a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague but who always find himself with financial troubles. One day Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit (Grete Berger) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident. Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again but soon he discovers that he'll have to compete with her rich cousin Graf Von Schwarzenberg (Lothar Körner) who also wants to marry her. Knowing that he can't offer her much Balduin wishes to be wealthy and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli (John Gottowt) enters the scene. Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room. Balduin accepts the proposal only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror. Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's short story William Wilson and the classic legend of Faust the story of Der Student Von Prag was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature. Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form Der Student Von Prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes. Like most of the scriptwriters of his time Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater although Der Student Von Prag begins to move away from that style. While a bit poor on its character development (specially on the supporting characters) Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduin. While Der Student Von Prag was Paul Wegener's directorial debut and Stellan Rye's second film as a filmmaker it's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly. Giving great use to Guido Seeber's cinematography the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do. Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his Golem series from Seeber and Rye. Despite having very limited resources Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing (for its time) visual effect for the scenes with Balduin's reflection (played by Wegener too). Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers. As Balduin Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie. It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one can't deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract. John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove. Few is said about Scapinelli in the film but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared. The rest of the main cast is less lucky with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit and Lothar Körner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg. However it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron Waldis-Schwarzenberg showing the dignity that Lörner's character should have had. Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake (made 13 years after this film) is superior in every possible way it's not difficult to understand why Der Student Von Prag hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films. The movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers' story needed to be fully developed. This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even incomplete as if there was something missing in the narrative (of course there's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete). However Der Student Von Prag is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in history. As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement it's hard to deny the enormous importance that Der Student Von Prag has in the history of German cinema probably in the history of cinema in general. It may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had it's truly better than most films from that era. As the movie that started Paul Wegener's career and with that German expressionism Der Student Von Prag is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history. 7/10 ",positive
" I remember liking this more than Nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me. Laputa whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid confusion to its wide Hispanic audiences has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production Conan. In fact Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan--who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet then started running. This makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch. The techie fans of Nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out Laputa--the only exception may be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds the theme in Laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism. If it has a theme at all it's anti-warfare. The importance of living naturally--this is related with the flying castle is dismissably shortly discussed and not really followed through. Overall I now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny. ",positive

" This show is awesome! I have been a fan since it premiered and it only keeps me watching... I've seen some terrible things here that I wish I hadn't BUT it really shows you how addiction affects all involved not just the addict. You can see all kinds of different addictions from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict or the eating disorder addict. And actually it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also. We've seen accomplished musicians an NBA player and even young people who really need the help. And since they have started showing a few follow-ups that's been awesome too. Now you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired. If you haven't checked this one out please do. It's on A&E and it's awesome! The new eps are Sunday nights at 10PM EST if I remember correctly... so set your TiVo! ",positive
" This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it great especially are two things: one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes with discussions of their costumes and superpowers. There's an endearing earnestness to the parody that's very appealing; the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves particular note as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There's a boatload of talent here. I realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed but this movie is a lot of fun and kind of sweet. ",positive
" Polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby in The Tenant. The atmosphere is trademark Polanski - dark brooding unnerving - but there is something awkward about this movie and I am not sure whether or not it is deliberate. Sven Nykvist who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films doesn't quite do himself justice here. As his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie I was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film. The only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of Trelkovsky. Some of the supporting cast are great notably Melvyn Douglas as the landlord and Shelley Winters as the concierge but others are weak and miscast. It is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed Parisians have American accents. Quite unexpectedly there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is certainly a good comedic actor. However there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) 'transformation' is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey. All in all The Tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience if a little too languorous for its own good. There's a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film while being very good does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have. Alas at the end of the day an 'okay' Polanski movie is still better than most other 'good' movies. Definitely worth a watch just don't expect to be blown away. ",positive
" I first saw the trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies way back in the day after hearing Stephen King praise it to high heaven. Not really a fan of either star I still wanted to see it because I'm a huge thriller fan. I was not disappointed. The acting was superb especially from the two young boys. Usually I loathe child actors but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too. It was beautifully shot. One must also note the plot twists. The three twists at the end hit hard and fast and I didn't see them coming. The final twist of the film coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed gives me chills to this day even though I've re-watched the film so many times. A true gem. ",positive
" The John Van Druten Broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern-day witch who beguiles a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart may get top billing but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen. The lead pairing is in fact one of the movie's few weaknesses: the gray-haired Stewart seems a bit old for the role and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for Novak it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook. (It is one of the story's amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians.) Curiously the Stewart-Novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in Vertigo released the same year as this film but then Vertigo had a compelling suspense story and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. The film's comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast including a young Jack Lemmon (as Kim's warlock brother) Elsa Lanchester (their ditzy aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!) as a befuddled writer. Hermione Gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of Grand Witch. There's lots to like in this movie--wit romance and a great cast--that is if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting Miss Novak. I have seen the movie a half a dozen times and I never can.

" I didn't mind all the walking. People really did walk places back then. It loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the Martians. I too was disappointed by the effects in particular the Thunderchild scene which I regard as one of the most exciting in the book. But I can't praise this film enough for its faithfulness to Wells's story! It's about time. The actors are likable and the performances are charming. Also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear Jamie Hall's truly great musical score. It was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in London. ",positive
" What is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band. This disc is NOT for the faint of heart...the music is incredibly intense and VERY cool. What you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the Who was so huge for so long. It is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap. In 1969 when this concert was shot the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the Beatles were gone and bands (and audiences) had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity--something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by Britney and Christina. What you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert out it really is amazing. ",positive
" A comedy gem. Lots of laugh out loud moments the shop and pub scenes had me belly- laughing uncontrollably. The characters are recognisable and the dialogue well-observed - I know people like this! The humour is surprisingly gentle and the film (this may sound strange) puts me in mind of an Ealing Comedy. It's a quirky little film with lots of detail. It certainly takes a number of viewings. I've watched it a few times (I've been showing all my friends!) and notice something new each time - a bit of dialogue something visual that I hadn't picked up on before. I could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but I'm not going to because overall this is a great fun feel-good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy. It is a film which will find it's friends and I hope there are a lot of them out there. Oh.... and It has a great soundtrack. ",positive
" I caught this movie on my local movie channel and i rather enjoyed watching the film. It has all the elements of a good teen film and more - this film aside from dealing with boys-girls relationships and sex and the like also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people. The film has that real-life feel to it - no loud music no special effects and no outrageous scenes - which for this movie was right. That feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film - some of which we probably know from where we live. Overall a good movie fun to watch. 8/10 ",positive
" When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death this was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame. His eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears. Both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites. ",positive
" THE TENANTS began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased Bernard Malamud - writer/philosopher - examining the conflicts between Jews and African Americans in the incendiary atmosphere of Brooklyn at the time the book was written. As a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real: as transcribed into a screenplay by novices David Diamond and Danny Green (who also directs) it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments. Harry Lesser (Dylan McDermott) is a Jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his 'newest' book ten years into the writing. Convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started. he is the sole tenant in a condemned Brooklyn tenement owned by Levinspiel (Seymour Cassel) who constantly tries to 'buy out' Harry's lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished. Into this atmosphere enters another Black militant quasi-anti-Semitic writer Willie Spearmint (Snoop Dogg) whom Harry befriends hides and offers help to the nascent novelist's attempt to write about the death of all white people. Harry's attempts to help Willie lead to conflict not the least of which is Harry's meeting Willie's girlfriend the white Jewish Irene Bell (Rose Byrne) at a less than friendly gathering of Willie's militant black brothers and sisters. Willie and Irene are on the skids and Harry gradually falls in love with Irene and they plan to leave New York as soon as Harry finishes his novel. When Willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by Harry Willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers. The ending 'reveals the slippery nature of the human condition and the human capacity for violence and undoing'. The actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters. The cinematography enhances the story keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building. The musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters. Though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings the film in the end is worth watching. At least it attempts to recreate Malamud's bizarre look at life in the big city.

" this movie is a very relaxed romantic-comedy which is thoroughly enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of Albert Einstein though she does believe in her own skills. Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car stuffs up. I loved Walter Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein. This movie just has a very relaxing feel to it while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it (if that is actually possible it happens here). I personally found this movie extremely entertaining especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a cheeky sense of humour this is the movie for you! ",positive
" Excellent. Gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the Western plains with an emphasis on the woman's role and place. A moving film lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences. Low budget independent film; never made any money. Definitely not the romanticized unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life. ",positive
" I don't know much about the Rat Pack and Frank Sinatra always seemed a bit too self-consciously full of himself to me. So when I call this one of my all-time faves it's nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality. As another reviewer says Mad Dog Time is about symbolism not realism. It's kafkaesque (a pity Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd when he was so good as Josef K) it's stylish knowing sardonic and slick. Jeff Goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others don't whom he can outshoot and whom he can't. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball and the supporting cast look spot-on. The symbolism the settings (the one outdoor motion shot with Jeff Goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry) the dialogue (style not practicality is the order of the day) it's all about characters interacting not really gangsterism. Fun to watch must've been fun to do. What the critics were up to is really a mystery... ",positive
" This is absolutely the best none-animated family film I've seen in quite a while back to the first Homeward Bound. Paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot's POV. It's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films up to Disney status IMHO. ",positive
" Thank the Lord for Martin Scorsese and his love of the movies. This is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented American artist working in cinema today and I couldn't recommend it more.

" Welcome to Collingwood offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory. Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past but since we missed the opening credits we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of was the 1958 Italian film Big Deal on Madonna Street directed by Mario Monicelli. The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Macy Luis Guzman Sam Rockwell Patricia Clarkson the late Michael Jeter in it can't be bad. Since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine. The film presents us a group of inane would-be safe crackers from hell. No one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake. Whatever could go wrong and more is what they succeed in doing. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of Cossimo's funeral. The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax and let all these small time crooks do their thing. Let their funny lines make you laugh as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end! ",positive
" I have seen this movie more than several times on TV. I ALWAYS watch it again...NEVER turning the channel. This movie is full of chilling surprises and absolutely edge-of-your-seat suspenseful without being overbearing or stupid. Helen Hunt's talent is magnificently shown in this movie! I recommend this movie to anyone!!! ",positive
" A must see movie for anyone who ever went to camp or wanted to. This film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about. It is funny it is compassionate it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits begin to role. If you have not seen this movie..what are you doing? get off you butt and run the video store. Have a great summer :) ",positive
" I took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making. I always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies especially as I'm such a cynic myself. It's good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who hasn't yet reached the been there done that approach to every movie she sees. I'm pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother / daughter evening out. Far far better than going to see some brain dead chick flick which I gather is what we are supposed to enjoy according to the demographics? Eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of Paris a city I haven't visited in 20 years. But I wish I had. They are loosely linked by joining shots and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world. Some of the films work better than others but as other reviewers have said it never descends too far into kitsch. Some are funny some are sad some intriguing and some just plain puzzling (I'm still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the Flying Tiger Hidden Dragon hairdressing salon.) Some are just fun and perhaps shouldn't be assigned too much meaning (the vampire and the tourist for example.) Possibly my only criticism of the whole film is that it makes Paris look too good. It can also be cold wet foggy indifferent and miserable or in summer baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction. But I'm nit picking. My personal favourite by far was the Coen brothers film shot on the Tuileries Metro station and starring a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers' tiff. Absolutely perfect and very very funny without Buscemi having to say a word. I also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy - that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch but it just stayed on the right side. Rufus Sewell and Emily Mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with Oscar Wilde's tomb left me pretty indifferent and Juliette Binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very very uncomfortable. I thought both the Bob Hoskins / Fanny Ardent piece and Ben Gazzara / Gena Rowlands fell a bit flat but Maggie Gyllenhaal was good (has she cornered the market in junkies? I watched Sherry Baby last week.) But I felt the two social justice pieces (for want of a better way of putting it) worked very well. By that I mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone else's baby across town. And then the film about the African migrant struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young new paramedic. Yet another murder statistic in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life every year. I thought both pieces very well observed. The final film 14th Arrondissement in which Margo Martindale plays a postal worker from Colorado recounting the story of her first trip to Paris  in very badly accented French  to her night school French class moved me. A perfect ending to a good intriguing if not quite great movie. Paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea but it works pretty well. ",positive
" Interesting characters lots of tension. As close to black and white without being black and white. I was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character a quiet near deaf secretary was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get-away. I'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks. In this film we never know who's money it really is they abscond with or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot. Too bad the film could have been great. ",positive
" I think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships (incest and lesbianism) in the romanian society. so... to begin with the second aspect... to make it short it wasn't visible at all... as for the first.. as i said it had much more potential... i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension... much more tension... and the potential tension didn't get through... i think the soundtrack could've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme (wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments)... yeah... i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack.. the actors... i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10... not enough sensuality in the key moments... a total of 7/10.... mostly for the story ",positive
" Don't believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives. Yes it is cheaply made. Yes the gore is laughable. And yes the acting is sub-par. However this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick and if that is your thing (its mine!) then you will enjoy this one. There are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks. For one the score by a then unknown Christopher Young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly. The ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies. And last but not least the setting is what made the film for me. The makers of this film could have done a much better job dressing the set to make it more believable as a college dorm. However if you can overlook this flaw the setting is great. Four collegiates all alone in a huge abandoned condemned building just waiting to be torn down.... it reaks of possibility. When watching allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as I did. ",positive
" Yes this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. The music and dancing is superb. I understand Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse which is quite unique for the time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's great underrated stars. I saw this again on A&E TV and as well have it in my old VCR tapes. Never get tired of these old musicals. Whatever happened to Hollywood?? ",positive
" There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the best. The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system. They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started that's where the moral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle. This film hit's the right note throughout the acting is superb with Stanley Holloway Margaret Rutherford Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat. Well worth a viewing ",positive
" The pre-release version of 1933's Baby Face would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment. Mentored by a Nietszchean professor Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank. Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault the film has no victims except Lily's childhood which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father. The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lily's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate. While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancés to trade jobs for sexual favors. Perhaps the bank failures in the 1930's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women. The plot moves fast and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the façade of the office building as Lily climbs ever higher. Barbara Stanwyck reveled in tough hard-bitten roles and she is in top form here. Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung. Only her African-American confidante Chico receives Lily's affection trust and loyalty. In more enlightened times the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris who plays Chico would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her. Stanwyck often appears overly made-up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris. However despite Stanwyck's tough demeanor obvious tactics and artificial visage she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men including Douglass Dumbrille Donald Cook and a young John Wayne. The preferred version of Baby Face is the 76-minute restored cut. The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts which the longer cut restores and makes explicit. Perhaps Darryl Zanuck who wrote the story under an assumed name intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche whose views on women were controversial. However despite Alphonse Ethier's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life Lily's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor. However the philosophy is but a distraction. Short fast paced and entertaining Baby Face is as contemporary in its morality as Wall Street. Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be greed is good.  ",positive
" David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson...if it already sounds weird to you then you are right because it is. Peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong the value of life etc... He covered these issues in Bladerunner Unforgiven and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines. Paul Anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller. Not surprisingly so have all of his other movies! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications! Peoples' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie. Soldiers trained from birth taught to kill and never had a normal life. They are replaced by better genetically engineered soldiers and Todd one of the original soldiers is left on a planet and left for dead. There he must cope with a group of refugees some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here. BUT THEN... ...The bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. Big violent loud action ensues and Peoples' script turns into an Anderson action-fest. It is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way but the end product is better then I expected. Entertaining somewhat though admittedly not very thought-provoking and exciting once the action starts. 7/10 Rated R: a lot of violence ",positive
" An ultra-modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and deadly) behavior. Or at least that is what Lara Flynn Boyle's character Col Kennedy argues. After a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door Col knows something has got to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect. My opinion: The House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the locations (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress not to mention absolutely stunning. She brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing. Without her it would have failed. It's so alive declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house. Yes it is alive. But the story itself is not so much. Barring Boyle's presence not much is happening here as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. The cinematography lends the film a polished look. 8/10 on account of Boyle the premise of an evil ultra-modern house the locations and cinematography and set decoration and wardrobe. ",positive
" A prison cell.Four prisoners-Carrere a young company director accused of fraud 35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation Daisy a 20 year-old mentally challenged idiot savant and Lassalle a 60 year-old intellectual who murdered his wife.Behind a stone slab in the cell mysteriously pulled loose they discovered a book:the diary of a former prisoner Danvers who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century.The diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape. Malefique is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films I have seen this year.The film has a grimy shadowy feel influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere.There is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well-developed.It's a shame that Eric Valette made truly horrible remake of One Missed Call after his stunning debut.9 out of 10.

" If you like CB4 you have no idea what you're missing if you haven't seen this film yet. This movie is crazy hilarious and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie... It is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody I've ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old-school performers definitley rent this movie. There aren't that many video rental places that have copies of it but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed. ",positive
" The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten all-time favorite movies. It is exciting without gore it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless. The casting couldn't have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in genies. And the epitome of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar very high. ..I watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it. This film is an adventure for all ages..no-one too old to enjoy it. The Thief of Bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time...I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the U.S. was just about to enter WWII. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying evilness a few years later in Casablanca. And Korda teamed up I believe with Justin and Dupree again in The Four Feathers ....great film-making! ",positive
" Paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up. Tony Shaloub executes a flawless performance as an Russian Scientist (PhD) who cannot find decent work in America. He befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science lab. The chief Doctor is a bitter man as Paulie who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn embarasses the Doctor who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building where Mikail (Tony S.) finds him. Paulie recants his life with Marie and how they lost each other. The quest begins to reunite Paulie with Marie only more than 20 years has passed. The movie ends some will say predictably with Mikail reuniting Paulie with Marie. The story closes with the three entering Marie's home where you can make the final your own choice. Great family film! ",positive
" Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hopper's creepy violent character and JT Walsh's sneakiness. A drifter gets mistaken for a hit-man and tries to make a little dough out of it but gets in over his head. I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when Cage walks into a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling work with the help of his buddy...and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain when the character does the same thing! But that's another story. Dennis Hopper is at his best here...cocky one-step-ahead villainous seething and explosively violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as the man with a dark past trying to live legitimately (well almost). There are only 4 real characters of note here with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of Red Rock Wyoming. The first twist hits early on and from there it's a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town. Satisfying. 8 pts. ",positive
" Well I had seen They all laughed when it came out in Europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it. I 've just seen it again on tape almost twenty years after... Bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also. Excellent comedians and actors good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing too. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just as we all do at times. Go get it. ",positive
" Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense. Based on the book Evil Angels and titled so in its Australian release A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke her mind someone who didn't play the sympathy card and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child. The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece. And through it all Lindy remained as stoic as ever even when her husband Michael was falling apart. This stance of course is the power of strength as unsympathetic as it may look like and people happen to react strongly to that. They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn not sit there and look blank. People don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold but not unfeeling woman one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty. Because of her Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to or the Chamberlains would be too detached and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media. They'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public. ",positive
" I've read a number of reviews on this film and I have to say What is wrong with you people?!?! This was an excellent film! I thought this film was superb from start to finish and the story was extremely well told. I'm convinced that the people that didn't like this film weren't paying very good attention to the film. There are a number of very important scenes that if you aren't paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. I urge anyone who didn't like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so that you can truly pay attention. The story made perfect sense to me and as I said was very well told. Every scene in the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the film. All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was superb as Tanny Brown playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was a nice touch as well and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise I didn't really expect anything great from him but he pulled off a great performance. Ed Harris was the real gem in the film. He plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is. Watch his eyes in his scenes just superb!!! Also there is a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of her first roles...not a bad place to start. Excellent cast in this film! I would strongly recommend this film to anyone that likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers. This is a great film and should be seen. Don't listen all these other people's opinions go see the movie and come to your own conclusions. I hope that you will see the film and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading -Chris ",positive
" As soon as I knew Keira Knighteley being in this flick I said I have to watch this movie . She's the undisputed main character Domino a bounty hunter. Her job as the no action scenes would teach us reflects her rebel violent attitude to life. I have to admit that it's the very first time that I watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands. So this stomped me a bit. Anyway for all the John Woo's fans there are helicopters falling down explosions gunfire as if it would rain and a lovely Keira that shoots with two machine guns one per hand. The cast is absolutely brilliant. Going beyond Keira which in this movie is a real tomboy pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see Mickey Rourke is back with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body. Christopher Walken makes his job pretty well as a reality show producer. Let's go to the contents: this movie has a journalistic shape. The talk show scene is disgustingly real. Anyone that watched that load of . . . you-know-what can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations. As well as the producer when Domino's mom says that the reality that should show Domino's life is trash; no offense he answers I don't take it like an offense . This movie portrays a difficult life. Domino coming from a world that didn't want her Ed (Mickey Rourke) a bounty hunter not so bounty Choco (the third guy of the band) which family is (using Ed's words) the correctional institutes he's been and Alf the driver/bomber coming from Afghanistan during the Russian occupation. This bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born without the shirt ; unlucky violent and with nothing to lose excepts their (as they would consider) miserable lives. The intro of the movie says that it is inspired by true story . . . more or less so I couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true. Anyway going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons (which could have been added to make the film easier to see and be classified as an action movie) the characters' story is too realistic to be edulcorated . The interaction between the characters is various well studied and definitely not boring. What hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist (Lucy Liu sober as never in her acting career). It represents only the reason by which Domino starts telling her story (and that's a story). Probably the only con in a movie with a lot of pros . All in all: This isn't SWAT . The characters are crafted; they have an identity a shape. They have a name and a surname (not just Gamble and Street ). It's the case to say it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet. ",positive
" Thankfully as a student I have been able to watch Diagnosis Murder for a number of years now. It is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing. The main cast gave good performances and Dick Van Dyke's entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic dance and humor. The best aspects of DM was the fast pace witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score. Sadly it has been unfairly compared to Murder She Wrote . DM is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now it is gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of feelgood family friendly cop shows. Now there is just depressing 'gritty' ones. ",positive
" The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions bad puns and gunfire and to be fair there is a lot of that in it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films. But give it 18 years and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action film it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different to the Stephen King book true but I doubt whether Hollywood with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando would have accepted it in its current form. But on with the review. Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. The economy is in tatters food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch like Jumping for Dollars where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs and the most popular one is The Running Man a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'. Some however try and speak up against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield California a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labour camp but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the run. However his freedom does not last long and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him he finds himself taken prisoner again but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man. And there of course the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers' along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence and discovers he was framed. Guess what happens to her then? So as Amber Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. He's Super Arnie the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent. Yes the remainder of the film becomes dumb loud classic 80's Arnie fun. There's a lot of exciting fight sequences the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite) and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way as well and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings. If you expect a high-brow intelligent film you'll be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick well this is it. But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic. If you look at the entertainment we have today you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV. We've already had that however with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets. With that in mind and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. Of course we haven't reached there yet as it's terrorists rather than the mainstream media who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...

" Anthony McGarten has adapted his play Via Satellite and directed the best comedic film to come out of New Zealand for a long time. Chrissy Dunn (Danielle Cormack) is a drop-out. She hasn't achieved much in her latter years and has grown resentful of her family since her father's deathbed confession. Her twin sister Carol (also portrayed by Danielle Cormack) is basking in the media limelight as she represents New Zealand in swimming at the Olympics. A middle-aged desireless and desperate director (Brian Sergent) and his good-natured cameraman - who is also Chrissy's one-night stand from the night previous - Paul (Karl Urban) film the Dunn family's proudest moment; watching Carol swim to victory. This wouldn't be so bad but Chrissy's family is the epitome of embarrassing. First of all there is the matriach of the Wellingtonian Dunns Joyce (Donna Akerston). She makes fairy cakes and cocktail sausages for the all-important film crew and refuses to change the way she is. Her oldest daughter Jen (Rima Te Wiata) is desperate to be something more than common. She has a nice home (with bedroom walls painted Blackberry sorbet ) expensive tastes and a nasty parasitic attitude to match. She is also nearing 40 and desparate for a child. Her husband Ken (Tim Balme) is an electrician and forces himself on jobs that don't need doing...as well as doing jobs that need to be done ie Jen. The middle daughter Lyn (Jodie Dorday - who won Best Supporting Actress at New Zealand Film Awards for this portrayal)is a knocked-up tart who has a dubious history with Ken. Both older sisters clash the mother is in a state Ken is as bad a ToolTime Tim Taylor Carol is fuelling her Olympic desire and Chrissy is aware all of this is to be splashed on national tv - why shouldn't she be embarrassed? It is great to see some famous New Zealand faces perform in the suburban comedy that has witty lines to spare. I loved the sparring between Jen and Lyn. One is like an adult Mona-my-biological-clock-is-ticking-away the other a narcisstic tramp who has what her sister desires - a bun in the oven. Climax of the film is quite sentimental and is nicely done. The performances are a treat and the film works perfectly. A great way to spend an hour-and-a-half. ",positive
" ''Ranma ½ is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story that is not only a comedy but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers who are great friends and trained together during many years. Akane is the younger and most violent sister of the Tendo's: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what. Ranma and Akane fight all the time specially because both have a very bad temper and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda many new characters and situations starts to happen. They also discover the reason of the transformation: while fighting Ranma and his father fell in a cursed river. But not only them had this kind of fate... If you watched ''Ranma 1/2'' and liked I would recommend you ''Inuyasha'' and ''Maison Ikkoku two other good creations from Rumiko's hands. ",positive
" Like Ishtar and King of Comedy other great misunderstood comedies Envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers (may be too harsh a word I will call them suburban under-achievers). This film was a dark comedy gem and I'm not sure what people expect. I relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn't filled with obvious humor and I believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile. The look on Stiller's face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. Yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (the J-Man's decrepit cabin by the lake Corky's unceremonious burial Weitz's wife role and Walken's J-Man -- all great stuff. I can't stand people that get on IMDb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one. I will take Envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year (save Napoleon Dynamite.) It's wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gem. Remember this people; Most times Popular doesn't equal Good. ",positive
" Pearl S.Buck was a brilliant author that was a first American lady won Nobel prize in literature in 1938 and received her prize with Enrico Fermi an Italian Physit. She wrote this romance in 1931 which was a second one after her first novel (East wind and West wind) in 1930 and her beginning in literature was fantastic upon her premier novels. she won in 1935 (Pulitzer prize) in literature on her eternal novel (The good earth) which made a brilliant panorama on the life of Chinese peasant (Wung Lung) and his wife (O-Lane) and their efforts to face the hardness of hard positions in their earth to reach for their big fortune by their shoulders. Paul Muni succeeded in this role as Chinese peasant that he prepared himself in this role upon his sittings with Chinese people in San Francisco in their town to be Chinese exactly as a real and true. Shara Reiner succeeded in her role as (O-Lane) by this brilliant evidence that she won An Academy Awarded as a best actress in 1937. ",positive
" In the hands of lesser actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan this film could have become silly and trite. But with these two experienced thespians leading the way I found Silent Fury to be a most exciting and pleasurable little mystery. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he was best man at that wedding one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work. As Colbert Ryan and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed. Although it's not very difficult to figure out just who the main baddie is it's still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story increases. All in all a good solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated Paul Kelly. ",positive
" Two years ago I watched The Matador in cinema and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously I was totally under impression of Pierce Brosan's magnificent role. Yesterday I caught this movie again on TV so I looked at it a bit deeper. Now I can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man. Brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of Julian Noble tired hit-man who has no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City man who's got bad luck: his son died in accident his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis). I always liked movies like this; crime movie with big touch of humor. Mostly that humor comes from Brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d.... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning after the navy's left town. Brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually. I also like Greg 'typical American face' Kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like Danny Wright. So I recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of Brosnan ever. He'll make you smile and admire him at the same time. Great Brosnan in not equally great movie. ",positive
" Coming from the same director who'd done Candyman and Immortal Beloved I'm not surprised it's a good film. Ironically Papierhaus is a movie I'd never heard of until now yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s - partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades. (Not talking about Iranian or Swedish cinema here...) The acting is not brilliant but merely solid - unlike what some people here claim (they must have dreamt this wondrous acting much like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly. These unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose leaving it up to the individual's interpretation and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this. Pepperhaus is a somewhat unusual mix of kids' film and horror with effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie-cliché ultra-shy-but-secretly-brilliant social-outcast girl but a regular normal kid; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit-like childhoods into their books and onto the screens as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly lonely childhood as if that's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy snogging (for quite a stretch) was a bit much - evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement - considering that she was supposed to be only 11 but predictably it turned out that Burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed. I have no idea why they didn't upgrade the character's age or get a younger actress. It was quite obvious that Burke isn't that young. Why directors always cast kids older than what they play hence dilute the realism I'll never know. ",positive
" Demonicus is a movie turned into a video game! I just love the story and the things that goes on in the film.It is a B-film ofcourse but that doesn`t bother one bit because its made just right and the music was rad! Horror and sword fight freaks buy this movie now! ",positive
" Two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets; a slimy South American drug-lord and a prominent general. Moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere Sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller taking it's time establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences. Director Llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; some detours here don't add up to much. But this film is far better than his Stallone/Stone travesty The Specialist. Billy Zane usually incredibly tiresome does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget Hollywood venture. He can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here reprising the role twice more in direct to DVD sequels. ",positive
" (No spoilers just plot details) I can't understand such hatred for this episode. You want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Watch Subterranean - now there's a sack of crap. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I don't say that very often) and Michael Rosenbaum is great but he is most of the time. The alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic. The Martian Manhunter who previously appeared in Static returns and tells Clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if Clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him. An overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace. ",positive
" Sequel to The Kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw. Ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies voodoo...this has it all! If you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you. Also you don't have to see Part 1 to understand this...you'll figure it out! Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring. Sadly there probably won't be a Kingdom 3 --Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after this was filmed. But you never know! ",positive
" It appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams it's often foolish and illogical. It's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our angel. Jeanette's deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog for some strange reason) then Aloha Oe on the beach! It's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove. ",positive
" I watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue. And when I watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh. I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film. However watching it now I can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was. But i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on VHS on my fist TV that would cloud the image in yellow. And and bearing in mind it is a children's film that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10. ",positive

" Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special. If you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin cribbed from the film. They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers. I've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten which is where a good portion of this film dwells because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing. Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end. From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting. It doesn't kill the film but it does weaken it. Still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie. ",positive
" -The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her. Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog. This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds a giant spider that's really hungry and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen. -This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses genies flying carpets and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs. It doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time. The production designs are just stunning in this movie. From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter. Even though this movie is over 40 years old the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema. The music and songs are also well done. Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies. I'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie. -What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like Two Towers and Silent Hill . Way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place. One of my favorite shots in Two Towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor and that's what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie. They're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings. -It's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of Aladdin got their inspiration. The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet. It's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that I'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie. I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it's amazing. That's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time. Sure the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break. Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard. -If you ever wanted to see a live action version of Aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea.

" It's nothing brilliant groundbreaking or innovative but 'Dog Days' is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study. It's like CRASH tripping on a bad dose of heroin but not really. It's an Austrian film following the lives of several depressed deranged and annoying people and their abusive relationships with each other. It's disturbing yet very well-acted and it's interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do. Certainly not for the weak-hearted this highly pessimistic film offers no conclusion or revelation at the end we just see the lives of these sordid individuals over the course of two days. Grade: B ",positive
" Sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands (Wayne's World the first one not the second). But most often they have duds (It's Pat comes to mind rather quickly). This time out it's Tim Meadows as The Ladies Man. This movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud. It was very funny for the first 20 minutes but then as usually happens with SNL skits it starts to slow down before finally ending long after it should have. Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps a radio DJ with a nightly show called The Ladies Man. He answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships usually in the crudest way possible. Everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt. After pushing the buttons of the station manager Leon along with his producer Julie (Karyn Parsons) gets fired and needs to find another job. Out of the random blue comes a letter from one of his ex-ladies. The letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life the only problem being that the letter isn't signed. So Leon needs to track down all the women he's been with to find the woman of his dreams. But sometimes as Billy Dee Williams says in the film the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you. There is also a sub-plot about a bunch of guys who's wives/girlfriends have all slept with Leon and they want to first figure out who he is (by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy) then kill him. Leading this bunch of guys is surprise! Will Ferrell from SNL. First off I thought the sub-plot was rather lame. The singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless. I usually like Will Ferrell but here he just never clicked for me. And the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along and in the end all decided that having their wives/girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault. So back to the main story. The story basically centers around Leon and sex. So what it comes down to is if you don't like the character of Leon you won't like the movie. His voice his mannerisms his dialogue is what carries the movie. I am not a big fan of Tim Meadows. I never thought he was a particularly good actor on SNL. The only thing I ever really liked of his was his Ladies Man skits. But the best thing about those is that they usually involved the guest host (remember the one with Cameron Diaz?) and they were short. For about 5 minutes they were pretty funny. And here for about 20 minutes it's really funny. What I thought was good about the character in the movie is that he stayed in character throughout. He never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona. Until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up. Other than that it was pretty good at keeping Leon as Leon and not changing him into something less crude than he was. There isn't a lot of substance to this movie if you couldn't guess. But like I said earlier the beginning of the movie I found to be very funny. Some real laugh out loud moments all revolving around sex and his crudeness. The problem of course with this movie and most other SNL spin offs is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time. Stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult. That difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub-plot because without it this movie would have been a little under an hour. When it was good it was good but when it wasn't good it got to be boring. So overall The Ladies Man wasn't as bad as other SNL films but it wasn't as good as others. It had some funny moments the first 20 minutes was pretty good but the rest of it dragged on. There was an unnecessary sub-plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film. The bottom line is if you like Tim Meadows and his Leon Phelps character you'll be able to watch the film. If he annoys you don't even bother going. Unless you just want to see Tiffani Theissen in some nice revealing clothing. ",positive
" This is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here. This is still the best Action movie ever done. The action movies of today are badly done The actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly. only some no how to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever. The start where Chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing. The end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film. The end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass Jackie was badly hurt. ",positive
" I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood/bollywood film and I am glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married.

" Jackie Chan's classic directorial feature POLICE STORY (1985) is among the most influential and over-the-top modern day police actioners ever to come out from Hong Kong. Jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other urban action which would later become very popular and typical among HK directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam. POLICE STORY mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds. Jackie plays Chan Ka-Kui a police who gets to protect an important witness (Brigitte Lin) who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity. Jackie's girlfriend is played by young and sweet Maggie Cheung who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like Heroic Trio (and the sequel) by Johnnie To Savior of the Soul by Corey Yuen and David Lai and many many others. The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place. Jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which Jackie hits his head (near the eye) through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass. Also Jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film. The scene in which a bus stops right before Jackie spitting the kidnappers through the windshield went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to. They were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries. During the end credits there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely. The action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by (action) director Chan. The now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver. Jackie always tells how important editing is (which is true) and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to Hollywood efforts for instance. There's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch. But there is again one negative point which I cannot stand in HK action comedies which is this comedy itself. The comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue. I mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare and he is there to murder that girl. This kind of acting is stupid and inept and I wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre. Characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those loud thoughts are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and light. Even if the film is comic and not so serious these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily. POLICE STORY is a fast speed full impact balls to the walls action adventure miracle from Hong Kong and from the time when Jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the US produced The Protector as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director James Glickenhaus had and thus the result didn't please audiences and Jackie and he returned to Hong Kong to make more personal and inventive film. That he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80's. This is among the most insane action films ever and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws I mentioned. 7/10 ",positive
" First off let's start with the negative points: 1) There are HUGE gaping wholes in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered; 2) The movie is not for all people so impolite viewers will get restless and start yapping during the movie. Point two above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older type theater (like the one I went to) you can hear the reel going through the projector at times. I loved that. The movie does not keep you busy with music nor effects: it lets you reflect upon what is happening. There is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. I would highly recommend it to fans of cinema as the cinematographic work is amazing. Those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed. It's the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards. (My version of it is pretty darn cool but probably quite off-track!) If you do go catch the movie there is one very cool part: when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hats off to the person that thought of doing this. ",positive
" I recently watched this but when it started I had no idea what the concept was about what the topic was.....in short - I had no idea what it was. Was it a documentary was it a comedy routine.....Well it was BOTH. It started a little slow but I think that's because I had absolutely no idea what type of program I was viewing. But it quickly sucked me in. The episode I watched had Robert Wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history. Mainly how we (american's) learn history that isn't really true - and how we got to learn what we did. He did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained and interested. I actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be. I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO. I believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are taught in the same type of manner as this episode. ",positive
" Brokedown Palace is truly a one of a kind. It's an amazing story showing two girl's plight for freedom against the Thailand justice system. They soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about. Alice Morano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale) are two best friends strait out of high school. They suddenly change their vacation plans from Hawaii to Thailand and are immediately captivated by a young man Nick Parks. He flirts with them both and suggests that the three of them go to Hong Kong for the weekend. When the two arrive at the airport they are immediately searched for drugs. Someone tipped off customs and in an instant their life is changed forever. In the mix of the confusion of settling into their new life they learn about a highly respected lawyer named Hank Green (Bill Pullman). An American who knows the Thai justice system he fights for the girl to be free. But they soon find out when they leave or go is all up to them. If you're looking for a great movie that'll stay with you for years - Brokedown Palace is definitely the way to go. ",positive
" Yes some people have said that this movie was a waste of money but i'm the kind of die hard dragon/world-ending/holy crap action movie fan. But if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action sences were pretty dang good. But its that kind of movie that everything just fell tougher at the right time or just about when evil was trumph something fell in to save them at the right time. Though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised me. The 3d graphics were pretty damn good. I mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were GREAT!!!! Big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had. The fight between good and evil at the end was I have to to say could have been longer and slightly better it was still pretty good. Now on to the parts that i think could have been better. The beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles. I mean if you don't really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a DVDer... overall i loved the movie but the plot just fell into place to fast and fit tougher just to well.

" It'd be easy to call Guys and Dolls great. It's got Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando (and contrary to Sinatra's original wishes the casting works) it's got a really cool 1950s feel even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption. And most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself. If it's not entirely as great as some others of its ilk it shouldn't be any fault of the filmmaker Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog feels like it's being performed for the stage as opposed to film (it's hard to tell at times- Brando and Sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the stage while the actress playing Adele is better for stage than screen). The plot is one of those winners that works well for its period even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999's She's All That (well not quite but close). A gambler (and 14-year betrothed) played by Sinatra wants to host a big-time game but is told that the heat is on meaning the cops are on watch. So he has only one choice to host the game with a thousand dollar tab. The only way he can get it is through a big-time bet with fellow gambler Brando who's put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker. It allows for the predictable twists in the story in the sudden turn-on-turn-off of the charms of the character of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets (gangsters and dancers and the saitn played by Jean Simmons who falls for Brando). It is in its basic concept about this whole world of guys and dolls and how to balance one or the other- obviously without getting married or too compromised. Mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece even when keeping still with the camera on the subject and his stars are properly reeled in. Hell even Brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply THE method actor and shows his chops for singing and big-star quality. The story and characters eventually wind down to what you'd hope will happen and that's fine. All we ask for- and what we get- is entertainment in good spurts of witty involving dialog and a few songs and dances that bring the house down (my favorites were the number with the lady-cats at the club Luck be a Lady and the two numbers down in Havana Cuba).

" In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey so I nearly skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in Ghost Train -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. One can feel moreover the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. As for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen the more likely you'll guess at the ending but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance.

" First things first Edison Chen did a fantastic believable job as a Cambodian hit-man born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive living on the mantra of kill or be killed. In a role that had little dialogue or at least a few lines in Cambodian/Thai his performance is compelling probably what should have been in the Jet Li vehicle Danny the Dog where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting and on someone else's leash. Like Danny the Dog the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically but rather designed as normal brutal fisticuffs where everything goes. This probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other's throats in defending their own lives while taking it away from others. It's a grim gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production. Edison plays a hired gun from Cambodia who becomes a fugitive in Hong Kong on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry. Leading the chase is the team led by Cheung Siu-Fai who has to contend with maverick member Inspector Ti (Sam Lee) who's inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father. So begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of Hong Kong. The story itself works on multiple levels especially in the character studies of the hit-man and the cop. On opposite sides of the law we see within each character not the black and white but the shades of grey. With the hit-man we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl (Pei Pei) bringing about a sense of maturity tenderness and revealing a heart of gold. The cop with questionable tactics and attitudes makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. There are many interesting moments of moral questioning on how anti-hero despicable strategies are adopted. You'll ask what makes a man and what makes a beast and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark inner streak in all of us transforming from man to dog and dog to man? Dog Bite Dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag especially on its tender moments and it suffered too from not knowing when to end. If I should pick a favourite scene then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered a suspenseful edge of your seat moment. Listen out for the musical score too and you're not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs. Highly recommended especially if you think that you've seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre. ",positive
" It's a short movie from David Lynch with just 8 minutes but it got all the Lynchian ingredients ! It's mysterious dark inconclusive eerie and strange; and before the blond girl starts to talk it's even a bit scary! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it's also sinister and mysterious About the setting itself it hasn't the traditional red curtains but it has socking purple painted walls which give it an equally effect of eeriness. The plot is about a girl who's locked in a dark room and she cries for help; then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way saying she's there just because of her fault We don't know what did happen or what will happen next it ended unsolved and puzzling as a good Lynch movie must end! It's a great short despite some amateurish acting. The girls are professional actresses but I think their acting could have been better in this short. ",positive
" Overall I would have to say that I liked the movie. Some of the fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. Otherwise Sammo copies Bruce Lee's fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars. ",positive
" Ronald Colman gives an electrifying performance as Tony John a Broadway actor who can't separate his offstage life from Shakespeare's Othello the character he plays on stage....Two important scenes illustrate Tony's dilemma. The first one takes place in producer Max Lasker's office. Acting is a matter of talent for the practical-minded Lasker. But Donlan Tony's friend disagrees: No no. When you do it like Tony does it it's much more. The way he has of becoming someone else every night...so completely. No don't tell me his whole system isn't affected by it. ....The other scene occurs in waitress Pat Kroll's apartment. Tony tells her his name is Martin. She thanks him. Then he says: Or Paul. Hamlet. Joe. And maybe Othello. ....When Tony begins rehearsing Othello we learn that though he's trying to keep his real life separated from his stage life The part begins to seep into your life and the battle begins. Reality against imagination. He can't keep the two separated: In his mind Pat is Desdemona and he's Othello and he wrongly believes she has been unfaithful to him. He murders her....Colman's bravura performance in a complex and difficult role earned him 1947's Academy Award for Best Actor. Oscar nominations went to Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for Best Original Screenplay. Not to be overlooked is Milton Krasner's atomspheric cinematography. ",positive
" The makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.The horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors playing parts.I have never gotten so immersed in a film as I have this one.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on screen as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty Ronny Cox Bill McKinney and though he appeared only briefly James Dickey the man who authored the book upon which the film is based as the sheriff of Aintry.It is somewhat disturbing and kids of course should be shielded from it but this is great dramatic cinema.

" I was pleased with the cast of reputable players. The story is one of standing up for a cause even if you are at personal risk in doing so. In a time where violence and pain are often in the movie forefront this movie focuses on the old fashioned good cop. Although similar plots have been done repeatedly these guys pull it off well. Kick back and enjoy. Dennehy is a master of taking over a movie. ",positive

" Loved the movie. Loved the two families crossing paths in history. Only question is if Sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue? He is Madame Zeroni's son and Zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. Just loved it. The acting was great. Not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier. The other counseler did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much. Poor Warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up. ",positive
" The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Really this episode is the exact same content as the DVD pilot release. That having been said episode 01 gives a very substantive background of the very popular Battlestar Galactica series (both the original and the 2007 remake). It significantly applies most to the 2007 series. As is the trending plots of sci-fi of late this series explores Virtual life or environment. On top of this we are given much background on the Adama family line as well as their relationship with the unrevealed (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cylons. To the most part this first episode revolves around the popular topic of Virtual life and (as is expected) early life of the colonies and the birth of the Cylons. Over all I rather enjoyed this episode. Although it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the DVD release of the Caprica pilot the series seems very promising. As is the case with many pilots episode 01 leaves us with a cliff-hanger so to ensure a follow by an audience (sci-fi community). I'm definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development. I give this series 8 stars. ",positive
" As others have mentioned all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous. The plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around they want to be pursued but when no men are around they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love. ",positive
" A wonderful free flowing often lyrical film that whisks you along ever smiling even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way. One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well. This is possibly Depardieu's best performance certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age. Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play. Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant/romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect. ",positive
" Im not a big Tim Matheson fan but i have to admit i liked this film.It was dark and a small bit disturbing with some scenes a bit edgy i don't know were to classify this film its a bit SF and a bit horror slash thriller.I saw this at about 2.00am or so on my local channel there was nothing else on so i decided to watch it.If you have not seen this film id recommend it its not really that bad the characters are interesting enough but not really explored to their full potential which could have made this film even more better.I don t know if this film went to the cinema but it felt like it was made for TV or went straight to video i for one would buy this if it s on DVD it fits well with my type of film and has a small bit of the X-FILES story attached to it.Government undertakings or shifty corporations involved in dodgy shadowy dealings.Overall a good film.

" My grandmother bought me this film when I was 5 (I've always love scary movies) and even then I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is awesome and the story original and entertaining. I especially love the scenes where the RV is under attack in the desert. The rocks are actually convincing for such a low-budget flick. The acting is above average for these kinds of films and the music is eerie. This is definitely an uder-rated gem. I recommend it to anyone who likes these strange films from the late seventies early eighties such as Alice Sweet Alice Poor Pretty Eddie Nightmare Hospital Massacre and Return of the Aliens the Deadly Spawn . Definitely a classic!! ",positive
" This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has very good acting by Hanks Newman and everyone else. Definitely Jude Law's best performance. The cinematography is excellent the editing is about as good and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie. The production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special. To me it takes a lot to beat Godfather but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest. Definitely a Best Picture nominee in my book. ",positive
" Not a bad film. Somehow I was made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan. The ending on the bus was exhilarating. The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law some women try to sneak in but many of them get caught and detained. It's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender. In an interview Panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how Iran once lived. One hopes that future will come sooner rather than later. ",positive
" I saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list. It is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits (such as the 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair) that people aren't seeing because YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE HISPANIC. This is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular. Please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon. I completely see what the writer/director was going for and he hit the target perfectly! This film is highly deserving of a better rating. ",positive
" This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful The Legend of Boggy Creek is a follow-up in name only. Stories abound in a sleepy self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called Big Bay Ty that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older more sensible tomboy sister (a sweetly feisty performance by cute pigtailed future Different Strokes sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry bear-like humongous but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue. Tom Moore's casual no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic restrained unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on Gilligan's Island ) gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids' loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethard's capable sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor. Darrell Deck's score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. In addition this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90's kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance. ",positive
" After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century Australian street we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they go out house hunting. They manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh Sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home. It just may be haunted. 13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker. The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening thriller scene features some wonky editing. Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action. Suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques. There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity. The tracking and the cuts need to be slow. The attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked. As it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that. After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves. The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror (1979) though the budget forces a much subtler approach. Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall. For some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama. At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in. But Morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue. The material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house. Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good. The performances help create tension. There isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares. But neither menace is really the point. The point is human relationships. There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it. That it's in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems. Peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be. Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship. Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness as a TV movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions. Anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. It certainly isn't worth spending $30 for a DVD (that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)) but it's worth a rental and it's definitely worth watching for free.

" This 1998 film was based on a script by the late Edward D. Wood a script that featured NO dialogue in the tradition of films such as THE THIEF. While much of Wood's work was quirky low-budget entries into various genre-film traditions his first released feature GLEN OR GLENDA was a truly visionary attempt to express the inexpressible through primitive avant-garde techniques. I WOKE UP EARLY THE DAY I DIED represents THAT side of Ed Wood the experimenter although this film is a comedy (a nightmarish comedy however!) while the cross-dressing theme of GLEN OR GLENDA was taken so seriously by Wood that there was not room for comedy there. From the first few seconds of this film I knew that I was being taken to a new cinematic world and I can't really compare that world with anything else. The technical side of the film--production design sound design music scoring photography etc.--is groundbreaking on any number of levels. In particular although the film has no dialogue there is sound of all kinds and also language but you'll have to see how it's done yourself as the cleverness and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout. The Glen or Glenda-esque technique of juxtaposing stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum. The whole film is played at a hysterical fever-pitch and Billy Zane provides an amazing tour-de-force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is. In a just world he would have been given some award for this performance. He even LOOKS like Ed Wood and as played by Zane this character is at various timesfunny sleazy tragic sympathetic and anonymous(sometimes simultaneously!!!). What a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a North American theatrical or video release only playing a few festivals. Right now it's only available on video in Germany (in fact my copy is from a German source--the excerpts from Wood's screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german although the newspaper headlines (that great low-budget technique of giving plot elements especially those that would be too expensive to film via newspaper headlines is used here in the Wood tradition)that Zane sees are in English). I think that this film could have gotten a word-of-mouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion. And if played off city by city slowing on the art-film circuit it could have done well. In fact if the legal issues can be resolved I'd like to suggest that the film should STILL be given a theatrical release especially a MIDNIGHT cult release. This is a classic waiting to be discovered. Did I understand every scene? No but I felt every scene emotionally. Did everything work in the film? Perhaps not. I've only seen it twice and the first time I saw it I was interruped a number of times. However with all the assembly-line junk playing the multiplexes and with so much alternative film being fetishistic or pretentious shot-on-video film-school rejects we need actual Hollywood-made experimentation like this. The recent Bob Dylan film Masked and Anonymous took similar chances as did something like Steven Soderbergh's FULL FRONTAL. This film could find an audience much larger than either of those. If you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing see if it has ever been released on video. You will NOT be bored. Invite some friends over...make it a party. Play the amazing soundtrack LOUD. I have a feeling that wherever he is in the afterlife Ed Wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and validated somewhat by the making of this film. Wood's probably also laughing that just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in lawsuits and sits unreleased in the country of its making.

" This is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990's versions but is still not all that good. It feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other BBC 1980's period pieces such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90's versions and St John Rivers is at least covered although not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester but the actress playing Jane is much too old. There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it. ",positive
" ELEPHANT WALK may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasi-melodramatic mode. It is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny. A previous reviewer John Mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called Elephant Walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late Tom Wiley right across the elephants' traditional path to the major source of water the river. To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film: the hubris of man. That his son played by Peter Finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy 'boys' club' as his role models. The point of the father was that he was a self-made man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water. Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water? This is the nexus of the film: what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love? Ceylon today's Sri Lanka is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of Miss Taylor. Were it not for this exotic location (much of the film was shot in Ceylon) and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler. One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant 'conquerors' that were part and parcel of the British raj. It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble. Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees (grille work window and doorway borders) evidently specified by art directors J. McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island. Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought. For those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of Miss Taylor as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased. As I said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today. This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive-in not on the home TV so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera-work and scope.

" OK it's not a perfect movie by any means but I disagree with the overall IMDb opinion that it's really really bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era dearly. I never saw 'Black Mask' at the time and only saw it last week for the first time. Apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my DVD copy didn't give me the option to turn off the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated Hong Kong movies during this time. I still stick to my guns in the opinion that when it comes to action these guys no matter what their budget add an element of magic to the screen no Bourne Supremacy Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I'm not knocking these movies - I just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated) will ever achieve. What is it? It's the feeling that the film-makers were experimenting as they shot and edited not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time. For me this makes watching movies all the more fun and dangerous. ",positive
" I did not see this film in the theater. I confess to an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was John Travolta to be making movies? I remember the Oscar broadcast that year with Travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn't win. How dare he when there were real actors in the running? I'm sorry John you should have won. After catching this film on cable years ago I fell in love with the entire movie. Bud Sissy Uncle Bob Wes all wonderfully done. I also confess to never passing it by when I channel surf. I HAVE to stop and watch. Over the years I've learned to do most of the dialogue dance with my thumbs in my waistband and learned to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointing thing to me was the oversight on the soundtrack of some of the music from Urban Cowboy. Looking for love defines the film but Urban Cowboy was chock full of classics that DIDN'T make it to the soundtrack. It should have been a double CD........ ",positive
" I watched this movie expecting what I got: good sci-fi cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role. Imagine trying to act under these two restraints: you have hardly any dialogue and because you are playing a hardass military robot you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped. In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed Russell pulls off an incredible characterization. His robot becomes human in spite of the constraints. Great job! As usual Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered. Connie Nielsen was sweet soft motherly and gorgeous. I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty but it was hard to take one's eyes off her. Unfortunately Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. Much of the plot is quite standard with a fair amount of weaknesses but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling I don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. By the end of the story the good guy wins and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. Yes! The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point. ",positive

" I voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I have been able to see in quite some time. The animation is stunning. The artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful. From the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry. I was amazed. Moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh. Character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand. I'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family. ",positive
" I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 and feel I have to jump in here. I understand he doesn't like the film but his reasons are not evident. My feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness failure disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two people as portrayed have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other. Only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire sentimental and sappy. I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances. I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her Vietnam era actions but personal feelings apart she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first I have seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it. This film was a big surprise when I first viewed it and I look forward to seeing it again. ",positive
" Linking story: another first-time viewing for me and again this is one of the most popular of the Amicus anthologies - and it's easy to see why though I realize how the film's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some; I certainly fancied director Peter Duffell's choice - DEATH AND THE MAIDEN (which incidentally is a classical piece by Schubert that is heard in the film during the Peter Cushing episode) - a great deal more. Though the linking device itself is not all that great the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable. Production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget Duffell had to work with. The latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and frankly it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre (though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him). Now to the individual stories themselves: Method For Murder : the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but to make up for this it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times (Tom Adams' 'fictitious' villain looking like the long-lost brother of Boris Karloff from THE OLD DARK HOUSE [1932]); also it ends with a satisfactory DIABOLIQUE-type twist and features a fairly intense role for Denholm Elliott in the lead. That's all we need out of it really. Waxworks : for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland are both excellent (as well as impeccably dressed) in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death; an ominous hallucination scene with Peter Cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand and Ackland's inexplicable inability - or unwillingness - to leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats of Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962). Sweets To The Sweet : this is perhaps the finest episode of all - with his ambiguous role here Christopher Lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding Nyree Dawn Porter and the deceptive innocence of Chloe Franks (who appears as Lee's daughter). The film's treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain'. Trivia Note: Chloe Franks appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc and when I saw her I felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldn't quite put my finger on it. Later on reading her filmography it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap in London's West End which my brother and I were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the Summer of 2002! Needless to say we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrayal in sheer evil mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile!! The Cloak : a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre while inventing some new ones!) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and at one point Christopher Lee himself!; Jon Pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work; Ingrid Pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings; Geoffrey Bayldon (made up to look like Ernest Thesiger) also has a memorably quirky bit; the 'silent-cinema' style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience I suppose - and while some of the humor comes off as heavy-handed a' la THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (1967) or THEATRE OF BLOOD (1973) it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high (and highly unusual) note! Video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory considering I had no other version to compare it with; the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one's enjoyment of the film. As for the extras beginning with the Audio Commentary: frankly this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that I can remember listening to; Jonathan Rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director Peter Duffell to touch on every aspect of the production (whereas with some other films you're left rather expecting there to be more!) and as such it's an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed. The featurette A-Rated Horror Film is a worthwhile effort with Peter Duffell again at center-stage but this time backed up with valid if all-too-brief contributions from producer Max J. Rosenberg and stars Chloe Franks Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon. We also get film notes reviews bios and a poster/stills gallery which again are wonderfully assembled (with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty - and a welcome one at that).

" This is the movie I've seen more times than any other (I believe I saw it on average once every year since it was released). And every time I see it it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex Yu cinematography. This movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. This is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection. ",positive
" After watching this film last night on Sundance I realized that much of Nakata's style was first done in this film. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series especially the idea of the media being the source of the supernatural. Instead of the cursed videotape we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film. In fact the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed videotape in RINGU to mind. The only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through Nakata's later films. The final scenes are quite chilling with a bit of a nod to Murnau what with the door opening by itself ands the ghost entering the room reminds me immediatly of NOSFERATU. A chilling movie that will make think twice about going up to a catwalk. ",positive
" I was about 11 years old i found out i live 0.48 miles from the uncle house. the uncle house is on Westway Dr deer park TX. they have added homes since the movie was made. i don't know the house number but you can go look it up. i am now 21 and i enjoy watching this movie. the bar on Spencer is no longer their. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school their. I drove by the house last week the house still looks great. My dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie. where john cross over the railroad cracks they have made 225 higher. when i hear about john loesing his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time.

" Haven't seen any of the Japanese Grudge-films but I really enjoy this one. I rarely get SCARED when watching films. I can jump if the effect and sound is startling enough but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me. But I did get scared from Grudge. Maybe because I didn't expect anything at all when I watched it. I didn't expect getting scared. I didn't know anything about it either. That was probably a good thing. This is a film that you apparently either love or hate. Most people seem to compare it to the Japanese Grudge-films but even though I haven't seen them I believe it isn't right to compare any film actually. This film stands on it its own. The story is weak most people say. I don't agree. The story is minimalistic and done so on purpose. The story-telling techniques used - the broken time frame for instance - is perfectly done. The director knows exactly what he's doing and I believe he got his vision through as he wanted it. I gave this film 8 of 10. It is a film you will enjoy watching or hate. It's as simple as that.

" Presenting Lily Mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress Judy Garland along with her standard singing moments. The plot consists of Lily Mars tagging along after producer John Thornway for her big break. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this film for everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role! ",positive
" I rate this 10 out of 10. Why? * It offers insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is a great history of surfing; I have never surfed but I love surfing movies and have seen many. None taught me what this movie did * The movie was very well edited. It flowed well. The interviews were outstanding * It's interesting from start to finish In summary it's about as good as a documentary as I have seen so I have to rate in terms of that. So 10/10 ",positive
" Apparently Ruggero Deodato figured out early on that his story wouldn't work if he approached it too seriously so he decided to camp it up. The result is a film that can be viewed as either a ludicrous sword-and-sorcery epic or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'll go the second way. The brief gore moments are well-done the Paul Brothers openly mock the material (they even bark at each other in one scene!) and there is also a charming spirited good-natured performance by Eva La Rue as the girl who tags along with the boys . Plus where else can you see the insides of a dragon lighted like a discotheque?? (***) ",positive
" In the trivia section for Pet Sematary it mentions that George Romero (director of two Stephen King stories Creepshow and The Dark Half) was set to direct and then pulled out. One wonders what he would've brought to the film as the director Mary Lambert while not really a bad director doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King's novel of which he wrote the screenplay. There are of course some very effective grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister Zelda likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film) and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect. But something feels missing at times some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably King-like atmosphere which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in (who knows if he'll save that for his final novel...) As mentioned though some of the casting is terrific notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie to being a little monster (I say that as a compliment of course especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel). And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters who plays this old secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone. And applause goes to whomever did the make-up on Andrew Hubatsek. But there are some other flaws though in the other casting; Dale Midkiff is good not great as the conflicted disturbed father figure Creed and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all. In terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil it does involve a cool Ramones song) and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one) including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining. For the most part it's a very polished directing job though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script. If thought out in logical terms (albeit in King terms) it is really one of his more effective works of the period. But it doesn't add up like it could or should. Still it makes for a nifty little midnight movie. ",positive
" This is a very very early Bugs Bunny cartoon. As a result the character is still in a transition period--he is not drawn as elongated as he later was and his voice isn't quite right. In addition the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a little unusual. Elmer is some poor sap who buys Bugs from a pet shop--there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens! However despite this this is still a very enjoyable film. The early Bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films he messed with Elmer Yosimite Sam and others because they started it--they messed with the rabbit. But in this film he is much more like Daffy Duck of the late 30s and early 40s--a jerk who just loves irritating others!! A true anarchist instead of the hero of the later cartoons. While this isn't among the best Bug Bunny cartoons it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see just how much he's changed over the years. ",positive
" This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep and that's meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here she plays a quiet serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears) and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters and all in all Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements full of quiet moments and wonder.

" Man some of you people have got to chill. This movie was artistic genius. Instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction? A story. Entertainment for God's sake (no pun intended). It seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics--and they're not doing to well. I'm so impressed by the movie and Bill Paxton's job at directing that I'm going to contact him personally to tell him. Ya know if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line you might just enjoy the film. Me and all of my friends did! ",positive
" Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power- he tries to get her to read Nietzche- she says books ain't never done her no good.Soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others.Finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city.We follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank.The dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code.Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims.Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I watched the extended version- the DVD has both versions plus Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge.An interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir.

" From what I've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are wrong to be. Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. It is probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are dealt with well. The film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentinian. So if you've seen Part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in Part 2. ",positive
" It's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes. And none more so that September 11 2001 a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism. No this documentary didn't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11. Rather the filmmakers brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie New York firefighter. They had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training and had handpicked their proby (probation firefighter) to join them in an NY firehouse home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7. But their production was to develop and contain at that time believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Center. I was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of LAN gaming and received a call at about 850pm local time from my Dad who informed me of the above. Few minutes later he told me there was another and that the WTC was under attack. By the time I arrived home the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke and to my horror they collapsed under an hour. The filmmakers had two cameras running that day one who had followed a team out on a routine call and which immediately raced to the WTC upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it. We follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responders of firefighters paramedics and police had to make sense of what happened and to quickly develop a plan of action. The other camera held by the other brother was making his way to WTC to look for his sibling and along the journey captured the many expressions of New Yorkers as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten. Peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7 which miraculously did not suffer any casualty. But being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event. Through the events that unfold we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs to save lives. We began with what the documentary was supposed to be before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures. It's not a film that is fabricated and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary (and heavens not sound stages for Hollywood blockbusters). It's as close as you can get to that day witnessing the event up close from safety. Code 1 DVD contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7. ",positive
" I love this film 'Spring and port wine'. I was born in Leigh a town about 7 miles away from Bolton I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20. My place of work was daily via Little Lever through Farnworth sometimes on a bike but then by car when I could afford it.The film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you if they could. Fred Dibnah was round the corner from Bromwich St. were my bedsit was. If you didn't see the film when first released then you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap such as Coronation St well I agree it is a soap but then it was called 'Kitchen Sink Drama!' Watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on TV I watch mainly for the shots of the locality and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy!

" Otto Preminger's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of LAURA...while that film was glitzy and features the high fa-luting Clifton Webb this film is a whole lot seamier. Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked. Andrews is quite fine (a lot less wooden than he's been in the past) and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim. WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see and a terrific companion-piece to Preminger's equally lurid WHIRLPOOL (also starring Tierney). ",positive

" Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. A dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having killed her own baby. I don't mean to spoil the story for you but you need to know the basics before getting knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison. Buy or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe. This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors. Both Meryl Streep (with her famous Aussie accent) and Sam Neill whose accent is his native-born pronunciation are outstanding. Those with supporting roles are also quite good. You will remember this movie for many years. See it! ",positive
" I love MIDNIGHT COWBOY and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine. What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969 it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X. Of course at that time X meant Maturity. Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie's release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then. However when I try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution (the title itself was slang for a male prostitute); homosexuality; loneliness; physical (and to some extent emotional as well) abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day I can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release. It is worth noting that in the 1970's MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R some of the scenes could almost be rated PG-13 by today's standards. I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie. Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women. He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women. After being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con-man named Enrico Ratso Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman. Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager. Once again Joe is conned and before long is homeless. However Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment. Without giving away much more of the plot I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams. I.E. Joe making it as a gigolo and Ratso going down to Florida where he thinks he can regain his health. I want to make some comments about the movie itself. First of all the acting is excellent especially the leads. Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes. In fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny I find them amusing. For example there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over. Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says Hey I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here! I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry. Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) sends Joe (Jon Voight) to a guy named O'Daniel. What is amusing is that at first we think O'Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O'Daniel is nothing but a religious nut. In addition to the two scenes I mentioned I love the scene where Ratso and Joe are arguing in their apartment when Ratso says to Joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and Joe says in self-defense John Wayne! You gonna tell me he's a fag! What I like is the delivery in that scene. I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late '60's much of it rings true today. That's because although the area around 42nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago. Also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character. One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight's character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that Ratso (Dustin Hoffman's character) was a good influence on him. In conclusion I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on. For example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings. Also what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck (Jon Voight's character) and the people who were in his life in Texas. Even the ending while I don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open-ended. ",positive
" A wonderful film version of the best-selling book and smash Broadway play about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany two African-American sisters who both lived over the age of 100 and told their story of witnessing a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give very good performances as Bessie and Sadie respectively. Amy Madigan also is good as Amy Hill Hearth the white New York Times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present-day ones are very powerful if not quite as inspirational as in the book. That is the only real drawback combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly such as the inter-racial background of the sisters' mother and why their father was so stern. But other than that a very well-done excellently performed powerful movie. ",positive

" Sarafina was a fun movie and some of the songs were really great. Sarafina was very entertaining. I don't normally like music things like this but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box. The movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the Soweto rioting of 1976. It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters. Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government who you can not sympathise with. The singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent. The clothing of the students in Sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from Soweto. They made the movie actually in Soweto which is why it looks very accurate in many parts. All these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied. As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented. As I said before you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective. Also it changes some of the details from other accounts. In Sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students. The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto but this is probably an exaggerated event. The police and army did shoot students but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this. The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime. This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students. The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied. The teacher was arrested for being against the government and the mum goes to work in a white persons house. But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws. -By George S Chris and Finlay ",positive
" Anton Newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject. Watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent. He thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting. The DW are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise. Hey do you haver a drivers license? Anton says to the cameraman Well lets go pawn this guitar! . Great use of archive/ home video material. Great to see rock docs still being made. A cool doc about the creative process. If you like this go see Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sold Out! on DVD. A good experience Anton is this film. 8 out of 10 ",positive
" I'm no fan of newer movies but this one was a real pleasure to watch. Adults and children could watch it together - how unusual! My aunt liked it too. It had laughter tears love adventure special effects good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of a favourite The Wizard of Oz. The hero Paulie an intelligent parrot is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures temptations and disappointments always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend Marie. Highly recommended. ",positive
" October Sky is a highly lauded movie and it¡¦s easy to see why. The story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper the hero finally gets what he wants and it¡¦s a true story. Frankly I think the director¡¦s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates. We don¡¦t see any special narrative or cinematography; the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters. We feel Homer¡¦s desire to earn his father¡¦s recognition and create his own future and his resilience wins our respect. ¡§October Sky¡¨ reminds me of a later 2001 Japanese production of mini series ¡§Rocket Boy ¡¨ which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie. Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison. When October Sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny ¡§Rocket Boy¡¨ offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society. Starring the outstanding actor Yuji Oda ¡§Rocket Boy¡¨ focuses on three men as ordinary as can be: a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother (like what Homer feels in his family) and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea. The collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them ¡§impossible.¡¨ To compensate for his lost ideal Kobayashi (Yuji) works in the tour operator because it¡¦s called ¡§Galaxy.¡¨ When his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him he finally finds strength from his father¡¦s words who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed. ¡§But I don¡¦t regret it ¡¨ his father told Kobayashi ¡§at least I tried.¡¨ It is his father¡¦s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair. Kobayashi¡¦s effort finally fails and he goes back to the travel agency. But his ¡§crazy¡¨ courage inspires his friends and everyone loves him more. Just before the end of the series Kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts. After the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says: ¡§Astronauts Wanted for 2004.¡¨ Kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs just like a kid looking at his ticket to Disneyland. Kobayashi may never get what he wants but he dares his destiny and ¡§just does it.¡¨ This series is so heart-gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy. Unlike Dilbert or other sarcastic writings this show enlightens us and teaches us something. Homer and Kobayashi both have the dream and they do what they can despite other people¡¦s opinions. I recommend other IMDB users to see the Japanese TV series. If you are a nine-to-fiver you will feel more touched. I feel sorry that IMDB doesn¡¦t have its data maybe you can ask somebody from Japan to help you. ",positive
" In the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop. Meanwhile the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of London. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid in her investigation seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer. However she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop. Scoop is another great Woody Allen's comedy outside Manhattan actually again in London. His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic and I laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive in the wrong side . Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in an excellent shape as comedian. However his present muse Scarlett Johansson of whom I am a big fan has over-acting and is annoying in many moments changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation. Her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous and I was quite disappointed with her performance (probably for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): Scoop  O Grande Furo ( Scoop  The Big Scoop ) ",positive
" Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie and I garuntee you will decide that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This movie is about 1hr. 45 mins. and throughout that time there was barely a moment where I wasn't laughing. You will laugh for hours after it is over replaying the punch lines over and over and over in your head. Eddie Murphy has given so many funny performances over his career (48 Hrs. Trading Places Beverly Hills Cop Raw Coming To America The Nutty professor Shrek etc.) but this is by far his MOST HILARIOUS moment. I have seen this movie so many times and it is funnier every time. It never loses its edge. From this day forward every great stand up performance will be emulated from Delirious. ***** and two thumbs up! ",positive
" You'd think you're in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia going through most of Europe - Italy Bulgaria Croatia Slovenia Turkey before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights. Reda's father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the Haj. However since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He can't drive and therefore enlists the help of Reda to his son's protest to get him there in their broken down vehicle. But Reda doesn't see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane. He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn't understand. And hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of pals. The beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water. Through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differences. It's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating. The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination. It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. Don't miss this and yes book early - I was pleasantly surprised that this evening's session was still a full house. ",positive
" Classic highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis. Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloween. Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! The direction often consists of such simple elements shadows dark streets creaking doors that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple yet frighteningly unnerving music score. In a sense Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film! The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer's doctor who's desperate to capture him again. Supporting cast Loomis Soles Castle and others are good too. So like its own villain Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. It is a MUST for all genre fans! **** out of **** ",positive
" I liked this movies. Its a another Yash raj film which you know will look good on screen all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice... Another rule of Yash raj's film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent. Think back to all of those films.. MPK Suman didn't have mom HMAPK Salman didn't have parents AND FINAL rule is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Nath crying... The film is good too. Its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough. The little kid (hero's nephew) is well placed and deliver very good one liners. The actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't get that in real life. this film doesn't have massively big happy families living in BIG house which I thou was a good Idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films. There will be lots of women crying at the end of the film. There isn't a strong message from this film but its a good watch. If you are married (arranged marriage)the film will remind you of what you went through. And if you are not it will inform and may be scare you ... Overall a very good looking film. No big plots or twists but a very gentle film very much like Bollywood classic. ",positive
" i'm gonna give it to ya straight...this movie is amazing. foreign gay films are so fast surpassing American gay films in production quality acting and story. while so many American indie gay films are grainy bad sound amateur acting trite story lines and a surprising lack of any nudity or erotica top-quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from France. the cinematography is beautiful thought out meaningful. the story is adult and complex (but not difficult for anyone to follow) the acting is intense and professional. both leads are fantastic as well as the entire cast. the boys are more than just good-looking and there's plenty of full frontal nudity. you follow the entire year of these boys from their meeting to the end. all the little nuances of a relationship's the details of falling in and out of love are there beautifully performed. it left me wanting more. check it out!

" B Movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. First Movie? Yes. But Aestheically A+. This movie definitely had some bad sound/editing/lighting/acting/etc. etc. problems. However this movie has many positive things about it. First off the most annoying character dies first! Second its made to be a parody/funny B Rated Horror movie. The comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing. The problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie. For what it is just that it is really good. ",positive
" 'Had Ned Kelly been born later he probably would have won a Victoria Cross at Gallipolli'. such was Ned's Bravery. In Australia and especially country Victoria the name Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognised. In Greta he is still a Hero the life Blood of the Town of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created but in Mansfield they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there. Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. From the Old Melbourne Gaol where he was hanged to the Post office he held up in Jerilderie. A cell he was once held in in Greta is on display in Benella and the site of Ann Jones' Hotel the station and even the logs where he was captured in Glenrowan can be visited. Evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over Victoria in police records and even in the Sash that Ned was awarded with for rescuing Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is wrong and whats left out would further justify Neds actions. The Horse that Ned 'stole' was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man who Ned boxes with after getting out of jail). Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it. The Jerilderie Letter is more than what has been stated before. It is not self justification it is Ned's biography an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. So go ahead and read it watch the movie and then make up your mind about what Ned stood for. ",positive
" Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. The human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies because it translates personal subjective opinions on war opposed war action movies where action and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor. The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject and manages to distance itself from usual war movies especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard. The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war. Perfect irony. The acting is truly exceptional and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. Also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted.

" I have to congratulate the genius who approved this one. Edward Furlong you're not as good as you think mate you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap which sole intention has to be to get some bucks. The filming is bad and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result or better. The acting lets just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or at least have some damn experience! The director.. Mr. Jon Keeyes please find your purpose in life as a director you simply suck. Your directing is poor the angles are all messed up (not in a good way) the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper and the damn music.. it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And don't go for writer either by the way. Making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop it requires art and skill things I really doubt you'll ever have. Instead of making a badass shootout movie you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up.. Or just go find a job on a coffeshop. You'll have less stress and you'll save movie goers some money and a bad night. vote: 1/10 (my first one) ",negative
" I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then I'm pretty forgiving of movies. Although I tried I just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on. Although I know it's suppose to be a comedy but I didn't find it very funny. It was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life. In case this is what any of you think country life is like it's definitely not. I do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake. I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it it's just too annoying. ",negative

To be honest the book is better.. ",negative
" I wasted my time and gave this show a chance. This has to be one of the worst new shows. If they gave an award to shows that suck THIS one should sweep the category. The acting is poor and the story line is contrived. Now Dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining. That show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped. This new show based on an insurance companies commercials is not funny and really has nothing going for it. Possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were and still are repeated is what is wrong with this show. It just came to TV and already we are tired of seeing the caveman characters. ",negative
" Plot Synopsis: When his wife a news reporter is kidnapped & replaced with an android double Secret Service agent Eric Phillips tracks her down & uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders. I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid Cyber Tracker . That film was nothing special not to mention a blatant rip-off of both The Terminator & RoboCop . This sequel is the same as before with an all-out action sequence opening the film. There are plenty of explosions heavy gunfire & a huge bodycount as well as some martial-arts moves courtesy of the film's star Don The Dragon Wilson. The whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot. On the acting front Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant. ",negative
" I have been searching for the right words to describe this film. At first I was inclined to simply skip to more significant matters as the film does not rise to a level deserving comment. Yet I stopped puzzled as to how to describe such stuff and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question: What can one say about such a film? Rubbish? No its not rubbish rubbish can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No its not greenhouse gas greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy. Finally I struck on Not even bad a rework of the phrase Not even wrong used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction. That's it then Georgia Rule: Not even bad. ",negative
" This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen as it's absolutely god awful John Carradine has very limited screen time. All the characters are boring and the story is terrible plus I could see the two twists at the end coming miles away!. The great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn't so damn boring and there isn't one character to root for either plus I hope it makes it's way to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally shows up at the end it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by Bee's as it was rather gory. I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion plus it's lucky this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window!. This is one of the most boring Horror films I have ever seen as It's absolutely god awful John Carradine has very limited screen time and I say avoid it like the plague! you don't want to go through the torture. The Direction is absolutely terrible!. Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible! job here making every thing look cheap wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace. The Acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled!!). Merry Anders overacts here terribly as Laura as she didn't convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is OK and somewhat creepy but also overacted she did have a creepy smile at the end though. Rest of the cast I didn't pay enough attention too as I had a lot of trouble getting through it but they were all really bad. Overall please avoid this It's not worth the agony!. BOMB out of 5 ",negative
" Holy crap this movie was bad. I watched it just as a joke. It isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way. This film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry. It worked really well at doing that. It's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie PRIEST added in a bunch of ugly dudes took out anything interesting funny or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese. That's all this is. Cheese. There isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to. There isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in. Why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy? Why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is? Why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film or even a B-movie. Now that I think of it what they hell were they trying to do with this film? I watched it expecting a campy love story and instead I got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying Christian brother tried to destroy it all!!! No I'm not joking. That's what it's about. Does that sound good? This film is pretty ignorant against people of the Christan religion with it's stereotyping of all Christians being loudmouthed rude and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible. A lot of Christian people I know would never speak or act like these freaks. The film however is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well. These have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that ROADKILL video game. It's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that I wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film. The makers of this train-wreck had no strategy for set design acting camera angles lighting script authenticity or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting. There isn't even a single sex scene or at least not a believable one. Jamie Brett Gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all but his good looks were sadly put to waste. This is trash. In a perfect world this film would get voted a 0.0. It's worth 0 as a film alone. A mentally handicapped nun who is blind deaf and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write direct and produce a better film and she'd probably be a better actor as well. the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself. This film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format. I could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x-mas tree and then record that and I've already made a film that will always be better than BEN & ARTHUR by at least half. There are only two things worse than death. Torture and watching BEN & ARTHUR. I'm a homosexual and I will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me and I don't think I've ever been more offended by an entire film than I was by the first five seconds of this film alone. If this movie was a mistake I will personally find a way to change the famous phrase It's okay to make mistakes to It's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was BEN & ARTHUR. You know how people always say things like Good things come out of everything! ? I think that BEN & ARTHUR was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of. To call this movie the worst movie I've ever seen would be giving it WAY too much credit. It's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own. There are good movies there are bad movies and then there's BEN & ARTHUR. This is BEN AND ARTHUR. ",negative
" I see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. The main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it. The camera work ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateur which I could forgive if the direction was more fluent but it wasn't. The sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well. I see could see this director doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off but don't expect a dv movie nearly as good as 28 days later or anything keep your expectations low and you'll get more out of it. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yeah and other than the lead the acting was pretty bad if you ask me. But I'm a movie snob so take that for what that's worth. ",negative
" I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far. I was hoping for a rerun of Hero but this is much much worse. This movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place. No believable characters (even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies these characters are ridiculous) virtually no plot and ridiculous story twists. This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child. Every time you think your silly battle makes some sense they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ( Ah ha you only think you've got me with your super powers and 10 000 ray guns but I ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon so your ray guns don't work and I'm invulnerable to your super powers....tap tap no trade backs infinity PLUS one. ) Children can continue with this lunacy because they don't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time. However for the VIEWER especially the adult viewer this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas. SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu movie makers (a) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on PCP in which case your kung fu is not strong (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back which has a knife in it it will hurt more and do more damage unless it is a fake prop (c) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife you die especially in ancient china where there isn't a Kaiser Permanente around the corner (d) kung fu fights don't last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls and (e) sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations. In any event go watch Hero again because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible. ",negative
" Steve Carpenter cannot make horror movies. First of all the casting was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This movies has no gore(usually a key ingredient to a horror movie) no action no acting and no suspense(also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it's sad. There were a few parts that were supposed to be funny(continuing the teen horror/comedy movies) and no one laughed in the audience. I thought that this movie was rated R and I didn't pay attention and realized it had been changed to PG-13. Anyway see this movie if you liked I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. That's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary. And seriously this is to you Steve Carpenter stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. ",negative
" All the other comments already said what I was going to say here goes anyway. I thought this was Italian at first sorry about that Italy. I wasn't bored because I kept waiting for something to happen. Who did that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather way back when? Was it Alan Parsons? Saw this on a Brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected terrible. Full of streaks and stuff. The movie was an incoherent mess. Goofy music and clueless characters. The main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients. I thought the doctor directing the battle scene was never going to end. Had some good looking babes though. It seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked. I gave it a 2 for the nekkid women. That bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs. Poe probably did about 3 000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his. ",negative
" I have never read the Bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what I've gathered it will be interesting (when I finally do read it and I will). My comments will be based purely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and was so excited but when I finally did I was so disappointed it hurt. This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish. The actors were not well cast (though Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). The kid actors it seemed were merely asked to show up get in the characters' clothes say the lines and make the faces. The set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised at the awfulness of it that I had to go online and check who directed it just to see the kind of work he had done. The editing was cut and paste and the plot (screenplay) was just that as well (even though the author had been involved himself irony?). The building up of the tension fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came. I've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. It had so much potential. Unfortunately the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story. ",negative
" This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments in the movie A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. When on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps HUH!! Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss take my word for it!

" The makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences.In other words this film is every liberals worst nightmare!The political agenda is so heavy-handed here and the style of the film is so low-key that it just loses steam pretty quickly.Regardless of which side of the fence you're on I'd recommend skipping it.

" I saw the 10p.m. showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater wanting my time back (as I don't actually pay for movies anymore) I didn't really find any redeeming qualities. There were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger (in mind more than age as this film is rated R) male audience. The fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line but let's be honest it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off. The only truly horrible part of the film was the CG which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen. Now I am a reasonable man I knew going into the theater that I wasn't going to be seeing Casablanka and I am at least thankful that this film is an original (albiet inane) idea and not some re-make or franchise spin off. However to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months.

" One of if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s. This tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it. In turns gratuitous puerile uncouth and unrealistic this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny provocative intellectual and controversial. Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. It's no surprise that this was the late Andrea Dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen. Complete and utter rubbish on every level. ",negative
" The movie was OK . Not bad not good just OK. If there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far. Sadly Fast and Furious 2 also stunk but I'd rather see this than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk this will be a cute movie for you. Personally I'd wait for HBO or Blockbuster. ",negative
" What a fantastic premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It should have it all. Tragedy. Suspense. Comradeship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. love and Tears. What we've got is a film with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so but he fails miserably. He acts so wooden that at any given moment he should crack. He tries to play the tough guy instead of being a tough guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Cause they were throwing stones in a lake? Cause he brings her coal bricks? The SFX are very very well done. Too much though. The hundreds or so planes over Berlin look like an attack-fighter-formation-squadron rather than an organised airlift  as it actually was. Interestingly enough the White House the Kremlin and General Lucius D. Clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set. Notice the same drapes hanging deep down the windows as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? By the way GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY comes across as a small time insecure looser General who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift. He was very much the opposite. So you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion no suspense and no historic accuracy. Sad it started out so promising ",negative
" The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film. I have no words no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film I sat through last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast. The dialog was so contrived the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the film has been so many times before that I am shocked someone thought it was an original idea. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD film.

" I really must watch a good movie soon because it seems every other entry or so is something that I despise. However my history speaks I must not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels. I never thought that I would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did. Al Pacino isn't acting in this film: he's posing. There are many many scenes of his character who is a race car driver just staring at the camera. He's perfectly awful. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two are supposed to be in a love affair and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever. Sydney Pollack directed this film? There's no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here. Is this the same man I cheered for in Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a horrible movie experience. Run don't walk away from Bobby Deerfield. ",negative
" I had a feeling that after Submerged this one wouldn't be any better... I was right. He must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product... his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish. It's nothing more than a B or C-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an OK sound designer. Like the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post-production (...voice dubbing etc.) Too bad cause the plot's actually OK for a SG flick. I'll never rent another SG flick unless he emails me asking for forgiveness. Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock... --jimbo ",negative
" This movie does have some great noirish/neorealist visuals and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar-coating which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes go on for much too long (the wedding especially) and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen. The dialog was particularly distracting and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on. Most of the characters were either Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a Shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks. Toward the end I was laughing and not because the filmmakers wanted me to. I guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking Italian and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk. But it absolutely did not work for me. Another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason: the main character's son born and raised in New York in the 1920's suddenly picks up a lovely lilting British accent. I'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England. I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intention but a considerably lower grade for execution. ",negative
" This was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it's low budget trappings. The use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably. They made good use of the small budget I guess. I just wish the story and most of the acting was better. There are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they don't. Confusing and unbelievable story. Bad DVD transfer too. It doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. This I had to shut off. It was too boring. I can do slow movies. But just make them appealing in some aspect. Visually story-wise acting etc. This was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience. Maybe the film maker's next attempt will be better. ",negative
" It's hard to tell if Noonan and Marshall are trying to ape Abbott & Costello Martin & Lewis Curley & Larry or some other comedy team but whoever it was they were trying to imitate they failed miserably. There's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture. Noonan (who helped write the alleged script ) and Marshall have no chemistry whatsoever; Marshall seems to be trying for a Dean Martin type of devil-may-care coolness but he doesn't come even remotely close. God knows what Noonan thought he was doing but being funny sure wasn't it. He seems to think that flapping his arms and legs a lot and staring dumbly at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy; maybe for him it is but not for the audience. I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out. It was on the bottom of a double bill with a three-year-old Jeff Chandler western ( Pillars of the Sky which was pretty good) and a Three Stooges short ( Sappy Bullfighters which wasn't) and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen; it was so staggeringly unfunny that it didn't even measure up to the worst of the Three Stooges shorts. I stayed around for the end of it (not that I wanted to but my folks weren't due to pick me up until after the movie ended) and by the time this mess was over I was the only one in the theater. I saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing it had going for it was Julie Newmar who was as smokingly hot as ever; other than her this thing has absolutely NOTHING to recommend it. The two of them also play Japanese soldiers and the way they do it makes Jerry Lewis' infamous playing of Japanese characters as thick-lensed buck-toothed gibbering mental defectives look benign by comparison. Marshall went on to host Hollywood Squares and Noonan kept trying his hand at making movies but most of them were almost as bad as this. Not quite though as I don't think ANYTHING could be quite as bad as this. A truly pathetic waste of film. Don't waste your time on it. ",negative
" As other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by Kate Capshaw who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she's in. Connery is fine as is Fishbourne but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration to the point where it becomes laughable. If you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see otherwise skip it.

" I don't know about you but what I love about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan sees Jerry leaving Tom behind to have an adventure in New York and as far as I am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat! As magical as Jerry's exploration of the 'Big Apple' might be for the other T&J fans who have commented here on IMDb I couldn't wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end so I could watch the next cartoon on my DVD. In fact the only part of the whole episode that I genuinely enjoyed was when Jerry almost 'buys the farm' hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road.

" After being hugely entertained by Mr. Brosnan's performance as a cad in The Tailor of Panama (which I rate 10/10 across the board: casting acting script story editing pace music emotional impact etc.) I enthusiastically anticipated this film. I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film vulgar for the sake of being vulgar bankrupt in every way that The Tailor of Panama is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the good part; it never came. I neither laughed nor cried although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7? Hardly. ",negative
" Years ago when I was a poor teenager my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay. And while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to I couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I came to see crap like the second Conan movie and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN! Now despite this being a wretched movie it is in places entertaining to watch--in a brain dead sort of way. And technically the stunts and camera-work are good so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well unlike the first Rambo movie this one has virtually no plot Rambo himself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells) there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped romance and the movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hits its mark! And while the bad guys are using AK-47s helicopters and rockets in some scenes all Rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! The scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers! It was wonderfully parodied in UHF starring Weird Al. Plus HOT SHOTS PART DEUX also does a funny parody of the genre--not just this stupid scene. All-in-all a movie so dumb and pointless it's almost like self-parody! ",negative
" They Are Among Us is poor science fiction at best. Mediocre acting bogs down this film. The plot holes are numerous. Aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human. In their alien form they supposedly have exo-skeletons (which is why they need the plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails. The heroine's father disappeared after Project Blue Book closed but was supposedly an F-16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie pick Invasion of the Body Snatchers and see how it is done right. ",negative
" I generally don't give worry much about violence in films or a vast amount of philosophy symbolism or psychology. All this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us. There is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature a good setting of characters a good direction. This film could be voted for as a good film. However it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting. First of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film. Not movie violence I am talking about REAL violence. This violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two; the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women. Not that we all don't have some real twists with women.(respectively men). But the conclusion of the film ruins it all. *spoiler* Our heroine finally dies (by here own hand if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and it enraged me now the guy is out with a new film witch I am certainly not going to watch)and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon nature growing over her in particular her sex.. Of course it is the director who kills the women heroine. Women have to die especially if men are attracted by their sexuality. That seems to be the final conclusion.**end spoiler* Well well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself. But to use big pictures artsy directions cruelty to living creatures just to say men can be frightened of women and men are cruel to women. Thats just not enough. I knew when I saw this film it would achieve good critics for the philosophical eastern and artistic and whatever approach. But to me this film is just totally marred. ",negative
" this movie was horrible. I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this movie again if I were payed to. The so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played. There was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $7.50 I payed to see it. Don't go see it don't rent it don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie. Shame on you Sarah for being associated with this horrible horrible movie. Horrible movie no need to ever see it. ",negative
" Few films have left me with such a feeling of unease and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (How it ended there I can only wonder) I was subjected to 90 mn of hateful derivative garbage the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie Don't answer the phone - but worse. The nastiness of it all rape and all is shown without any distance (unlike strong stuff like Last house on the left ) and utter contempt for the (perfect ?) victims and everybody involved leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur. At the end I felt like taking a shower. No credits to the director ",negative
" I just got through watching this DVD at home. We love Westerns so my husband rented it. He started apologizing to me half way through. The saddles costumes accents--everything was off. The part that made me so mad is where the guy didn't shoot the collector with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul. His only excuse was he only had 2 arrows left. We watched it all the way through and as someone else said...too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. I mean the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found what's the point of that? And why were there a grave yard where everyone died on April 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around? If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers this may be your movie. However if you want a real Western you will hate this movie. ",negative
" i should qualify that title now that i think about it. Checkout is not entirely worthless. i've had the opportunity to see it twice and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie's expense. so i guess it's worth something for that. and also it's worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing. as another reviewer pointed out this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word. not a single original thought went into this movie (which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me). the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie. it is definitely not the next Clerks it is definitely not original and it is absolutely not good clean fun. the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated (after seeing it a first time the second time can be quite funny in an insulting sort of way). as i looked around the theater it was obvious that nearly everyone barring perhaps the elderly were completely bored or pained by this movie. during some of the particularly emotional scenes like where Nick chews out his mother the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done. i even heard someone *groan* in the theater something i had heretofore never witnessed. i don't care where you have the chance to see this movie be it at a film festival or in a indie theater or wherever. do yourself a favor skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you're like me and just can't resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made.

" This film although not totally bad should have been filmed where the actual events took place. Grand Island Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of June 3 1980. Grand Island is situated in the nearly treeless flat Platte River Valley in Hall county. The makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of Ontario and moved the whole event to a non-existant town called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie. ",negative
" I feel the movie did not portray Smith historically. The goal of this movie was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be comfortable to the LDS Church leaders historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The movie was designed to be a faith promoting experience not a balanced view of Smith as a man. I have taken it upon myself to study Smith's life and have read both LDS works and none LDS works. The movie like most LDS projects was beautifully filmed and well acted. However this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. A significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that Smith had when he was seven. While this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is in portraying Smith's teen years the film is silent regarding the Smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820's. Another problem is while the movie shows Joseph Smith good-naturedly entering into wrestling contests it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent. I could go on and on. This movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment. ",negative
" At the end of this episode Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for posterity.For a good reason! The super sleuth left his little grey cells(sorry Agatha)at home for this tale. There is no deductive reasoning no acute analysis of signs at crime scenes. Holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot. The dastardly CAM is finally dealt to by an old frail-in a manner that would have made Charles Bronson's heart swell with pride-six bullets in the breadbasket.In an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of Watson's shoes.Mercifully the writer didn't decide to tack on the story of Cinderella to lengthen the film.The murderess Holmes and Watson escape scot free.

" No this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach fairy godmother and the glass slippers but if I were to elaborate I would have to spoil it for you which I won't. But don't let curiosity get the better of you as this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those movies that start off promisingly before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline. And that's real horror. Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One's a successful plastic surgeon while the other your dutiful obedient and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like hand in glove so close you'd think of them more as siblings rather than parent-child. But things start to go wrong (don't they always) when Hyun-soo's friends whom Yoon-hee has operated on start to go berserk. Perhaps it's a warning to audiences and for those Koreans ladies who don't bat an eyelid when going under the knife if news reports are to be believed. The only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery though somehow I thought Kim Ki-duk's Time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself. It's a tale of two halves the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics which I admit did get to me now and then. However the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo-jumbo melodramatics and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat. Some things begin not to make sense and while attempts are always presented to explain you probably won't buy it not that horror movies are logical to begin with. The leads are all beautiful and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role. But hey I'm not complaining though the storyline could have been improved tremendously. I'd recommend you to watch this only if you're a fan of mediocre Korean horror on VCD. Watch out for those face off-ish moments! ",negative
" We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books. While not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films. Some great examples are the Harry Potter series the Lord of the Rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every Disney film ever made. However I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies. Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine L'Engle's fan base it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience. Mind you I'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary I went into this affair with an open mind. I figured that a made-for-T.V. movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script. After all the Star Wars spin-off Ewoks was decent if a little silly. Come to think of it the original Star Wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took George Lucas! However from the first scene onward disappointment started enveloping me as if I'd gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering. The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 (a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic) Mrs. Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time. The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief. Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our favorite star-turned-mentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow. That's right a crow. Moreover the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old; the majestic half-man half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle. Had I been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life. The worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single unmoving cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T. Having gotten the most painful part out of the way I must go on to the tear-inducing one: the characters the acting and the story. I personally had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films: plain hair glasses and a figure most supermodels would find laughable. She was always a slightly anxious humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua. In the film she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever. In fact she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins her school principal who continuously has to deal with her. Calvin the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock! The irony is horrible. As for the memorable Happy Medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of swings. The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace Mrs. Whatsit and the Man With Red Eyes (nicknamed the Dude With Red Eyes due to his complete reinvention as a character). The story is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work. Here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed. As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flat-nosed wookies of Ixchel (who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks) tear the spine up. As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the Earth-like Camazotz was the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil. I am very sorry that this film exists. I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad. It's the way the characters are written that ruins it. A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic scored by John Williams given its sound at Skywalker Sound edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox. In its current state the film is unworthy to be shown to self-respecting people. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad. The book was Good the film was Bad and Mrs. Whatsit was Ugly. Score: 0.1/10 (If I could) Pros: They got the names right. Cons: It had horrible problems with the Cliffs Notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book. Oh and the main cover/poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle. Some might say that this symbolizes high adventure. I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn't even bother to Photoshop Meg's arm on properly. ",negative
" This film is not funny. It is not entertaining. It does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation. Added to that it's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory. It's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like. This movie is boring obnoxiously mind-numbing and at times offensive and disgusting. At most it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. Also it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time. ",negative
" I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain. This one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut. Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids. Which of them is the slasher? The actual killings are not very gory so this video nastie is not really nasty. There is the requisite flashing of the boobies but it has nothing to do with the college kids. I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be right. Maybe I've seen too many of these. The end twist was clever; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality. ",negative
" Sorry but aside from Kim Basinger doing a good job acting scared this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in awhile. Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard. Yet no one seems to notice. Then instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit. I can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs carrying a red toolbox screaming for God to come help her and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others.

" I'm beginning to see a pattern in the movies I give a 1 to. They are almost all movies that my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop having faith in her taste in movies. Anyway this is typical drivel aimed at pre-teen girls but done even more poorly than usual. Once again the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie. He/she made the main character unlikable. She starts off by being a complete b*tch to her friend at the beginning and then finds out when she becomes 30 that she's basically a sh*tty person (having affairs etc.). Why the F would we feel for this person? OK let's say we can get past that. Jennifer Garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity. I don't know if it's her or the writer's fault but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13 year olds are NOT entertaining they're annoying. Far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to Thriller . Holy crap that was painful. It showed her practicing that dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows it but an entire club full of people?!? Argh!!! The Macarena would be more believable! All of a sudden she's completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices? At least Tom Hanks' character on Big had a job that made sense to a child. These body-switching/child becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand and this is by far the worst one yet. ",negative
" I watched this on the tube last night. The actor's involved first caught my attention. The first scenes were attention getters. Some funny some sad. Good character development. I felt that the latter third of the film diverged. If it was not for the early part of the movie I would have stopped watching. I kept watching wanting to how how it tied together. Unfortunately I feel that it never happened. I especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish (?). Was that the other shoe? Would I recommend? No I think not. As other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated (60's jive) but it was not too distracting. The ending totally turned me off. ",negative
" The plot sounded like it had promise. To be honest I did not watch the entire movie. After about an hour into the movie I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth watching until it conclusion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. Nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human / wolf transplant. It was because the movie was badly written acting lacked emotion and I did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes. When he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying If you can't run with the big dogs don't leave the porch kept running through my bored mind. Save yourself the time and skip this movie. I can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as I did wondering why anyone waste money time energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to American cinema.

" I think Dolph Lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la Schwarzenegger Stallone and even Van Damme to certain degree. He had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career. The strange thing about Jill The Ripper (or Jill Rips...or Tied Up) is that I honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? It shows in the way that they describe it on IMDb on the DVD case in the commentaries and this film is not serious. To call it campy would be a huge understatement. The film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow confusing and gratuitous. On top of that they put Lundgren who is known for action films in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited. The entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? Just the plot and premise immediately make it a B-Movie Porn at very best. Dolph Lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic Matt Sorenson who decides to play Detective when his brother is murdered. I mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has Lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes and witnesses and everything else even though he's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from Lundgren. Danielle Brett is Lundgren's eventual love interest and his brother's widow. Brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. The supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by Victor Pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain. I honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasn't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where Lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. To explain how classy and well done this movie is (sarcasm...sarcasm) the back of the DVD I picked up (it was really cheap) has Lundgren's character listed as Murray Wilson (not the name of his character in the film.) While somehow Lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious. Considering director Anthony Hickox is infamous for really B-Movie Horror flicks it only makes sense even though I think he was really trying to be serious. Hard core cult Lundgren fans will have to see it...no one else should...certainly for any sort of mystery or suspense. 3/10 ",negative
" I don't often give one star reviews but the computer won't let me do negative numbers. The opening titles tell us we're in deep water already. Although this is a low budget exploitation film there are 17 producers credited. No. No. At the beginning of the story abusive husband Kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community. The house is a pigsty. His wife Della (Kim Basinger) has let the children run amok all day. OK. We're already in deep water. Ms. Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. Uh are these her children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della drives to the mall a lengthy scene that could have been cut. To bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Sure. For a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it. We get some actual suspense in the driving scenes though. It's raining and traffic is bad. First we see Della try to drive and smoke at the same time. Then later Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone. She wanders the mall sees an old friend from college tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined- gosh maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going broke but that's too complicated for the script to follow. In the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films. One White boy (Lukas Hass watching his career go down the toilet) one Black one Asian and one Hispanic. Imagine a company of Up with People gone to the bad and you'll have the idea. Although they have a gun she gives them attitude. A mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head firing more than once. The parking lot is crowded as can be people everywhere and nobody notices. Della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area she drives to a construction site where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools (literally) at hand. MAJOR spoiler ahead. She drives back home. The car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain. Checks on the children goes downstairs and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range. The experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for Della. Instead we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in foster care or a group home because the State will collect them while she answers to murder one charges. The four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense. The husband different story. I'm so glad I saw this on cable. If I'd seen it in a theater (did it get any release?) I'd have been furious. As is I'm just sad seeing talents like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas waste themselves on garbage like this. One very good thing though. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Ms. Montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd. There is justice in the world. ",negative
" I haven't seen Henry Fool but after watching Fay Grim I'm not sure I want to. Maybe Hartley aims to be the anti-thriller director---he sure succeeded with this yawner. Based on the official description---woman discovers that her dead husband's manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security---I expected a taut geopolitical drama. Instead I got flimsy structure goofy dialog flabby characterizations a convoluted plot and a tone that shifts so often it suggests that Hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time. I can hang for a long time with a frustrating hard-to-follow plot (e.g. Duplicity ) because I figure that the loose ends eventually will come together. Even when they don't or they do but they leave lingering questions (e.g. Duplicity ) sharp writing and acting can hold one's interest. But half-way through Fay Grim I reached a deadly realization---I didn't know what was going on and I didn't care. Too bad because I really like Parker Posey reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent estranged wife and indifferent clueless mother to tough shrewd international player capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists. There's also bad casting. Jeff Goldblum can be very good but he's not capable of overcoming miscasting as a CIA operative. He looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as I was watching him in it. His CIA sidekick is worse; he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of American Idol (are there really young CIA agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads?). Then there's the sticky question of the characters' ages. Goldblum was 54 when he made Fay Grim ; Thomas Jay Ryan who plays Henry Fool was 44. Neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages. Yet a key point in the story is that they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua back in the '70s. Goldblum's character would've been in his 20s then; Henry Fool would've been a teenager. Was Hartley being quirky or lazy? The problems are too numerous to list... ",negative
" I saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke. If the ranking had a zero this movie would get it. The dinosaurs were awful. The storyline was ridiculous. The acting really doesn't qualify to be called acting. The only reason I even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how BAD it really was. ",negative
" Oh dear. good cast but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task. Even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right. Im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times. The main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue that made some people in the film annoying. It may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task. And the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film. Overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me but I'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good. Sorry. ",negative
" The comedic might of Pryor and Gleason couldn't save this dog from the tissue-thin plot weak script dismal acting and laughable continuity in editing this mess together. It has a very few memorable moments but the well dries up quickly. As a kid I remember this as a Luke-warm vehicle for the two actor-comedians but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot overall. Watching it again after many years it screams schlock-a-mania. I'm not so concerned with the racial controversy as I wouldn't mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little levity. The most obvious fault to me is that the scenes are laid out like a jumbled non-related series of 2 minute situation comedy bits (any not very good ones at that) that were stapled together by the editor after an all-nighter at the local watering hole. Characters change feelings and motivations on a dime without rhyme nor reason between scenes and within scenes making this feel as though no one had any idea of what to get out of the screenplay. Not that it was any gem to start with. I feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made. Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined...

" This movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century / pre-WWII India where the British and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true Indians are good. Surely such clichéd depictions of the British are rather passé now. Apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable the acting is pedestrian and two-dimensional and the directing obvious and unimaginative. The story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in. All in all rather uninspiring. Oh and Linus Roache just cannot do tragedy - going cross-eyed with emotional pain just doesn't work for me! ",negative
" I just finished reading a book on Anita Loos' work and the photo in TCM Magazine of MacDonald in her angel costume looked great (impressive wings) so I thought I'd watch this movie. I'd never heard of the film before so I had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever. Thought it got off to a cute start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he doesn't know exists. The scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that won't stay on was really endearing. I was even with the film when Eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel. But after a while it just started to fall apart for me. Eddy stays asleep for the entire rest of movie so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from there on doesn't really matter because he's just dreaming. The rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless. I had to force myself to stick with it. And the final number where MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky. Had Eddy woken a sooner and the original story continued or had he really married an angel I think it would have been a lot more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real character. There weren't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first few songs were good but the jitterbug number that MacDonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard. Completely wrong for her operatic voice. Even so Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine showing what true stars they were. ",negative
" Wow... I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it had been released early. I've been following this online for some time and just had to buy the film. Wow... I guess the thing that really struck me was the editing or lack thereof. Time and again characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking. I am not an editor but I do know that you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them arriving at point B. There is no need to show almost the entire journey! Wow... I actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. They seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy depending on what action was to be added at a later date. Wow... Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still employs miniatures sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities including London. At times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one shot in London there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair. Wow... Why Timothy Hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while. ",negative
" I don't think this movie was rated correctly. I took my copy and blacked out the PG rating and wrote down R. I would NOT recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18 whatever the R limit is. Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women. I don't know about you but that's not something for little children to be watching. True it might be the traditional clothing style of the African (?) Indians but... I think partial nudity should give a movie an R rating. I haven't seen the movie recently but I guess otherwise it was alright. ",negative
" This movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings. Shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in Shaq-Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible film-making that is Steel. There's not a single good thing to be said about this movie. I saw it a bunch of times when I was very young but I must've been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart. It's fun to mock. I saw it on the Disney Channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that. Although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness. If you see it on TV try this: consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genie powers. If you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him. That's kinda funny and disturbing. A horrible example of film. Do not unless looking to mock it see this movie. ",negative
" This movie sucked plain and simple. Okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist. The rapist is a douche but the girl victim is partly to blame. I mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff but when the rapist tries to have sex with her she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her. And the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything but when it comes to the rapist getting raped it's a pretty long rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching. 3.2/10 ",negative
" This movie really shows its age. The print I saw was terrible due to age but it is possible that there are better prints out there. However this was not the major problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933 it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered (only a few sentences) in the film in the most amateur fashion. Sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces--all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and cleaverly (?) hide the fact that the film was dubbed. Well its true that this Czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious. It just looked cheap. Overall the film looked low budget and silly. It's really a shame though because there was a grain of a good story--a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and/or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. EVEN with a few glimpses of the naked (and somewhat chunky) Hedy Lamarr it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even by 1933 standards this film was a poorly made dud. About the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different Lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image Hollywood created when she came to America--she looks like 2 completely different people. It's such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film I don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews. For technical problems alone the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it. ",negative
" It had to be You is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This picture is about Charlie Hudson a former police officer turned Author. When Charlie's fiancé goes out of town he's stuck with all of the wedding planning. He spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married. The two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together. This is when the plot gets boring Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch. ",negative
" Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut this time it's a film that's played for ermlaughs. While on a diving trip Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea her feet as you might expect encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch but he fails miserably in this ham fisted vanity project. The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding every woman in the film is a dither head who likes bending over is front of the camera Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. There's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief this was a film made by real men for real men to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality it's a shameful shambles. ",negative
" Hooper is Not Funny Not Fasted paced Not romantic and Non informative. There is no real drama. You would think that a movie about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama there was an attempt but it didn't seem real. No Character study no lessons learned it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun they were just trying to act like they were having fun. There is no reason to watch unless you like to look at Burt and want get an occasional glimpse of Sally. Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. In fact Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time ",negative
" I just finished watching guinea pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this movie although having very good FX better then I expected was NOT a good movie. I honestly cant say that I enjoyed this movie at all. Of course It is effective in its way of being a shocking realistic twisted 43 minutes of torture but I found it to be very boring (and not as gory as i hoped). And also I found that the torturers were very annoying when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time that ruined it even more (and Im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one). I have now seen guinea pig 1 2 3 5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the flesh and blood. I wont say much more about Devils experiment other than Great fx descent acting from the girl annoying fu**ing torturers overall I give it 4 stars on account of the FX cos they are awesome.

" Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the film was okay. It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing. Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others. The problem isn't with direction acting or anything technical. The movie is just destroyed in the third act. Why? The murders twists turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that? The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's Planet of the Apes THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever. What a let down. ",negative
" What Is It? is a mish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs (snails Shirley Temple swastikas and overtly racist music among others) unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development. The whole thing struck me as self-consciously freak show and I don't mean only the unusual casting decisions. It has the feel of a bad acid trip far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie to which I can compare it is Eraserhead (my second-least-favorite film of all time) which was by intent much more depressing but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time. It's one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else's mind -- even someone else's chemically altered consciousness -- but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness.

" Supposedly a social commentary on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970's Nightmare is full of bad Southern stereotypes complete with phoney accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised babe in prison movie--especially in its uncut original version. Nevertheless acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors in particular does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. There's also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed who appears as the lecherous warden and Tina Louise (previously Ginger of Gilligan's Island ) made a rather believable sadistic prison guard. My grade: D. ",negative
" I am a huge Charlton Heston fan. He is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time but what was he thinking when he made this movie. Normally if he made a bad movie I could blame it on the screenwriter or director but in this case it's all him. The suckiness of this movie is all his fault. It proves that not even Heston can make a Shakespeare story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and I'll never get that time back. This is by far THE WORST Heston movie that I've ever seen. If you are a Shakespeare fan maybe you'll find this movie entertaining but if you're not don't waste your time you'll regret it in the long run. ",negative
" I don't know what the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal movies for but I watch them because as silly as they are they're at least always good for a laugh. Why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of? Attack Force is by no means a great movie but I felt it was as worthy a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other movies; in fact I didn't think it was one of his worst by a long-shot. It had most of the time a half-way coherent plot line and it was most of the time fundamentally exciting. The ending really sucked but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements. In the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised but I actually thought that the acting characterization (if I may use such a big word) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect. Seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone-faced no-nonsense man's man that we've come to expect and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well without ever up-staging him. This people is what a Steven Seagal movie does. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh at it. 4 out of 10. ",negative

" I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. That's because I love wacky foreign comedies--particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise. However although this one frequently caught me by surprise these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park in that nearly EVERY social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny. For example after exploring adultery drug abuse (of nearly every sort--ranging from pot heroin speed to glue sniffing) prostitution S&M suicide murder etc. the movie got to the hilarious(?) topic of pedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about 12 years-old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work! Funny?! You've got to be kidding. This movie just goes too far and delves into the black hole of comedy . What should they make fun of next cancer or rectal tumors? ",negative
" Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game; he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So as an adaptation it's a success. Unfortunately it's still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here so don't expect the movie to be actually any good. while it does have it's moment Postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through. At its core Postal is a satire on the United States as done by a twelve year old kid. Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value: the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include..well pretty much everything else. After the initial surprise wears off Postal simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity. This probably would have worked as a short movie but it's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). There are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 4/10 ",negative
" I saw this movie just now not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in Israel. and to summarize everything right now I will just say: this is not a good film. This is Dror Shaul's second feature film and I have to admit that his first and the TV drama he made before this picture are much better. further more this is his first attempt at directing a drama. the early works were comedies and were funny and effective. The first thing you have to know if you'll ever see this film: Israel of the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of Israel. the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire and some of them disappear one by one. the kibbutz Hebrew word for collective was a sort of village for members only where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life. with the change in social values with time it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed locked within the dogma rules with no ticket out. the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the 90's and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive. the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that. But I regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz. once it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment. but the film shows the opposite. that the kibbutz with it's socialist dogma was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective. this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism: your individuality is the most important thing. you must place yourself in the center and no one else but you is the matter. this is the philosophy the film stands for and that's just it's first sin. If you disagree with me on the political side I'm sure you will agree that the acting the tone of the film it's script and it's direction are the four sins that follow. the film has no real visual text and none of it's shots is something to remember. it is also very delicate a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions which do not surface not in the film and not with the viewer. it brings nothing but boredom. Can someone please explain: why this film won so many prizes? maybe because it shows that Israel is in line with the rest of the world hating socialist and human values? or maybe it shows that Israel is a delicate place not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism? that we are basically very human and good people capable of emotions especially when they are fake ones just like capitalism expects us to be? or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of Israeli cinema in recent years a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the Jewish state? no matter what the answer is it's not a good one. not for the world not for human values and not for the Jews.

" I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc. But everything in this movie is bad. Farting jokes people getting eaten and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the worst of all time. It's a really bad film that you have to stay away from. All the jokes are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this. ",negative
" Man I really find it hard to believe that the wonderful Alan Ball had anything to do with this mess. Having seen the first two episodes thus far I think I can safely say this show isn't going to be on my must see list. It's just got so many things working against it. None of the actors cast are particularly good. Anna Paquin as the lead character Sookie is just awful. I remember her being better in a lot of other things I've seen her in so maybe it's just the writing. She's not really much fun to look at either there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly. The actor who plays Bill is marginally better if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof. The other actors do their best but with the cliché characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it's a tough job. Tara is an absolute misery to watch Rutina Wesley absolutely murders the accent. It's like nails on a chalkboard bad. Almost as awful is Nelsan Ellis it's difficult to understand what he's even saying sometimes. Both his character as well as Tara's also seem a bit racist to me. I don't know having a character say 'whycome' on an HBO show that isn't The Wire just seems a bit odd. Rounding out the cast so far are Sookie's doddering grandmother her sex addict brother and the only bit of genius casting I've seen in William Sanderson as the sheriff. The story seems to be meandering towards it's destination at this point with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested. The romance stuff is very Dark Shadow-sy. Although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old Dark Shadows episodes times about ten. At times it seemed so campy to me that I just have to assume it was intended to be. But unlike a show such as Buffy that pulled camp off masterfully this show does not. Out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show. I'm not averse to either of these when they are done well as they have in many other HBO shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving Jason Stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointless. About the only nice thing I can really think to say about this mess is that I liked the opening title sequence. HBO has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately I hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air. ",negative
" This is one of the worst movies I saw! I dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap. Don't waste your time watching this. Good actors but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues. Hope there'll be no Blanche 2 :-) Avoid this movie by all means! ",negative
" - When the local sheriff is killed his wife takes over until and is determined to clean-up the town. Not everyone in town however is happy with what she's doing. When the sheriff orders a curfew in town the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. There's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love. - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. In more capable hands or with a larger budget Gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie. - There are just so many things wrong with the movie: a supporting cast with no acting ability stilted and unnatural dialogue and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is the editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors (and horses for that matter) obviously waiting for Corman to yell Action . The best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building. All of a sudden they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles. Or take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town. We see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse. - It's not as if Corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with. While none were great stars Beverly Garland John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance. But in Gunslinger they're not given much to work with. - I have now seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would strongly recommend going the MST3K route. ",negative
" Well I can once and for all put an end to the question: 'What is the worst movie ever made...ever?' It is Flight of Fury starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Sure there are lots of famously bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously. It is a Romanian-made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood. It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. It was released only on video (I can't imagine why) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVD's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling. ",negative
" Oh brother. The only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because it's at least historically noteworthy as the first Three Stooges film (when they weren't yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny Ted Healy). But even as a longtime Stooges fan I'd have to say that young Moe Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to Mr. Healy's taller boss janitor. They're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on-and-off-again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing. Most of this toothache deals with Jack Pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates Baron Munchausen (here's a good example of the level of humor: I object! On what grounds? Coffee grounds! ). His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante but even the schnoz himself is a bore. ",negative
" I very nearly walked out but I'd paid my money and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. After the endearing wide-eyed innocence of A New Hope and the thrilling sophistication of The Empire Strikes Back I remember awaiting Return of the Jedi with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage I was bitterly disappointed and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first). From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba's lair this film was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable profit-making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky that vile muppet-pet of Jabba's the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc. etc. ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. Fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection. The blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating. Lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from A New Hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I can't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that I could dream up and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in and I get a cut from every single one. It'll make me even more obscenely rich. There may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total absolute sell-out to profit. ",negative
" Film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny. Her fans will say she's scathingly honest and that may be true. But she's also shrill with an unapologetic in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre. She doesn't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *1/2 from **** ",negative
" I can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse (supposibly children's) film i have ever seen in my life. I took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins. The sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film. They should pay YOU to watch it not you pay them. It's truly truly awful there is no other way to describe it. The people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences. Aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren Regards Stephen ",negative
" ***SPOILERS*** Let's start with the good of this film--the serviceable acting of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is awful (this isn't aided by the atrocious script). The worst culprit is the villain Buntao the head of an Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I was laughing my head off as he was expressing his fury over having lost a bunch of money; horrid performance. Patrick Muldoon isn't much better and his it's a hostile takeover line (that's the remainder of the title of this film) was delivered about as badly as one could do it. There are no other main characters but no other actor/actress distinguished him/herself in this film. We next come to the plot. This should tell you all you need to know: In the original Rage and Honor Cynthia Rothrock who plays Chris Fairchild was a teacher in the inner city. Now she's a C.I.A. agent (or was it some other governmental agency--sorry but this film was so bad that I don't even remember). Hmmm...I can imagine what that C.I.A. application process was like. Interviewer: What past job experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; you're hired! I only give it a 2 because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end (though we know that Tommy (Muldoon) the secret villain will be caught). ",negative
" All right I recently got a chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus conquers the martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a spanish assignment in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it. I'll tell you usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food but not for this movie. Everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch was going to do next. Would Merlin help Santa Claus!?! or would his robot reindeer come and save the day? I would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever seen and I love it for that. :D ",negative
" First up this film according to the slick said it won best film at Worldfest Film festival in Houston Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. Wouldn't call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks is pretty much just as terrible as other Aussie B grader Body Melt but at least that film didn't look like it was shot on HI 8 video. My guess is the film makers watched a lot of Troma films and really bad B grade gore films thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film. Don't get me wrong I love really low grade films Just the fact that some of the characters put on fake American accents almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something. Really disappointing ending as well the showdown could have been way more exciting and some good fight scenes. You can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy Bad Taste with the whole car explosion rocket launcher and endless amount of people being gunned down yet the finale lacks any over the top humour or style like bad taste . If you like watching really bad gore films or are interested in no-budget film making watch it otherwise stay away. ",negative
" I gave this a four purely out of its historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on Showtime in the early nineties. Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act as a duo. Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers. I guess it had something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory. I vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy. Even the Stooge's seem to be going through the motions. Overall there's nothing much really to recommend here. If you're not a Stooge fan then don't bother. If you are a Stooge fan then stick with the shorts. ",negative
" Seeing this movie as I just did for the first time on Turner Classic (which lists it as Dangerous Female ) can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 Bogart-Astor version. Ricardo Cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk. I hope he remembered his dentist and his Brylcreem salesman in his will; they made him the actor he was. The women are all good but no better than that. Well Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the original Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set-changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake; here Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley(!) can't. This movie doesn't exactly stink; it lies there like a big slice of ham. Its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the '41 Falcon don't just happen. On the 1-to-10 scale I rate it a 4 mainly for the camera work and the supporting players. ",negative
" A young scientist Harry Harrison is continuing his late father's scientific research into limb regeneration with flying colours but his interferingly dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum. When he finds out there is an accident involving Harry losing an arm. So he tries out the serum and what eventuates is a genetically deranged arm that has a mind of its own. Oh we've seen this oh so many times before but what lifts this very campy and quite rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. Actually it's not a bad flick by Fangoria films; just there are better ones out there which are similar in vein. Servered Ties simply lacks it own distinctive style. The oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled Re-animator and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from Evil Dead 2 . The comic story is truly whacked out with it's black humour but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor. Surprises do crop up especially the flick's final outcome. Which is well accepted as I thought it could have copped out with something more accessible. For a low-budget production the FX makeup can look rigid and very goofy but there's some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe. Even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story thanks to Elke Sommer's sternly juicy performance as the mother. Oliver Reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well. They were both immensely diverting as the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as Harry. Director Damon Santostefano briskly paces the film and orchestrates some stylish scenes of gripping and bamboozling horror. Yeah it's juvenile and basically silly nonsense but you got to hand it to it for some undemanding entertainment. ",negative
" ** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Mia (Helin) is returning home from capital Stockholm to rural Rättvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla has divorced and moved a town away. Mia is still single and is focused on her career. There are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle. As the party goes on (and alcohol consumed) more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise... Comments: To be the work of a new writer/director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older Swedish comedy/dramas has been following for years. There are really no new elements or ideas. This movie draws upon three basic areas. 1) Embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves. 2) Sorrow and 3) Anxiety. This move has the focus on the last one almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along. No loss though since the humor that is there is not funny. The performances from the cast are good I guess though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten. I had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences but there were none. To conclude there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this. 3/10 ",negative
" This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that Freddy's Dead is. It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring pointless and nearly death free. The horrible 3-D ending and over-the-top CORNY kills are enough to drive this film into the ground. However it doesn't stop there just add bad acting a terrible script and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano! It's no wonder why Freddy as always played by Robert Englund has made two postmortem appearances. I would too if I went out like that. This is a strictly fans only movie don't stare at our shame.

" Ignoring (if possible) the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking (which seems to be mandatory in Australian government-funded films) the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance. That's a far as it goes. The rest is simply awful. The plot's overburdened with wow symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere. A gross example is the giant peach float obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory. It was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free but nevertheless irrelevant prop! The peach is given a cursory unexplained wash-down at one stage but that's where it ends. Similarly the contrived black spot road sign where Steph's parents were killed is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past but her escape to what? She's had a pretty good deal where she was especially considering her visual disability and the unending loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian. The Guinness' prize for corny melodrama however goes to the characterization of Alan. Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but rats on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi-national - hiss! hiss! As a supervisor Alan performs the boss' villainous dirty work. He implements redundancies until surprise surprise the whole plant is closed and Alan himself is left as a pathetic unemployed failure. No cliché-free zones here mate! Not only this but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you'd encounter. If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic don't ask about detail. What's the significance of the shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg? Why doesn't the hotel where the couple makes love eventually twig that someone's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and among other pandemoniums the sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion. Summing this movie up in one word: Avoid Avoid Avoid. ",negative
" A yawn-inducing snail-paced disappointment Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money. When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender  his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intents of her own sent to recover an item from the bank owner's safety deposit box that is stored within the bank and you have quite the three-way dilemma. Unfortunately all you get it set-up in the film and nothing pays off in the end. Denzel Washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen who are much better than the film itself. In fact Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high-caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless cutthroat villain of sorts. Clive Owen isn't given much to do besides brood and pose but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role. It's strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while he was creating this film. The most perplexing aspect of Inside Man however is how much unwarranted praise it has received. For a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre-summer blockbuster this one falls horribly flat. ",negative
" (aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON) *spoiler* This was a drive-in feature co-billed with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named Yanos Dalmar is seen on horseback riding off with his 'man-eating' dog behind him. The townsfolk already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down. The murders first began around the time Count Yanos' older brother Count Igor Dalmar was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident. Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) that Igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up. Yanos agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's charred corpse back to life. But of course Igor is still alive (although horribly burned) and stalking and killing the women in the village. We see his char-broiled face appear at various points in the film so we know he's still alive making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious. Igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with Yanos over Ivanna with the burning candles falling on to the same bed that Igor stumbles on to meeting yet another final char-broiled end. The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks quite grainy and bad. Other than an even scratchier trailer no other extras are included. Although it has a nice creepy Spanish castle and good atmospherics I found it to be fairly boring and predictable with no excitement or mystery whatsoever. 3 out of 10. ",negative
" John Carradine John Ireland and Faith Domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this Grade G horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion. For Carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in. With that magnificent sonorous voice of his Carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in. He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion who movie director John Ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film. It's even got a graveyard but with a missing occupant. Faith Domergue is Ireland's aging star and Carole Wells is the young ingenue. In the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already. The script is so incoherent I'm still trying to figure out the point. I won't waste any more gray matter on it. ",negative
" I do not fail to recognize Haneke's above-average film-making skills. For example I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However regarding the content of this film I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by Walter (I don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable; I mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on!). I mean D/s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something freakish or pathological; it isn't. In general films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times. So for me I feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn't it nearly embarrassing?) and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in D/s relationships (personal experience forums irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this).

" If this movie were any worse it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This nonsensical mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It has been a while since I have seen this steaming pile but I do remember that I wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved. How anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe. I give it one star because there is not a rating lower.

No one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it. ",negative
" As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists. We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie. The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. This movie is so bad I wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies section. Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth. ",negative
" This is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture aren't enough to make a good film. Sure the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of Los Angeles in the thirties--I especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel and the tram rising up the hillside--but in a sense this fine cinematography is self-defeating because it creates a mood that something's going to happen --and nothing does. The script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or trauma--and time after time not delivering. Not even delivering the (I assume) theme of the movie the characters' essential misfit. The lead actors both too pretty for their roles didn't convey any repression or agony and the script didn't expose us to any. Now Donald Sutherland? That's another story. His character was so well fashioned so perfectly played that I wanted the camera to follow him. ",negative

" This movie starts out with a certain amount of promise; but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. That this well-meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories. I found this movie average at best. Art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography. The acting was good and so was Eva van der Gucht's singing. ",negative
" I would have left the movie halfway through if I hadn't been with people who liked it. The movie is based on real incidents but it's so over the top it didn't feel real at all. I have some psychological background hang out with a lot of psychotherapists and have known seriously crazy people so it's not that I think people like this don't exist. But in the film the only characters who seemed consistently human were Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and the young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a wicked sense of fun). There were a few amusing moments but the overall tone of the movie was grim bizarre and nasty. What a waste of an outstanding cast! As I watched them go through their turns I just felt like I was watching an acting class. This was brought home during the credits when a couple of people were shown just sitting there not acting not talking. Those few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours. ",negative

" I realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic. That is the only positive thing I can say about this truly horrid adaptation. Have you read 'Wise Blood?' It's an amazing book. Flannery O'Connor wrote about the south as no one else has. She was a southerner herself a devout catholic and a remarkably gifted writer. In her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith doubt and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness. The characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south but I can assure you that such people do exist. Not only do they exist they are human beings with families feelings and concerns like anyone else. Flannery's intentions were so often misunderstood - she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots - she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called 'grace'...even in the most violent distressing and maddening of circumstances. To read 'Wise Blood' is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom. Finally it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions - our entire world view. None of this comes through in John Huston's 'Gilligan's Island'-like adaptation. None. It is a farce. A bad farce. The entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach. The acting is poor the southern accents are fake and insulting. The filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners. Ms. O'Connor's intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap amateur theatre. The soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and 'Clockwork Orange'-style cheeseball electronics that doesn't fit the story or even the MOVIE. I was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out. Truly truly terrible. As an aside I do not agree with Ms. O'Connor's religious views and while I was raised in the deep south years ago I made my way north and have not looked back. But the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals (like every other place on earth) and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive. If you're into being offended (which I am not) then this movie most DEFINITELY crosses the line. I don't like to talk crap about an artist's work - John Huston was a man that I did not know and I'm sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker to which his respected place in film history attests. My views are clearly skewed by having read (and loved) Flannery O'Connor's work. So I don't claim to be coming from any other perspective. Maybe as a stand-alone film it works for cinephiles. But for Flannery O'Connor fans - and I might add for self-respecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes - this movie is a waste of time. ",negative

And the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic 90-minute whine by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as host of the show. Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed-up millionaire life? Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life? (Obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) Did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network executive hounding him at every turn? This might have worked as the plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode but not as a full-length movie. However it was nice to see Rip Taylor Gene Gene and the Unknown Comic again (although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar routines). And as someone else has pointed out this is Phil Hartman's first significant movie part (even though it lasts only a minute). Note his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits which is the name he was born with. You can't miss his voice and facial expressions even though he's much thinner and younger than in the SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a tiny part; one of his first after leaving the soap world. ",negative
" Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He's known throughout the world as a globetrotting TV reporter. Less well-known but equally effortful are his exploits as a full-time philanderer. I saw `Vivre pour Vivre' dubbed in English with the title 'Live for Life.' Some life! Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life: one mistress on her way out one on her way in and the cheated wife at home. It helps that Robert is a glib liar. Among his most useful lies are `I'll call you tomorrow' and `My work took longer than planned.' He spends a lot of time and money on planes trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons. You wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants down. Some may find his life exciting but I thought it to be tedious. His companions including his wife Catherine are all attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful you wonder if he's enjoying all this. Adding to the tedium is considerable footage that doesn't further the plot. There are extended sections with no dialogue or French-only dialogue. We see documentaries of wars torture and troop training interspersed with the live action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal. Annie Girardot is the standout performer in this film. Hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I can't find fault with Yves Montand's performance of what was basically an amoral bum. I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouch's novel techniques. In a hotel room scene the camera pans around the room as Robert and his mistress argue. We catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room. In another scene set on a sleeping car of a train Robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower. Robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train. I sensed that his wife was also unable to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The cinematography of those scenes and of those in Amsterdam was superb. I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I've named the project FIFTY: 50 Notable Films Forgotten Within 50 Years. As best I can determine this film like the other forty-nine I've identified has not been on video telecast or distributed in the U.S. since its original release. In my opinion it is worthy of being made available again. ",negative
" This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce even though I liked the original cartoon. There's this one scene I remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are. It's atrocious. Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her until I read about the show recently. All in all it's miserably forgettable. The only okay thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure they call it... Nananana ninja... ",negative
" I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say partly because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category. This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film Howl's Moving Castle . An intriguing premise is set up but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it. The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on things go down hill. The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly-veiled eco-propaganda and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of Japanese animated films. Overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators. What is left is something which is visually stunning (although sadly the version I saw was an Nth-generation copy with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying) but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused.

" There was a reasonably good looking girl starring the film(Zoe Mclellan) but even her looks couldn't stop me from voting it the lowest possible - one. The plot is bad and irrational. What more can I say. The movie sucks. ",negative
" This film has a weak plot weak characterization and really weak special effects that I question why I lost valuable life by watching it. It has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film. The robots are sad and the main hero 'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch. If this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable but there's nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters and he is killed. It's sad when you root for the bad guy because he's the best one to cheer for. When all is said and done this movie was better left on the cutting room floor or never funded at all. ",negative
" Some illegal so-called asylum seeker comes to Stuttgart and finds that Germans are racist. This is just another already-forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post-WWII anti-German propaganda films aimed to make Germans feel bad for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase German blonds and sell drugs to German teenagers. If you're looking for good German films in General see Der Tunnel Der Untergang Europa Europa and Lola rennt. But not this. Also Das Experiment with the same male actor from Lola rennt.  ",negative
" I´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by. I expected something better from Uma Thurman which was the reason I suffered my way through this experience in the first place. An awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality.

" An obvious b-grade effort to cash in on the Hostel/Saw buzz my expectations for this film were low (really low!) and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level. The acting is so bad it's not even funny the plot-line is non-existent and the only scare was realizing that I had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. The 34th is possibly the directors mother? - although I'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2! DVD extras include an hour long making of feature. Which raises the question Why? (although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do!). Avoid at all costs. ",negative
" When I was at the movie store the other day I passed up Blonde and Blonder but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean I'm sure most people bashed Romy and Michelle before they saw it Blonde and Blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up. But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson wow I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20's not their 40's. The story was just plain bad and obnoxious. Dee and Dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes. They are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think they're just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls. Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary. Would I ever recommend this? Not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex kittens it's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell. 1/10 ",negative
" Man this movie sucked big time! I didn't even manage to see the hole thing (my girlfriend did though). Really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh (woman to werewolf) strange clips the list goes on and on. Don't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie? And I don't mean all the naked ladys... It's something about the light or something... This could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because it's an original movie white a nice plot twist. My final words are: Don't see it! It's not worth the time. If you wanna see it because the nakedness there's lots of better ones to see! ",negative
" That might be a bit harsh for me saying that but sadly so far in his directing career its true. Just have a look at what he as done so far. They barely make it past the 3 star mark. Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this movie her performance carries the whole movie. I do hope she gets a blockbuster and breaks into the bigger league of actors she clearly has the skills. Greg was not so impressive typical TV acting style. The movie is oddly categorized as a horror. The only horror is short flashbacks and they last a max of 2-5 seconds with a little blood in them. I personally would call this more a drama/thriller . But no matter how interesting the story actually is bad directing editing and acting (appart from Lucy) destroys it. You get no real connection to the actors something which is very important in a story like this one. You just sit there watching feeling nothing. Its like watching a bad TV soap....actually I think the TV soap would be more interesting. My advice: Stay away from this movie...or better yet just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with. ",negative
" Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie had been set in the 60's ;like the book was. And I really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption..... I'm glad that maybe someone might be influenced to read the books..... but The Man With Red Eyes interchangeable as IT? And what's up with the volcanic upheaval? Where was THAT in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us!!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was European version of this film. I sure wish I could id it. I can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption. This movie needs to be X'd. ",negative
" Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish of a film. For starters the script was definitely written to be made into a B-film but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television) and Hutton (looking for the two of a one-two punch he had hoped would define his career after Ordinary People ) became attached to the picture. Cheesy lines big bad wipes from scene to scene (Come on--who uses wipes after 12th Grade Telecommunications class?) and plain old bad acting sink this film. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I must admit feeling Duchovny's pain as he read the lines that are the voice-over. While I found myself laughing when I'm sure the director wanted me to feel terrified nothing prepared me for the closing line of Duchonvey's voice-over: if you ever need a doctor be sure to call 911. If only the studio had called 911 this dog of a motion picture would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. ",negative
" this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed. the effects were pretty good- i hear it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money. i rented it so i won't complain too much about what i paid but it was a couple hours that i'll never get back. plot holes abound. terrible acting all across the board. i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie life is too short. if your friends want to watch this run away. i can't stress enough how bad this film was. where the hell did the second dragon come from? why didn't he show up sooner? how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago?

" had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsy-fartsy toss-together with no direction or resolution. how do these people get through film school? who gives them money to make this crap? could have been so much more fine lead actor and i always like Fairuza Balk but come on the alt-rock metaphor of just staring vacantly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired and it sure doesn't make for good films. the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say. this is like the throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall school of art-making just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges. that can work if the director actually has any kind of vision or has a brain that knows when it's in the presence of potential but here it's just space filler of no consequence. i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit and was yelling you lazy bastard at the screen when the credits popped up.

" Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (not even live there) and those actors need to find another job. The most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life... and I only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did not. Even at the end the credits gave me anxiety. I guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly. This movie is definitely a great How Not To Make a Movie guide. Too bad I can't give a 0.

" Okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did. Someone somewhere was an idiot. I want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on. The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does (my Popular Mechanics flying-car gearhead blood still runs strong) and the 3D was pretty effective. The CG wasn't Pixar-quality but it was generally good. The flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics with some half-assed late-60s characters thrown in for colour (hippie flies African-American flies with giant afros and black shades etc.) and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads (although they made suitably gross squelching noises). The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework relying on offensive and outdated clichés (60s gender politics including mostly-useless female characters racial stereotypes evil Russians a fat fly who only wants to eat grade-two level gross-out humour). In a movie aimed for IMAX they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right (zero-g in the Lunar Module during landing burn? PLEASE.) They couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts all of which is in the public domain; instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crap. But we liked the maggots. So they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots. Uh yay. 1.5/5. ",negative
" i know you've read that before on countless other films no doubt if you're reading the comments here but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i've been able to track down. no doubt the really bad ones aren't even available to buy or watch on tv but even so i feel it's fair to qualify that i'm not just some dumb renter who picked badly. i've seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked films here on the imdb and i'm ticking of the remaining ones with every chance. most of those stand head and shoulders above this... excersize in absolute monotony. i like to rate truly bad films (as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are) by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through. if you can watch it by yourself it isn't that bad. if you can watch it with one single friend... it's bad but could be a lot worse. it took 5 of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy. and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films (spotting the boom mic for example 3 times in this one if i'm not mistaken) could take away the dry taste in my mouth. yes i'd watched it but i'd also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end. i hope and pray we saw the directors cut... to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me. so much of the film centers around this. i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but it isn't a good film. the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money (considering inflation) and was an utter gem. it's not an excuse for how bad this baby is. spoilers ahead... it's not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters... the pacing of the film... is insane... nothing... is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging. no matter what your alignment or sex... rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time. the acting is cheese... but not overly amatuer... i've seen a lot worse in better films... but somehow it's the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you'll ever hear in a film that really grates. rent this if like me you have a fascination with the worst of the worst and only if you're going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it. this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair. it's an endurance test you probably want to skip. i'm sure there is worse... but i wouldn't be surprised if it has decoteau's name on it.

" with a title like this you know not to expect a great horror movie. But this was really bad even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: an escaped criminal wears a Halloween mask so everyone around him thinks he's someone else. this joke might actually work for 5 or 10 minutes but not during the entire movie ! the actors are not that bad but their characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and downright stupid. No suspense no excitement and little gore (very cheap). Satan's Little Helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically at that. It became so boring towards the end that I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I couldn't care whatever happened. Amanda Plummer was great in Pulp Fiction but come on.. that was 13 years ago and she hasn't done anything decent after that. So no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of crap.. Avoid or be warned.. ",negative
" After spotting the high rating on IMDb I decided to go see this movie. Beyond that high rating I intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews. I wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations. Given my rating you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room I was ready for some scary stuff. First chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts in a believable manner. He's freaked out. I'm encouraged and think to myself this is going to be good. The people who made this movie understand that less is more. But it's what happens next that was a big let down. The subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach... Just blast the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works. Let's see a clock radio that turns on by itself? Good that's always scary. Objects that move around in the room? Good you can't complain about that. Blood dripping from the walls and sink? Great. Ghosts that commit suicide? Good. Anything else? How about loud noises shaking fire more shaking messing up the room more blood etc etc. It's all good. And it's all been done before. Overstimulate our Attention Deficit Disordered audience with all kinds of stuff in quick succession and they won't be able to look away. Well it didn't work for me. And you know what else? When I go see a horror movie in a theater it's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments. But this movie had no scary moments. The audience was silent and disinterested. I felt no chill down my spine. Nothing. The Shining was 100x what this movie tries to be. So who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry I just don't get it. ",negative
" The two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities. First Daphne Zuniga in her first appearance in a film young and supple with looks that still encompass her body today steals the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that. She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects. Second the score by then known composer Christopher(Chris) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star...yeah I know one star more is not much but in this movie's case it is a lot. The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah blah...we all know where this is going.

" I've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time this one however takes the cake. More comedy than horror Full Moon High puts the c in cheese-fest. The star quality in this movie is not bad. Just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony an all-American high school football player of the 50's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violin player. He drove everyone batty! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met his end of his own bullet. Adam's father Alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game. After all these years Tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack and then he'll get the chance to catch in his state.

" Where to begin? How best to describe just how awful this movie is??? Let's start with the campy hick humor. It isn't very funny. Add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Pity poor Art Carney who should have known better than to do this movie. And then there is the plot. A roadie whose life goal is to work an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want... And then just when the movie should end they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well I won't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie. There are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a B movie or perhaps worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. That's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good. If nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor. Let's just say this. This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. And none are worse than Roadie. ",negative
" Depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this Christmas Evil can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly lame holiday-themed slashers ever made. Me personally I'm tempted to opt for the latter because I didn't bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early 80's slasher with a nutcase in a Santa Clause costume butchering people. Wrong! The movie actually handles about a bloke named Harry Stadling; who's obsessed with Christmas works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment. Harry's issues all started when he witnessed Santa  his daddy in a costume obviously  caress his mommy's naked legs at a tenderly young age. After that he just developed into a social outcast much to the irritation of his younger brother who's bound to snap one (holi)day. I fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie but did it really have to be so boring? There are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed but this movie doesn't even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists (with the notable exception of the finale I must admit). Also I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children! He doesn't and exclusively kills misbehaving adults. How are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original Christmas thriller serious when Santa doesn't even commit one miserable child murder? THAT would have made Christmas Evil a classic whereas now it's just a forgettable and pitiable piece of junk. ",negative
" The acting other reviews notwithstanding was remarkably well-done. Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying obnoxious Austrian climber quite well. Other acting is fine. The story could have been riveting but somehow it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown and so the story which could have been quite dramatic fails to draw in this audience. Beautiful scenery and cinematography a remarkably dramatic true story important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not try as I might involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation) I expected to *love* this flick - and yet it left me cold. It could be a failing within myself but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction scriptwriting production editing - somehow they lost me. It's a shame because it could have been wonderful. Good acting dramatic story beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn't. Probably worth watching just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as I was. Mostly it bored me. ",negative
" Times are tough for Angel Town gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown (Mainly due to embarrassing writing) the gangs want a street kid Martine to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday. However due to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier World's lamest actor Gruner) named Jacques hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made (And I've seen my share) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need are French kick-boxers who can't act. Worst of all there are so many awkward moments it's just truly hilarious. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: You like the fighting? (Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock) I could kill him right? When I want him dead he dies! The reason why I don't want him dead is because i'm afraid of him and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me that's why he doesn't die! Of course the fact that it's wrong to kill someone let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation. Odd. However don't let me make this sound that I hated this movie far from it it's so terrible it's priceless. The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang-members who (the film's biggest logic gap)decline the use of pistols. Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while Gruner kick-boxes the rest. All of this set to the sound of horrible Mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this. The other treat about this movie is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that's the main reason he's here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend (In a graveyard in the film's awkward beginning) Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand make sure to down tequila like the laughable opening song details Ain't no mercy in Angel Town * out of 4-(Bad) ",negative
" I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time and it was even more boring than when I first watched it. I don't understand why it has become such a 'cult classic' when it is so tediously dull. The opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life. After this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut. The makeup is quite good and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open. There's not much to wet yourself over though most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening. There isn't much gore at least in the Vipco DVD I watched. No The Incredible Melting Man is not that great at all. I'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it. If you want a TRUE sci-fi/horror cult classic watch The Deadly Spawn instead!

" The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman Sam Arkoff Lloyd Kaufman etc. as kings of the B's. Because the folks at Crown International were so key they haven't been elevated to the status they richly deserve. A film like THE VAN may now seem like a disposable piece of Drive-in esoteria but it was a sizable hit when it was released (not to mention subsequent re-releases as a double feature with other Crown hits). THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown's hit strategy of seizing upon the mood of movie-goers at the time of a film's release. Here it was sex drugs rock 'n roll and the brief Custom Van fad. As others have noted it is ironic that the hit song in the film refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the film itself. I had a town Selectman where I was at the time even declare these vans to be dens of sin on wheels! A perfect ad line for the film! There are the usual assortment of good and bad girls muscle-heads and low-brow hijinks (including a supporting bit by Danny DeVito). In many ways this isn't much different from the old Beach Party movies of the 60's but now spiced up with Nudity and Drug use. Obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule the film coasts along pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some by today's standards certainly un-PC views of women. The classic touch is a Toaster for Bobby's den of sin on wheels. Yes a Toaster! Hey you gotta have something hot for those munchies! Grindhouse Fest. ",negative
" Let me start by stating that I usually do like Renny Harlin's directing style for the most part and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots. Unlike Harlin's Elm Street 4 and Die Hard 2 which I really liked there is something that is missing from this movie. That my friends is a script. The dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity. There are so many awful lines in this movie I don't even want to have to remember any of them. Not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure. It's almost like Harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said they could improve the script. Wrong again. The sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue. Stallone has never been a favorite of mine but when he is acting circles around Lithgow Turner and the worst of the bunch Rooker there is something wrong with this picture. Lithgow played one of the best villains in Ricochet yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here. How is that possible? I've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by Stallone who himself still phoned-in his performance. Turner's part is so small and pointless but she still manages to appear lost on screen. Michael Rooker CAN act. I know this because I have witnessed it in Days of Thunder but he seems like he is READING his lines from cue cards. Has it come to this? When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking I just wanted the movie to end right there or have them both amazingly find their acting ability. Unfortunately neither of those things occurred. Which brings me back to Harlin who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters. It's his fault that I was never drawn into this movie at all because he should have made the people actually act. The script is not very good but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director. I don't care how much was paid for the special effects which for the most part are good you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting. Plus the pacing of this movie seems to be off. The opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all. I mean I understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene but I really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene. If the bad guy's would have won early maybe I wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever! ",negative
" Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan. He also happens to be a highly-qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around Kabul operating on wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards. He is then finally promoted to sergeant but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career so he quits from the Army altogether. One year later frustrated with civilian life he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform. ",negative
" I watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity. The first few scenes alone were hilarious. I won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it I wouldn't want to ruin the laughs. Needless to say the entire time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing. Towards the end we all got bored however as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off. There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting. The characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten Learn to Read book. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting. ",negative
" I noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults. It probably earned some of them but it wasn't that bad. Well I'll be honest: I never want to see this film again. It was a bad film. But I don't hate this film it tried to tell a story. As a drama this film could work very well actually. I just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this (they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite it could have been a great film. But as a satire it didn't work in its current form -- many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot: for example the robbery scene makes little sense in the story. Still it wasn't the worst independent film ever made -- is it in the Top 10 Worst? That's debatable. ",negative
" Only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less than impressed with this film. In this sequel Cruella DeVil(by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away. From that point we only wait until she starts having crises. Soon enough she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close I found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny. That is fair enough as its target market is I assume children under 12. Quite a good entertainment for children and families but didn't do much for me. * out of ***** ",negative
" Ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee Is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember him he was from the movie Dragon The Bruce Lee Story.') Jason London is funny as Luke the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal Dracula's body from the slab. Diane Neal Is good as the woman who steals Dracula's body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend And Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Giving a better performance than Gerard Butler did the count in the original film. Roy Scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie and he does a decent job as the mentor of Jason Scott Lee's character. This is the second sequel in the trilogy and they are off to a good start. It's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note. ",negative
" The motion picture was in all likelihood made in the year 1930 and released in 1931. I would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era. Nevertheless this particular Zane Grey plot appears to be very weak. Also Gary Cooper was probably just learning to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards. For 1931 maybe. For 2004 not acceptable. Some of the actors performed well. Sadly the Indians always get the short end in these early westerns. They were living on the land long before the white man came but according to twisted history they had no right to defend themselves. ",negative

" Another double noir on one disc from Warner Home Video and by far the better of the two movies is RKO's marvellous 1950 thriller Where Danger Loves . This is a memorable classic with a great cast in Robert Mitchum Faith Domergue and Claude Rains. Crisply photographed in Black & White by Nicholas Musuraca it was tightly directed by John Farrow. Where Danger Lives is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was Hollywood's past - (See my full review). Unfortunately none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc the abysmal MGM 1949 stinker TENSION! Poorly written (Allen Rivkin) and directed by John Berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations. The inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist - blandly played by Richard Baseheart - and his overtly floozy wife (a risible Audrey Totter) is totally implausible and unconvincing (how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody's guess). Then when she unsurprisingly ditches him for one of her playmates (Lloyd Gough) our timid pharmacist instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune plots revenge and attempts to kill Gough but at the last minute chickens out. The guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by Homicide detective Barry Sullivan (another bland performance). So who did kill him? Well at this stage of the movie you really couldn't care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director Berry. Mr. Berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing. There is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off! The only TENSION contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of Barry Sullivan as he gives the intro at the film's opening. So much for that! A most unfortunate effort! C'est La Vie! Best things about this turkey is the smooth Monochrome Cinematography by the great Harry Stradling an effective score by a young Andre Previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely Cyd Charisse before she found her dancing shoes. Hey! - maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes! HUH? In its favour however are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers commentaries and featurettes for both films. But the disc is worth it alone for the RKO Mitchum classic!

" ... You can't exactly shove her out of the way because she's old; and if you were being charitable you might say that the ponderous gait she ambles along with isn't really her fault. Nevertheless in these circumstances it's often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake. So it is with The Pallbearer an attempt to do something 'different' with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all wrong; sort of like showing off your 'breakdancing' skills at a grandparent's funeral. To further extend the metaphor (perhaps unwisely!); like the old lady one starts to feel with the set-up of the film that its demise cannot be far away. Sure enough this particular 'death' is agonizingly protracted slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction: Downhill. Its laboured attempts at 'humour' can be seen coming a mile off - again not unlike the grim inevitability of death! Returning once again to the image of 'dragging heels' the main character Tom is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life. If there are indeed degrees of 'pathetic' then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of Schwimmer's other - more famous - role. To find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even MORE 'clueless' than Ross is certainly a tough ask even for as 'able' a comic performer as Schwimmer but I guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously 'echoing' situations in the first place. How will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he's picking scripts where the characters could almost be 'interchangeable' even if the situations aren't? A man with a longstanding high-school crush on someone he hasn't seen for years. Sound familiar... ? Paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her 'Rachel' role but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable DIFFERENCES present weren't so incongruous as well. Unfortunately the romantic element is so well-worn it's threadbare and the 'backdrop' is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a 'stiff'... ! 2/10.

" Nu Image UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million. Some feature extensive effects work others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million. Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $750 000 if not considerably less than that. Few sets are utilized a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish. It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is poorly directed poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget. Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by P.T. Barnum. ",negative
" (this may be a bit on the spoilerish side) I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed. That of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie. A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago. It's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults. Plus it's got built in quality sequels. But Disney-fying was not the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book. It is a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely psychic because that was the easiest way of explaining it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W's as added tension there is enough tension in the story without that. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses... that deprived us of what could've been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book. I could nitpick for days about little things but I also think larger things like the art direction was a off. Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look with its strangely darkened skies. The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like earth. It has people on it that look like humans. The skies are blue the grass is green and there are children playing. But something is a little bit off. The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie. The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth that is if we forget how to love. It would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm. I unfortunately did not watch the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as well. Overall an artistic disappointment. ",negative
" Cash (Now played by Khrystyne Haje in for Angelina Jolie) has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland (after her protector has died from old age said protector was played by Elias Koteas an actual decent actor) and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash. She leads a group of burned out cyborgs (That includes William Katt Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature. The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as McDowell Katt and Galligan are given little to do. Haje is indeed a whiny heroine and Lynch is too over the top(as usual) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun-bad as it's hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme the second one is just dull.) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has. As an action flick this is routine and by the numbers B-movie stuff and it is competently made that's the only thing positive I can say about it. *1/2 out of 4-(Poor) ",negative
" Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time and like that earlier film it has little resemblance to Burroughs' literary character. But while the 1932 Tarzan was reduced to Tarzan - Jane speech this Tarzan played by Miles O'Keeffe doesn't speak or even grunt. He does do the the Tarzan yell a couple of times which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film. No Tarzan plays second banana to Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather as third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast. This movie has no point but to show Derek naked. The two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad. More evidence that no one cared. Bizarrely enough Tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film. Maybe he car pooled in from Sumatra with the Indian elephants that are also on display. ",negative

He's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show. This is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years no joke. The story lines are both poorly written and executed. The jokes are as bad as the ones on Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not dislike this show more it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title even worse.

" Unbelievably bad acting a no good unclear story and flashy images and slow-motions where they are needed the least: Adrenaline is everything a movie should not be. Georgina Verbaan (a so-and-so dutch soap actress who hasn't attended her English classes) plays rich girl Freya who has the habit of 'thrill-seeking'. Which basicly is doing dangerous stunts break stuff and annoy people. And not in a fun Jackass way. Then there's Dracko (Rivas). He kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there's Freya's dad (Lockyer) who plays a dubious role as well. And in the end we got Jason (debutant Fyall) the boyfriend of Freya. One day Freya gets disappeared and everybody seems involved but we the viewer really don't care as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable and the story doesn't make any sense. Why was this even made? 2/10. ",negative
" Let me be really clear about this movie. I didn't watch this movie because of the plot I watch it for the saucy sex scenes. That being said this movie is so god damn awful I flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot. Spoiler Alert The first scene of the movie already had me cringing.. you see a woman painting something by the lakeside in pure bliss and serene then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her. When they both finished they show each other what they had done... and the woman painted A VINEYARD WHEN SHE IS FACING INFRONT OF THE LAKE. What kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake?? And in another scene Traci gets to kill her teacher's lover by smash him with the sail pole and then she swims away and none of the town's police suspected her once. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DID NOT WEAR A GLOVE DID SHE? HER FINGER PRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE GOD DAMN BOAT!! After that it gets worst whenever Mandy is around there is the chilling sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit. It's also a real pity Rosanna Arquette's is in this movie. I feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft-porn no brainer. Same goes for Jürgen Prochnow who also has the misfortune to star in this movie. All in all 2/10. ",negative
" I saw this film when it first came out in 1978 when I was a sophomore in high school. I took a date to see it. I didn't get any needless to say because the film was so bad! Joan Rivers' career never tanked as badly as it deserved after making this awful unfunny crap. In fact unfunny isn't a severe enough term: this film is ANTI-FUNNY! You walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen. This isn't worth watching out of curiosity or out of any sense of it being so-bad-it's-good. Not even the gang at MST3K could've made this worth watching!

" Believe me I wanted to like Spirit . The idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old-fashioned hand-drawn animation again as if the last pencil-animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete had got my blood up ... but then the insulting flavourless banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of Spirit got my blood up even more. The character designs are generic the animation (partly as a result) merely competent the art direction as a whole so utterly boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about (we know from The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El-Dorado that there are talented artists at Dreamworks) and the sophisticated use of CGI is in every single instance ill-judged. (Why do they bother?) There's not a single thing worth LOOKING at. In an animated cartoon this is fatal. But it gets worse... The horses can't talk but they're far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in Bambi which can. And it seems that in a way the horses CAN talk. Spirit himself delivers the prologue (sounding for all the world like a 21st-Century actor picked out of a shopping mall in California) and from then on his laid-back decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack although it never once tells us anything that we didn't already know or expresses a feeling which the artwork poor though it is wasn't capable of expressing twice as well. That prologue by the way: (a) contains information which Spirit we later discover had know way of knowing; (b) expresses ideas which Spirit would lack the power to express even if he COULD talk; (c) includes new age rubbish like This story may not be true but it's what I remember ; and (d) will give countless children (the production is pitched I presume at six-year-olds) the impression that horses are native to North America which is sort of true in that the common ancestor of domestic horses zebras etc. WAS native to North America - but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived and the mustangs of Spirit's herd (which allegedly belong here like the buffalo grass ) were descended from horses introduced by Europeans. So the prologue rather annoyed me. As often as Spirit talks Bryan Adams sings sounding as usual as though he's got a bad throat infection - and it's not THAT he sings or even HOW he sings it's WHAT he sings: maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less if possible than Spirit's spoken narrative and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune (although I was paying close attention and was able to discern that they probably didn't). If only Bryan Adams and the guy-pretending-to-be-a-horse could have SHUT UP for a minute or two the movie might have been allowed to take its true form: mediocre and derivative rather than jaw-droppingly bad.

" As it is often the case the impressive and explosive trailers of Asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories. Similar to Unleashed (which was great ) Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding. The main characters an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. In fact by the end you lose track of who you're supposed to empathize with failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men  whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide. Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability by the half-way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge. The suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling. And in the end you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary. On the plus side the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to US movies  so those who aren't familiar with Asian films and are tired of Hollywood's predictability should check it out. The white balance seemed off throughout most of the film. It was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one but it strained my eyes. The movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you  an interesting build-up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget low speed chase scene. And just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of Shakespearean tragedy you realize that it's not an ending at all but rather a transition into a wacky country-music montage about peace and serenity. Throw in some grisly from-behind choke scenes a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way Asians' fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didn't match the film and you get the average bland Asian thriller. I just don't get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions I thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs? Ultimately in the end we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us  tetanus. 4/10 ",negative
" This movie really i mean REALLY sucks. Its got plot holes so big and 30 foot dragon can fit through them. Not to mention the dragon itself which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real. I mean when you see something like this you gotta be thinking Wow someone actually made this movie. Then released it. That takes guts . Whoever they are i'm sure they don't work in the film business anymore. When i hired this movie it wasn't in on DVD so i (reluctantly) took it out on video. The first thing to appear was a Lord of the Rings trailer for the Two Towers. This was a very clever move putting this trailer on the video. It justifies me (reluctantly) giving the film 1 star otherwise i would have given it zero stars. Maybe the producers though the star attraction of Dean Cain (I think thats how you spell it) would draw in the crowds (uh to the video store that is). Next they employed split screen technique (like in Hulk) to (i assume) compensate for what an atrocity this piece of crap film is. On the box cover we see a picture of our hero and the dragon. Does the dragon look exactly like the one in Dragonheart or is it just me? Either way the dragon in the film looks like a reject from Gremlins 2 and has the CGI of a Nintendo video game villain from the early 90's (perhaps worse). Also not the Dragons movement as it pursues its victims- its the same F##cking monotonous movement- right leg left leg right leg left leg- dom dom dom dom DOM DOM F#$king DOOOOOM! This just pisses me off. Maybe the filmmakers thought this was thrilling and would have the same effect of Jaws. Why not then have a Dragon POV shot. Either way that was just funny much like watching a Weebl toon. Dean Cain gives many puzzled looks during the film (maybe his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career). Don't expect Superman here. The first time i saw the trailer for this film i thought it was an add for a PS2 game. As for the story its so so bad my 5 year old brother can come up with better ones when he's unconvincingly trying to lie about why he was messing around in my room while i wasn't there. Oh and did i mention that I F@#KING HATE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS INCREDIBLY STUPID STUPID CRAP ATROCIOUS FILM?!!! ",negative
" This film is one giant pant load. Paul Schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay. And his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process. The worst though is Woody Harrelson whom I ordinarily like when he's properly cast. He plays the walker a homosexual man in D.C. who plays social companion to the bored wives of the Washington elite. He couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. His southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and humidity of the South is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has. It is monotonous. But his is not the worst accent in the movie. His boyfriend played by Moritz Bleibtreau attempts to affect some kind of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. He is incapable of rolling his r's in spite of the fact that in real life he is German and speaks several languages - one of them being Italian! That's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think? From the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact. In fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film. Ufortunately no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws. If you like these three actresses watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time. ",negative

" We see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl but whatever he tries they won't stay open. After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So is she back from the grave seeking revenge? Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well that's what I hoping I could say. And 'hoping' was as good as it got. This is an forgettable so-so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before but I went in thinking it was my first viewing. So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things but like I said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. Nightmare' is just another type of it's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel. Oh please give me something that's a bit more fresh. It doesn't have to be entirely original but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired J-horror flick. Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking vengeful chick spirit. But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old same old story and jolts. This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood-curdling experience but really when it's not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut-eye. That might be harsh but it just didn't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self-centred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous. The film's haunting ending is a high point though. The film looks fine although it could have done without the snazzy quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. The performances tread a fine line but Gyu-ri Kim is strong in the lead role. It's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills. Although I found the handling of it rather lethargic despite the odd effective chills. A standard effort all round I guess but still it's equally missable. ",negative
" Another case of a decent DVD case betraying the shot-on-video quality of the film. It wasn't that bad. Rochon does a serviceable job and Damn! the cast is good looking. I've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis. This movie really wanted to make you think Rochon was the killer but it was not to be. My biggest problem with the film was that by the end I didn't much care who was the killer and the real killer made little sense since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha betcha didn't see that one coming sucker!'. Yeah there were continuity errors about (mainly with ms. Rochon's ever-changing wardrobe) but for an indie slasher it's not that bad. I was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless but that was just a gimmick. The dialog was overly think and painful at times. Just don't have high expectations going into this and it won't be that bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated. ",negative
" I am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators. To me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main character's internal turmoil does not work at all (in Vonnegut's book Slaughterhouse Five and even in George Roy Hill's adaptation for the screen it does). Credibility is often overstretched. Too many questions are left open. Did I miss some central points? Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots? A boy called Campbell Jr. grows up in upstate New York. At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book. It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it. The boy leafs through the book his dad doesn't like his doing that. What should this tell me? The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin. BANG. It is 1938 the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright. What kind of plays does he write? In what language? Is he successful? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous. The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same. He does not. Why? Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American? Because he is successful? Because his wife is? Because he likes his life there? Because he likes the Nazis? Because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change? Don't ask me. Possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist. He states that he is deeply in love with his wife. He speaks of his Republic of Two (meaning he and his wife). There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a Republic of One. On the request of an American agent Campbell Jr. agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines. The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast. So now we have Campbell Jr. presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American. The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when Campbell Jr. really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc. (must have scrambled the messages terribly). Anyway the Nazis lose the wife dies (touring in the Crimean for German troops - I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II) Campbell Jr. says he goes to the Russian front but does not go is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug (how come?) is dragged to a sight-seeing tour in Auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New York. AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS BANG. From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster. It is 1961 Campbell Jr. lives in New York tenement as a has-been and mourns the loss of his wife. Nobody really cares - or do they? Yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. Auschwitz survivors. A painter. Some American supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead. They even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife? Anyway in the end Campbell Jr. calls in at the Israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmann's. He writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriter's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit. While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone. So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss. Amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American. I assume according to them this took a lot of courage. As a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment Campbell created for himself a win-win situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war. The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story. One might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything. But even then it fails to make a point primarily I suspect because the love affair in the Republic of Two falls completely flat. This is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by Sheryl Lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress. She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent. Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts (confession broadcast and hidden messages) but I guess this is largely unfilmable. Maybe I should give the book a chance. ",negative
" Did anyone read the script. This has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year. Three great actors Paul Giamatti Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson couldn't pull this one out. About two-thirds it looked like Giamatti eyes were saying I can't believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I ever saw but it's on the really really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines but what else can be said? Okay the movie just doesn't move with Vaughn's con-man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past. It was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into. ",negative
" Kevin Spacey is very talented but unfortunately directing is not his forte. I had high expectations about the film before I rented it and maybe that is why I disliked it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting but it's not the attempt that counts. I found the film dull boring and stretched out. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better especially since he is conscious in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing but this was one of his first films (I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked). The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. However that shot was very Usual Suspects ish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his (which is very good mind you). If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting watch Hitchcock's Lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this. ",negative
" How this film could miss so many of the fascinating complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable. An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot ankle-deep characterisation/motivation and a really awful soundtrack (replacing tension with vast swathes of noise replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars. Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely plastered on over the cracks... Dreadful. In a world where gormless brain-dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job (a tear appears) Get Carter (sobs uncontrollably) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently this one takes the proverbial biscuit. Execrable nonsense. How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder... Rubbish. ",negative
" I read a couple of good reviews on this board for Mr. Scarface but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself the picture will probably make very little sense. Indeed after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of Rick's (Al Cliver) character. The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli) but as most other viewers commented he's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's goons who chased Tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them. For all of his buildup as the title character Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale making the U.S. working title Mr. Scarface rather moot. I've seen enough spaghetti Westerns to know that they don't all work; I guess in this case my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn't quite make it either. ",negative
" The movie started off strong LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover police officer with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from the Practice possibly miscast as a bad guy?) committing robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman Spacey et al) are well cast and the movie shows promise. The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake I would choose the former. Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I would have thought he would put on a better show given the fact that he has been acting talented for years. Everything he did in this film was unconvincing. Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films. Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent. That aside there are a few plot holes such as Pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery. This movie had so much promise. Thoroughly disappointing. ",negative
" La Furia del Hombre Lobo forms a completely stand-alone storyline which doesn't seem to fit in at all with the previous Waldemar Daninsky movies. Some have commented that this movie is supposed to take place before the events of Werewolf Shadow although it was released afterwards ... they may be right I'm not sure. Anyway in this movie Waldemar Daninsky is bitten by a yeti-like creature in Tibet (great dialogue here -- It was a yeti. But that's impossible. I'm a scientist and these things don't exist. It was a hallucination. That's all. ) and although marked with the sign of the pentagram he is able to prevent the change into a werewolf until he discovers that his wife has been cheating on him. Changing into the beast one night he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being electrocuted. It's not long before he's resurrected by a dominatrix university professor who is conducting some kind of unfathomable experiments with mind control. He is taken to the underground cellar of a castle where the subjects of these experiments live like chained animals. First of all -- Jacinto Molina Paul Naschy whatever you want to call him he's a fine actor and cared passionately about his work. No matter how flawed these movies are you can always rely on him for a decent performance. The rest of the cast seem good enough but it's hard to tell when they have a half-assed voice-over dubbed over all their lines. And that was really the main problem for me ... many of the voice-over artists they used were just awful awful awful. Whenever I chuckled during the movie it was at the inept way that they delivered their lines (they seem to constantly refer to the hero as Waldeman ). But unfortunately it's almost impossible to find subtitled copies of Naschy movies although they're sometimes available in the original language without subtitles. The directing of Jose Maria Zabalza seems sort of hit-and-miss ... there are some great visual ideas in some scenes while others are badly constructed and poorly edited particularly in the final scenes when it really counts. The reason for this was that Zabalza was apparently drunk most of the time while on set. He allowed his fourteen year old nephew to rewrite Molina's dialogue used extras without his permission and spliced several shots from Molina's earlier movies. All of this pretty much ruined any chance this movie had of being one of Molina's best works and it's no surprise that the two of them never worked together again. But it's not all bad news as there are some good ideas here. Some aspects of the storyline make an interesting psychological drama with the werewolf as a metaphor for jealousy and rage. The 'werewolf as a yeti' idea is one that returned in Molina's later work. Some pretty horrific and surreal stuff goes on down in the cellar and there's also a very memorable sequence about half way through the film where Daninsky runs from house to house through a village slaughtering or molesting innocents as he goes -- one scene is particularly intense but it's actually lifted straight from Molina's first movie La Marca del Hombre-lobo along with a few other shots. I actually found the movie on the whole to be very entertaining although there are some problems with the Front Row Entertainment version such as pretty obvious cuts (although some of it may simply be due to the director's lack of continuity). Gods knows what omissions there are -- I'll probably try to get my hands on the uncut version at some stage in the future. This is a overall a decent piece of vintage Naschy which experienced fans might enjoy but it could have been much better and so probably wouldn't make a great introduction. ",negative
" My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here. ",negative
" This film is not deserved of the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it but I know many people like myself rely on IMDb.com to assist in deciding on films. For that reason alone I am writing this. Live Feed is like an Asian version of 1976's The Incredible Torture Show (aka Blood Sucking Freaks ) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/. Torture dismemberment murder cannibalism... sure it's all here along with a third-grade script pathetic acting and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy. The film takes place in China yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor. One gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend (how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film.) The film is absolutely awful even for a B-movie. Even if you were to download it for free it would be an insult to your hard drive. ",negative

" I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation this one is really lame. Even on a nudity-and-gore level it's incredibly boring (there is some of both but it's all sort of...meh). Before the home video revolution it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters). There is precisely one good (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere. The acting is among the worst I have ever seen. I mean even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy which can be fun to watch. Anyway most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate. Here those who don't read their lines like cigar-store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically. And this film does have one distinction: it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie then laughably overplotted for the ending. (Update: I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. She is by no means wooden. Not that she's good but she certainly isn't wooden.) Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness but with this one there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about. And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel! It's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. I sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it. ",negative
" 2002's undeservedly popular I Love the 80's is an inane idiotic offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show that was the first in a long-line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of VH1 which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter I forget which one now of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Out of sheer morbid curiosity (I'd guess that's what you'd call it) I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap. At least I can honestly say that I wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement-level to begin with. The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see) but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills *rolls eyes*...more like lack-thereof if you ask me! It's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so-called humor that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one-liner they shot off one after another! Altogether I have no problem in saying that I Love the 80's was/is trash of the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore. ",negative
" Let me being by saying the I followed watching this video by watching Saw and after Bleed Saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though I thought it was only fairly good. Bleed is pretty bad. The best part is seeing the female cast nude. The gore is very fake looking and over-done. It has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and I didn't want to stay to see the horrible ending. If I could I would ban these actors and actresses the only reason being is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has been in over a hundred other videos and I've also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures. They should not allowed to continue this madness. ",negative
" There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick's abundance of clichés throughout -- and I agree completely both with regard to the characters AND the dialog. I'd read about Elizabeth Berkly's awful performance in the equally-awful Showgirls which I've never seen - and her performance here while not awful is barely up to the standards of Lifetime's worse fare. There was not a hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldn't have been. If so it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance since there wasn't a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character performer or portrayal. The principal's handling of Liz's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable. Her husband's initial reaction and advice were likewise (Forrest Gump attacking Jenny's boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentally-challenged). The smarmy unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the profession. Finally (and frankly I rather enjoyed this part) the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs that you'd rather depend upon Barney Fife without Andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the Law and Order series' and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on Lifetime. Finally I found a kind of story within a story fascination with Josh's concoction of his being the victim of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement like going from F to F-minus. This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following and left an hour's blank film in the camera. But the writer(s) here proved with their ending they could do even worse. When the situation was finally resolved and righted this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption. This one's a 2* presentation; the second * because it does have some mild fascination.  ",negative
" I can't believe that this movie even made it to video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves. I literary asked for a refund. Take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store. It is not even good enough to be called a B rated movie. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick.

" The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free at college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free it's hopeless. Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie but I have never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents but I enjoyed it very much). It's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it. You want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with the Grinch. ",negative
" It seems like this is the only film that John Saxon ever directed and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera.

Now this particular prison has been experimenting on inmates and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course everything goes wrong and then there's all these infected people trapped in the prison some of whom are turning into zombies and the rest who suddenly just don't want to be there anymore. This just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say for itself and I stopped it before the end which seemed like it was coming a few times but no it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path. If one watched to the end they may well become a zombie themselves so don't risk it. 2 out of 10. ",negative

Some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better. Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak though they don't realise it.

The editing is good acting decent sound effects aren't too over the top. I would have give it a 7 for an indie film but the story aren't that interesting. It's more on the drama side character developments than a horror flick.

" David Arquette is a young and naive home security alarm salesman taken under the wing of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a golden boy scoring a big sale on his first call- to widow Kate Capshaw and her dopey son Ryan Reynolds. Things are going well for Arquette he is appearing in commercials for the security firm and he is falling in love with Capshaw. Then Tucci and his right hand woman Mary McCormack let him in on a little secret- they sometimes break into the houses of their clients in order to scare them and to get their neighbors to buy security systems from the firm. Arquette decides not to get involved taking Capshaw to meet his family and going through life with a goofy smile on his face. Then someone breaks into Capshaw's home and murders her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci and sets a series of traps resulting in a gun to his boss' head as Tucci pleads his innocence. Based on a stage play The Alarmist is not opened up well. The scenes where Arquette takes the Capshaw to meet his parents are badly played and completely unfunny. They are also out of line with the character Capshaw is playing as she gets drunk and tells sexually explicit stories to Arquette's mom Michael Learned. Other than these scenes Capshaw is not given much to do but she does a lot with the little she is given. Stanley Tucci looking just like Terry O'Quinn is a riot as the security firm owner. He is a creep who really does not understand Arquette's moral revulsion. However when he turns into a sniveling whiner after Arquette kidnaps him he is hilarious. Mary McCormack seems to have been groomed for a bigger role but she mostly stands around and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds is too old to play a dumb teenager but he is funny especially telling his own explicit sexual story to Arquette. The screenplay lurches from romantic comedy to dark comedy too soon. Capshaw meeting the parents is completely unmotivated except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone can break into her house. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the film just to give Arquette a reason to take revenge on Tucci. Arquette who has proven he is a good actor is awful here. He relies on the constipated mugging that got him through those AT&T ads and he is not a strong enough presence to build this weak film around. Actually Reynolds might have been a better choice in the role. Dunsky's direction is good nothing that will win an Oscar soon. Christophe Beck's light jazzy score recalls the type of film noir this film tries to be and it is really catchy on top of that. Despite the pluses Arquette's failure as a lead and the script's schizophrenic quality sinks the film. I do not recommend it. This is rated (R) for physical violence gun violence some gore strong profanity brief female nudity sexual content strong sexual references and adult situations. ",negative
" This is a truly awful film. What they have done is taken a TV show which was never aimed at young children & given it the George Lucas treatment (i.e. ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience). OK so the Thunderbirds TV show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of shows in fact it was pretty formulaic but it was always enjoyable to watch (especially when the models got blown up) and the voice cast wasn't too bad. This suffers from bad casting & bad acting (with the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope & Ron Cook as Parker who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played) & after this travesty I wouldn't let Frakes direct traffic. The whole point of Thunderbirds was that it was about the whole Tracy family & how they worked as a team preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters. Avoid this rubbish like the plague. I only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported. ",negative
" There's a major difference between releasing an original intense edge-of-your-seat scary gore-fest and doing like filmmaker Eli Roth and his team have done with Cabin Fever and simply acted like it. The film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious fast-acting flesh-eating disease. It's not long before the friends turn on one another and can barely stand the sight of one another much less want to be in the same vicinity as them. As gross as it all sounds there's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker. Unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting a hackneyed script so profanity-laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than (in one instance) an on-screen appearance by director Roth. This is sloppy film-making in several ways! Avoid this time devourer. ",negative

This film wasn't worth the Memorex DVD-R it was burned on; I thought I was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents' camcorder.

So apparently it's supposed to be bad on purpose; However if you should end up in Hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo you'll see that Yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick. The actors attempt dramatic kick-ass performances comparable to Crimson Tide but come closer to The Marine. The crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are awful. The story is C-movie at best-- the plot isn't even good enough to be considered B-movie caliber. The dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty but is crap like everything else. Rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies. Plus the techno score is annoying... not because it's techno but because it's NON-STOP. That's right the music plays in the background THE WHOLE TIME acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I don't care what the disclaimer claims I don't buy it. BOTS was not made this bad on purpose because it takes itself WAY too serious for what it was: a joke. This film was very low-budget. But that is no excuse for its record-setting suck factor. Great films are born of substance not budget. BOTS had neither. Allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if I were having a three-way with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood of the Samurai came on I'd be out of there quicker than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision. Undoubtedly some people will try to defend the movie. Two maybe three. They'll say it's grindhouse chop-socky! or cheesy in a good way! or it's so bad it's good! Those people are idiots. A movie is either good or it's bad. There's no such thing as a good bad movie. But there ARE such things as idiots that like crappy movies. Don't get me wrong; there are lots of cornball not-to-be-taken-seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining. Slither is one. BOTS is not. This suckfest runs about an hour and a half and in my humble opinion it's 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this film is the DVD cover so next time you're near the Wal-Mart DVD bargain bin take a look at it-- DON'T TOUCH IT just look-- and quietly walk away. ",negative
" I will start this off by saying I couldn't get all the way through it. I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I figured there wasn't any way I would regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now who approved this project? They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam. The acting isnt much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. Yay who cares... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understood. Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many co-workers to watch. Each comes back and laughs and says Wow I didnt think I'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in.... My response is always Well now you can  ",negative
" Thanks to this film I now can answer the question What is the worst movie you have ever seen? I can't even think of a close second and I've seen some really bad movies. Absolutely nothing works in this film. Name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails. Honestly I've seen better on YouTube. Here's some typical dialogue: Steve? Steve? Steve is that you? Steve I'm not kidding Steve this isn't funny! Steve are you there? Steve? Steve? Steve? ARggh!!!! Ahhhhhh!!!! Nooooooo!  ",negative
" Yet another venture into the realm of the teen-gross-out-comedy set on a college campus featuring a nerd's quest to coolness and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular jocks into making him get the girl. It's all been done before and it's all been done in a far more satisfying manner. The gross-out humor that has made teen flicks like American Pie and Dude! Where's my Car so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove. The film is badly written and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly bearable. I won't even dignify this terrible picture by divulging as it's a waste of my time and yours. At best Slackers never manages to entertain or induce laughter and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable. Jason Schwarzman who impressed in his debut Rushmore humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end up in the toilet so fast. Please avoid please avoid. Save your money. ",negative
" I have to confess that I am severely disappointed. This version can in no way compete with the version of 1995. The reason why I watched it was that I wasn't entirely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the Captain I had imagined when I read the book. And he was too. Unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film. The rest is as un-Austen-like as possible. Miss Elliot would NEVER have run through the streets of Bath like this. It wasn't in her character and it just wasn't done by a lady of the those times. The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst. Although there are 3 important quotes from the book they are at entirely inappropriate moments warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed. And although this version is not much shorter than the other one it feels like everything is rushed. Very little care was taken to introduce the characters show their dispositions and motives. Important scenes were omitted. How could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way ? A disaster ! And it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one. No no no. If you love Austen then don't waste your time with this. ",negative
" Notorious for more than a quarter century (and often banned) it's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems. Hey it's often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you can't back the legend up with substance. The film has played in Los Angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that veil is slowly being lifted. While there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than arouse much real passion. Except for a gratuitous and protracted XXX sex scene between a pair of horses ( Nature Documentary anyone?) there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama. Once the sex and nudity begins it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation a looooooooong flashback to an alleged 'beauty and the beast' encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion (nobody even her supposedly protective Aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her!). On video I guess you can fast-forward thru the banality but it's not really worth the effort. The nudity doesn't go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as Bertolucci's THE DREAMERS. Try as one might to find some 'moral' or 'symbolism' in the carnality I doubt it's worthy of anyone's effort. Unfortunately for LA BETE now that you can more easily see the film the notoriety of something once 'forbidden' has been lifted. And this beast has been tamed. ",negative
" I saw this movie the first time at about twelve o'clock on a Saturday evening. It really is the perfect time for this one. I have never EVER seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes. If you want to see a thrilling action movie don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through. However if you want a good laugh please watch it! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night. What especially struck me is that évery scene that would be expensive to make was copy-pasted from a Discovery documentary or an old TV-special on the US Army. Furthermore I was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real. Afghanistan is as far as I can remember nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click Deke escapes from the terrorists sand-castle with his jet-pack and is taken away by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later on in the movie Deke throws an Islam terrorist against the wall. In the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the Korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall. Gotta love it. I recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though only then you'll understand why I've been mad enough to spend 6 99 euro's on the box. ",negative
" I totally hated the movie. It was so retarded. They need to get some acting lessons....no wait that won't help because the Naked Brothers Band people a retards. You know why I am here even though I am a Naked Brothers Band hater? To warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the NBB doesn't get any money from it so then they can't make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds. Not only are the song lyrics retarded they sing badly. Okay I'm kinda getting off the movie here.....anyways it was boring and they acted horribly. It was NOT funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be. I guess they deserve some credit for that...well the movie isn't worth your time. Just look at its rating. The movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain. Seriously if you liked it you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act not babbling their lines in a monotone. I am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually BETTER than those Nat and Alex guys. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie. I don't even know why I went through even HALF of that film. I don't think it even deserves to be called a film...

" This is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the world's best. The National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE BLOODY AWFUL MOVIES! This one isn't especially bad. It's especially typical and typically bad shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction high school level acting and gee whiz...lets see what this button on the camera does?? photography. If Michael Moriarity was so intent on doing a Jack Nicholson impersonation couldn't he at least have done a GOOD Jack Nicholson impersonation? And if the movie was shot in Vancouver truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building (part of the plot ) why in God's name do we let that endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as Seattle??? Not only am I mad about this film I'm embarassed and more than a little ashamed. The Australians turn out some splendid stuff. We produce pretentious second rate piffle. Gawd!!!!! ",negative
" I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo it but not last night). Woke up at 3am (invesment banker on the west coast) and was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a commentary on iMDB. This is really really bad. the writing is boring but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school. Yes it is shot video. Mind you that is shot on VIDEO not DIGITAL VIDEO. It does look like a soap opera. The clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror. I wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything. The shots and blocking are stupid. yes i chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional not daring not bold not boring just stupid. I know people reviewing this review will say well give me an example . I cant. It was 3am. but trust me I know you will watch it anyway you will be drawn by the horrible reviews. ",negative
" The reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist Robert James Waller also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A failing couplea blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong self-directed criminal and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin she leaves the impotent partner for the killer who bad as he is sees her more clearly than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A serious waste of time. ",negative
" The Howling II starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by Christopher Lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason. He says for it's written the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with her blood. And I saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication's and upon her forehead was written behold I am the great Mother of #an inaudible word I couldn't make out no matter how many times I rewound the tape and tried to sorry# and all abominations of the Earth . This opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre. After the opening credits which are set over shots of Transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we're in 'Los Angeles California U.S.A. City of the Angels'. I knew I was in for a long 86 minutes. It's probably not too long after the events of the original Howling (1981) and it's Karen White's funeral. After the ceremony Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) is spoken to by an 'occult investigator' called Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee) who says that Karen is a Werewolf and that she will come back to life. Ben dismisses such nonsense. But together with one of Karen's friends and colleagues Jenny (Annie McEnroe) he visits Stefan at his home. There Stefan tells them about Werewolves and how they can be killed he mentions Stirba (Sybil Danning) who is the queen of Werewolves. Stefan also shows them a photograph taken at Karen's funeral of a woman named Mariana (Marsha A. Hunt) and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous Werewolf who wants Karen. Stefan says he will stake any Werewoves through the heart with titanium. Ben figures out that Stefan means he will stake Karen as well so together with Jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister's crypt is to stop Stefan. However lots of Werewolves turn up and attack Stefan Ben and Jenny. They survive the attack and manage to find out that Stirba is to be found in Transylvania. They all decide to travel to Transylvania and stop Stirba and her Werewolves from taking over the Earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse. Once there they travel to a small town called Vlkava which means 'where wolves live' and meet up with the local priest Father Florin (Ladislav Krecmer) and his small but loyal group of Werewolf hunters hey what else can I call them? Oh and a dwarf named Florica (Ludmila Safarova) helps too. They follow Mariana who they hope will lead them to Stirba. But Stirba knows of Stefan's arrival and has plans for him Ben and Jenny. Will Stefan be able to put an end to Stirba's plans for world domination? Will this film get any more bizarre or surreal? Watch it and find out. Directed by Philippe Mora this is one strange mess of a film. It's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently. The single biggest problem is the script by Robert Sano and Gary Brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like. Luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring unlike the original. Something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained. Most people will probably hate it but for those of us who enjoy 'bad' films this is right up there with the best of them. There are Werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch. We get some cool Werewolf killing weaponry. The sets and locations just seem so out of place and I don't know if this was actually shot in Transylvania but it doesn't look like what I thought mid 80's Transylvania would. Stirba's castle is part dungeon part Gothic castle and part modern luxury house. Stirba and her servant's costumes are very over-the-top Stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a S/M video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too. The special make-up effects range from good to poor a dwarf's eyes explode someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn't a film loaded with gore although there are plenty of effect sequences with Werewolf transformations and attacks. There is plenty of nudity as well as Stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of Werewolves! I should also mention the music the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that I hated and I ended up turning the volume down. Acting is weak all round and what on Earth was Christopher Lee thinking about when he accepted this film?! I wonder what he thinks of it. Basically the whole thing is a real mess but I found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same. Impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end. Speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage it also features the same shot of Sybil Danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times! If that's your thing. ",negative
" The first Cube movie was an art movie. It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand. It was on the non-literal level a man vs. cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end triumphing to face a new indefinable world beyond man's petty squabbles; a world where there were no more struggle but peace. I rated Cube a 10 out of 10 and it's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels. The second movie Hypercube was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. Still for being fairly entertaining I rated it a 5 out of 10. The third movie Cube Zero while ignoring the second plays like a vastly inferior commercial B-movie rehash of the first sans the symbolism. There is no homage or tribute here; there is only ripping off. The same kind of plot with some elements idiotically altered (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say). That we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment the architects of which we hear nothing of. And in this movie those who get through to the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where the *bleep* is the sense in that?! That's just flippin' stupid. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10.

" I really really wanted to like Julian Po. I think that Slater is underrated as an actor and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read. So I do not know if what I see as the film's faults originated with the story or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. The premise is wonderful and I loved the voiceover confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he doesn't answer because it's none of their business. But Julian is the one who under only token pressure blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the director/writer despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for God's sake seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julian's life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child due to his father's job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julian's purpose. But none of them go anywhere because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. This might work as an allegory if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character --as rendered--as selfish petty and totally condescending. Sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked contrived film. And poor Michael Parks an actor who once had so much promise is given nothing to work with here. ",negative
" A different look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting. However from my American perspective this movie just wasn't that good. The protagonist Marie played by Anastasia Hille wasn't a pleasant character and I had a hard time identifying with her. She was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left. Also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film. Then a long time passed before any real suspense built up. Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all I'd recommend it for renting but not for theater goers. ",negative
" This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of Night of the Living Dead . Good thing to as I would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper. In execution it's a different matter. This short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me. I really never thought I'd say this but Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil Mutant Alien Flesh Eating Hellbound Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D was a VERY better parody and not nearly as lame or boring.

" A mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of Sheriff Bart from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles into his own weekly sitcom this is really as bad as some people say it is! The laugh-track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is! However it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to impersonate Cleavon Little. His embarrassment shows through in every scene. He was much funnier in the HBO movie El Diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese! Truly the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse! ",negative
" Adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they're two different mediums . Do you think it's a great idea to make ZULU into a stage play ? Imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping Blimey there's thousands of them out there Great movie and a bad stage play In order for a stage play to make great cinema there's two essentials needed 1) A fine cast that creates on screen chemistry 2 ) Great dialogue On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles . The story revolves around a hit-man played by Palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by Cher with most of the action taking place inside the house . I was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can't decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . Since the story is very static it's of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts . if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give FAITHFUL a miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead ",negative
" Well I'd be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spiderman or the Batman movies. Still it was more appealing to me for it's moral value. I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie Hollywood Shuffle . True he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable but his movies are still fun. Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel. I always felt that if there were superheroes they wouldn't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics. Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems: Car broken into bad neighborhood local drug-dealing gangs using children for distribution etc. The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community. What I found to be truly entertaining outside of James Earl Jones' young forever performance was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers. It wasn't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him without his input of course. It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived. Yes the plot was weak the movie was predictable there was bad acting and continuity was rotten but it ranks #1 with my kids. Robert Townsend works to bring movies home so to speak. I doubt he'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor/producer/director he truly is but there are and will always be those that love him for his efforts. One point to ponder about the film which I find amusing: Throughout the entire battle with Simon no one bothered to call the police???? Also what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window? My mother would have been right there scrapping by my side toe-to-toe. Dad would be loading his pistol. lol Rent it and check it out. It's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of Sinbad Luther Vandross Bill Cosby Big Daddy Kane etc. Great job with the cameos Robert! ",negative
" Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time; Meet Me in St Louis The Bad and the Beautiful. I awaited this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. Some Came Running is scene after scene of go-nowhere fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sack returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships a disappointing floozy hanging on him living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project. The movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence is intended to be tension-filled but Minelli is no Hitchcock; he gets so distracted by pretty colors he doesn't notice the scene is a wheezing cliché and the characters are so thinly-drawn and poorly developed we don't particularly care that they get shot. (especially MacClane) But that's the only real cinematography in the project. Otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours. Hell IS other people apparently. There is nothing going on in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after WW2 is handled more deftly in 'The Best Years of Our Lives.' And either of two Inge products 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end town with much more poignance. ",negative
" I thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful. It was slow pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out Yaowwww! while someone taps randomly on a wooden object. That being said there are some pretty songs but it's not worth seeing hte movie over. Go on itunes (they have the album) preview it and choose the good ones. Half the movie is some guy making tea.

" I had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining like other sorts of its genre. However it was lame and I didn't find myself laughing very much. Watch it on HBO maybe or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time. But I don't recommend paying to see it. The plot is simple and straightforward and it could have been funny maybe if the script was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious and he gets a few laughs here and there but the movie falls flat. Just don't go see this one. The directing is lackluster but for what it is directing isn't that important. I guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny. See something else don't waste your time here. ",negative
" 9 the film I've been looking forward to for months.... was little more then a disappointment. I was deeply surprised by 9's lack of story and strange character development. All the awesome action sequences in the world don't make up for a single unsympathetic character. The strange almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists... why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices?? How what when why.... questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater. A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth.... I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons name to draw in the crowd. Which... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect. 9 could have been awesome... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators. ",negative
" Ah the infamous Guinea Pig series...I honestly have to say that I've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ( He Never Dies Mermaid in a Manhole and Flower of Flesh and Blood being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...) but Devil's Experiment just plain blows. There is nothing realistic-looking going on here other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to hideous (more often sometimes hilarious ) tortures. Flower of Flesh and Blood is a more violent and gory depiction of fake snuff material but that film also falls flat on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in extreme film-making but Devil's Experiment just doesn't hold up. Worth a look if you are a die-hard if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene...

" This film was slated to be a blockbuster film and it really is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind the movie delivers perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man but well enough. Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. Many viewers myself included will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered but that only makes the film a poor adaptation not a poor film. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind. The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cameos. The main characters of Wolverine Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye-candy. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30-minutes as is Sabertooth though Victor does pull off some surprises late in the film. The final boss of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character. Very disappointing...

" I saw this movie way back when it premiered. It was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed-out messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their hands. Then suddenly these children many of whom weren't even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out (they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances) but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy left and right. This whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder opened it to the child and said 'type the picture you see' then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator a fold would fall down revealing another different picture. So while the child may have seen a dog the moderator saw something like a boat. Every time every bloomin' time the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed never what the child was shown. So who was doing the typing? Never the child. This movie further took a disastrous turn with as the Australia poster stated the person who molested the child in the movie was IN the situation trying to help the child. Had Melissa Gilbert never put her son IN that place he wouldn't have been molested is what the movie says. He was better off under her supervision. If I turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead do you think I'm going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that? Not likely! I think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out that this movie was based on they never accused someone within their operation as took place here. Unfortunately I do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from Gilbert as the mother of an autistic but other than that the movie really didn't do much. The worst by far was the child typing at the end to Patty Duke and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed . . . . . we won! This child was molested. If you cut my leg off and I take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me assault whatever then that is legal justice but it doesn't bring my leg back. At best in my condition I will view it as a hollow victory. Whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation. A 'normal' child has enough to contend with from such an experience. It's utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go 'we won' if that person is found guilty in court. Just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here. ",negative
" I'd never seen a Tarzan movie before so when I saw it on the tele I thought I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight. Not how I'd imagined Tarzan would look. And unless I missed it while making myself a cup of tea Tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell. Also missing was Tarzan swinging through the trees - leaping from vine to vine. Oh well so much for expectations. Anyway Jane was there - The monkey Cheeta was there. There was some guy with a guitar there. There were villains and good guys and a romance... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad you understand but equally nothing good. Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10 ",negative
" I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie coming out based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is miscast and doesn't carry the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith....or rather her silly insipid role. The real problem and what's lacking in this latest version is a good script music and direction. I fell asleep in the theater watching this long drawn out and exceptionally boring movie. There are more pauses in the dialog than a Pinter Play. In the book I felt a deep caring for Catherine Sloper and her life. The movie had just the opposite effect. I also disliked the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. Watch it if you can't sleep it's a definite snoozer. Don't watch it if you're depressed. You'll need Zoloft after this. Sure The Heiress was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the title roles. The actor who played her father was on the mark as the uncaring cold father....still grieving for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The movie was not faithful to the book but neither is this one. This movie was a box office flop. I have no doubts as to why. ",negative
" I watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers.Even the cover of the DVD looked good.As soon as I started watching it I was thinking like others oh my God whats this .There were some moments that were a bit creepy but then the mood was ruined by stupid music.There was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes.That right there ruined it for me and i was shaking my head thinking damn I wasted money again on a rental and was deceived by the cover art.Nothing against the music itself it was just in the wrong parts of the movie.Whoever edited the film has no clue what they are doing.The cover showed lightning implying they were caught in a storm at sea.That would have been more interesting but it didn't happen. The acting wasn't the worst i've ever seen considering they are all unknown and this is obvious their first film.Another reason I was disappointed was the plot made no sense.In the beginning 2 men saw all of the teens get on a boat then at the end supposedly only 1 girl existed and the others were either her imaginary friends or were ghosts i'm not sure because it was very badly portrayed. WhyteFox who wrote a comment on here claims this is a true story.He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area this movie was filmed.There was no mention in this movie about it being a true story.I have never experienced something like that personally but am not saying it's impossible.I guess if anyone is interested in renting this movie do it at your own risk.If you like amateur student horror films you may like this.

" Turkish Cinema has a big problem. Directors aren't interested in global cinema. They are local and folkloric but want to be international. This brings kitsch results such this movie. Film has jokes translated to Spanish from Turkish and they don't have any meaning for non-Turkish audiences. Even for Turkish audiences after 10 years. Players even Ferhan SENSOY have a worse acting than average. They act like puppets. Movie was shot in Cuba but nothing includes about Cuba. So Cuba is thought like a banana republic. Waste of money waste of time. ",negative
" This series just gets worse and worse. Poorly written and just plain not funny! The premise is excellent but the writer's inexperience shines through. By trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone. Now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about and resorted to that patronizing smug Oh silly you style acting that comes with a no laugh script. They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say aren't we zany? Isn't this funny? Well no it's not actually. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder with the exception of Corner Gas Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV. Come on CBC you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of Canadian talent.

" Former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy Rob Lowe stars in a film set in a high security American prison . I had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ but PROXIMITY isn`t that kind of film it`s more like a Man on the run film like THE FUGITIVE . It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases ",negative
" The Van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van in order to seduce them. The only thing this movie doesn't fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the US in the late 70s. It looks like it was totally made by amateurs. It's trash but I loved it! I have to admit I am a fan of 70s trash! Hope this one makes it to the IMDB bottom 100! 2 ",negative
" My first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us Blair Witch Project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage. The acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of Oklahoma and the plot such as there was is predictable boring and inane. 85% of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them. Mother F seems to be the writer's favorite because it is used constantly. It must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call. Thank God I rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward. Don't waste your time or money with this. ",negative
" this by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it. borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens doesn't result in a movie like them. if this going to be a top Korean movie I'd rather won't bother to see even a Korean movie trailer... By the way this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. I think every Korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 even though has no clue what it is about. ",negative
" This is far worse than those awful Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s. They were terrible but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie resurgence. New audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest. It was to be expected. But how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of... I can't even think of a word. I'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing. The impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas act and that's where it belongs. The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature. If this film was someone's first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy I'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok. The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. And you know these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to Stan and Ollie. ",negative
" I am not an artistically inclined individual. I am a science minded woman and I felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget. I watched part of it with my fiancé and my future step daughter. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My fiancé and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to Ocean's 13 but that is another story. Not to be deterred I awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot. I began again watching this movie in earnest. I just don't get it I thought I would get it.I thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers. Interesting and still it had dead stuff inside. It was an odd and bizarre movie. Maybe this is what they were after however I won't be tricked a second time! ",negative
" This is a movie about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a one-night sexual encounter and declares it a love story. Of the ten monologues I felt only three really had any kind of truth ring through them. I kept waiting for the film to get better and it did a bit but never better enough. This is an interesting concept and I kept wanting it to be good but it never succeeded. Maybe if they actually WERE love stories it would have worked. ",negative
" It's terrible how some people can get away with such things... This is one of those overrated things again... And I hate things that are overrated that are no good... Why can't we have more TV Shows and Movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something?? It takes many people to make this movie the series and the band all possible and those people are all wasting their time... It seems that the bands are getting younger and younger... I looked at how small that they were and I thought that they were 5 or 6. It's sad that kids are performing that young... They are still too young... Performing takes a lot of work and they have many other things that they need to do with their lives... The idea about having a very young band is horrible... They need to stop having bands like this... And I don't like the idea at all nor the kids themselves... They are very annoying very young and their name is The Naked Brothers Band The people that are involved in this and the people that are supporting this have all lost their minds... Whenever this band is shown on TV change the channel and petition to get it banned... And I know that this is a very boring comment thing but you get the point... This Band Sucks... Get Rid Of It...

" Well it looked good on paper Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborate again this time on a mix of heist movie Da Vinci Code American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear this is to Indiana Jones what Speed 2 is to Speed. A reasonable cast(including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) battles against a puerile script and loses badly. The film is little more than an extended advert for the Freemasons.However these Freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and nobody mention 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.)I don't think I've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none. There is virtually no suspense no surprises and no climax- it just stops. National Treasure aims for Dan Brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo sans the humour.

" A terrible amateur movie director (no not Todd Sheets) his new friend and sister explore a cave. The friend and sister fall in and get rescued. Meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'turf'. Whatever the heck that means. This film and I use the term VERY loosely is so bad that it's.. well bad. The humor is painfully unfunny the action merely sad. Now I've seen some atrociously awful 'horror' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films yet I still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this. ONLY for the most hardened maschocists amongst you. but the rest run away FAST!! My Grade: F ",negative
" Quentin Crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully one is a romantic. When things are show unbearably grim they are realistic. And when something gets the ironic treatment they're spot on. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa he falls into the second catagory. This director has obviously tried too hard to make a Spanish Ken Loach type movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that elevate Loach movies from merely being 'depressing'. Los Lunes al Sol is just that only depressing. Things are unrealistically grim. The characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point and if the glum story isn't enough Aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette. The films was ridiculously over-rated at the Goyas. A movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society in this case unemployed harbour workers does not automatically make for a good movie even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people. This movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate. In 21st century Spain unemployed people do not live like beggars and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms and it's hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously doesn't have a clue about working class Spain and does it no favours. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene where the men watch a football match for free has been directly copied from a film which deals much more 'realistically' with the subject of the 'poverty' trap namely Purely Belter which is afar more engaging humorous and yet sad.

" How Disney can you get? Preppy rich girls act like idiots buy a bunch of stuff and get taught a lesson. Is Disney trying to send a lesson to itself? That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human? Whatever the psycho-analysis this movie sucked. The girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes milk) going to employ the workers. They keep it afloat until daddy comes home. And the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one. But the ending is dumb. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Huh? Not worth my time ever again.

" I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in. But if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. It's sickening. Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship. He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple. It's revolting. I don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles.

" I purchased the BLOOD CASTLE DVD on eBay for a few bucks not knowing what it was and all I can say is that I wasn't disappointed with this purchase. BLOOD CASTLE is one of those trashy European horror films that has almost no redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining for all the bad reasons. The opening alone was worth the price of the DVD: our heroine Dr. Ivanna arrives at the castle where she's supposed to help a scientist Baron Dalmar who does experiments on dead tissue. On her way to the castle 1) a man tries to rape Ivanna. 2) the castle's housekeeper fights with her. 3) the maid wants her dead. 4) and finally Baron Dalmar nearly spits on her and wants her out the next day. Hmm...something tells me she's not welcome. With such a miserable arrival you'd think Ivanna would leave the place in a NY minute but no like so many great trashy films our headstrong heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a candlelight dinner with the grumpy Baron on that same eventful day. The intro is so over-the-top trashy (it's even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that Canadian film JUNIOR) that I knew I was going to enjoy this. But the fun doesn't end there. Ivanna is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night only to wake up from unconsciousness naked bound and tortured in mild sessions of S&M by an unseen man. Even after experiencing these nightly S&M sessions Ivanna stays at the castle dully convinced by the angry Baron that what she's experiencing are nothing more than dreams. To be expected even after being treated so badly from the get-go Ivanna falls in love with the Baron. Ivanna completely disregards anything negative about him including the obvious fact that the dour Baron is popular with the young ladies. Every women at the castle (it seems only women work there) is in love with the miserable chump who doesn't mind taking advantage of the pretty young things. Things get even sillier as someone lurks around the estate and kills (and has been killing) women. Basically the Baron's physically disfigured brother Igor is responsible for everything. In a very long winded scene the brother warns the Baron he should not get too involved with Ivanna or he'll suffer the consequences. So what do the Baron and Ivanna do about this? Well they get married of course! During the very brief marriage ceremony the Baron is shot by one of the angry locals (father of one of the dead girls). But all of this doesn't deter Ivanna who amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them cheerfully comforts the hurt Baron that it's just a flesh wound and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle where the killer/rapist/torturer brother is. The whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts between Ivana the Baron and Igor. Blame it all on love! Anyway you get the idea: subtle it's not. Almost everything is over-the-top ridiculous in this film and when it's not OTT such as the predictable climax things get a tad boring. But for most of the film the director or writer revel in one illogically trashy moment after another. I really love these kind of films everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a sledgehammer and populated by characters behaving illogically. Even those who made the Retromedia DVD realize this and when you go to the scene selection section we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie looped endlessly. The production values are beautifully risible. The opening and closing credits with those candles and red curtains...ah a soupçon of class. The music sounds sometimes like something from a Tim Burton film which only adds to the oddness of it all. And customary to these kind of films when the young ladies take off their clothes they just beg to be killed. As a standard film I rate this a 2 but as a it's so bad it's good film I rate it a solid 8 stars. If you enjoy trashy films please watch this one. It's a must see. The only thing left for me to ponder about it: what would it have taken for that woman to get out of that freaking castle? ",negative
" Boy this movie had me fooled. I honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever boy I got the cold shoulder that time. This movie was and I'm truthful pretty damn good. It was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting. Some to the horrible acting and cliché killings were so painful to watch I almost laughed at how bad it was but to some extent I enjoyed it. The killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and Christmas which made things more intriguing. The POV camera angles were awesome. The movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. He is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He than takes his revenge as the snowman on the police officer who convicted him. This movie had such bad acting with the exception of Christopher Allport that is was funny. I will say that I am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror but in fact a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot but it wasn't executed right. All in all I like the movie at first but now it is really annoying. But this movie is way better and darker than the sequel. ",negative
" Is this film a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it isn't a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor but on quite a few occasions the poor acting poor directing and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake. The killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love. It is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna Austria and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time on this film though unless you are studying how NOT to act direct or script a film! ",negative
" I am an avid fan of horrendous movies anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit I went to the local Rent Shop and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too entertaining you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it it just has to be bad. And boy is it BAD. After viewing this horror-ific movie I was speechless literally. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words ...dude....What? Yes i am an enthralling individual. Heres a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is none at all ever constantly in WTF mode. The Characters; No development forgettable. The Music; Worse than porn. The Vampires; Theirs vampires? The Zombies; Theirs Zombies?

" This is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers.The director's desire to sound American is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since Peeping Tom . Two male cops (or one and a half more like as you will see) horrible murders a plot more complicated than complex.Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre(see the astoundlingly dumb l'inconnu de Strasbourg a couple of years ago).The scenes with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot-are among the worst ever filmed.Add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience.A violent and absurd conclusion followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the côte d'azur it's really the silence of the lame.

" Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line-readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades sassy barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair; even his smaller touches (like fingering a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) don't reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself an unsure filmmaker. In the Southwest circa 1950 a poor gambler (not above a little cheating) wins an orphaned would-be teen Lolita in a botched poker game; after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon the bickering twosome become prospectors. Some lovely vistas and an odd but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy-drama with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map. Shields is very pretty but--although the camera loves her pouty glossy beauty--she has no screen presence (and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever); every time she opens her mouth one is inclined to either cringe or duck. *1/2 from **** ",negative
" Like Freddy's Revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn't go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. This has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy. I've not alot to say about this. It's moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over. Uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series. ",negative
" Too bad neither the animals or Eddie Murphy had anything to say worth saying. this movie is just bland. Children's movie? Well if you're trying to get them to take a nap then maybe. It's just 90 minutes of some eye-wrenchingly poor animal lip animation to quips that aren't funny. And the lip-sync'ing makes the old Godzilla films look brilliantly done by comparison. Meanwhile Eddie Pluto Nash Murphy drones on with a suppressed understated delivery that is painful to experience. Apparently he's trying to modify his old manic persona but to what? In short all the magic and wonder of the 1967 original version is lost in this re-imagining or whatever it is. A town wants to bully some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad stuff. No really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things chain along with some stale jokes to a dull uninspired conclusion with no surprises. Rent the '67 movie. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.

" I have never seen a movie as bad as this. It is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is NOT funny. If you like this sort of movie then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2. If it had the necessary votes it would truly belong on the bottom 100. ",negative
" This is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you don't. If you do you'll love this. Personally I prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers and Eleanor Powell Bill Robinson Ruby Keeler James Cagney Shirley Temple and so forth but the songs of the '50s the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off. This film is a case-in-point. The first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me. By then the story didn't have much appeal either. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus. I don't think I've seen a movie she starred in that I liked including this one where the goody two-shoes English teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave Siam. (I which she had!). However divorcing myself from likes-and-dislikes there is no denying this Rogers and Hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked The Sound Of Music a decade later. There are similarities in the R&H musicals. Thus if you liked the Julie Andrews flick you should like this too. This is a Lavish production with yes a capital L. This is the kind of big-production musicals you rarely saw after that generation. You also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isn't able to really sing so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue of Kerr as she did with Natalie Wood in West Side Story and Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. Yul Brynner is King Mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way. He isn't progressive as the left wingers like the say but the education teacher (Kerr as Anna Leonowens ) will set him straight. Secular-progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer! However Yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more-bark-than-bite character. Justifiably he is the big star of this film. Brynner had magnetism. Even in The Magnificent Seven Yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience. In summary it's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it. I'll leave it at that. ",negative
" This could have been a rather entertaining film but instead it ranks with other duds like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. Had they played this flick tongue-in-cheek it could have been a very entertaining film like Re-Animator or Dead ALive but Juan Piquor Simon plays it tongue-in-cheek in spots but straight more often. The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs. There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laugh riot - unintentional at that - which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and screenwriter) the scenario of destroying the slugs is. STORY: $$ (No new ground charted here. Simon seems to play the gore elements tongue-in-cheek but the dialogue is straight. Had Simon worked with a clever script - one with plenty of one-liners and eccentric characters this could have been a cult film). VIOLENCE: $$$ (You won't be letdown here. We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant. The blood and guts that many horror film watchers enjoy is in full swing here. You also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes). ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film-making endeavor is. Kim Terry as his wife does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold-your-face-while-you-scream bit. The teenagers were all horrible actors - no exceptions. Man this film could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) NUDITY: $$ (Two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched - in a poorly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's bedroom. Both male and female nudity here). ",negative
" Must every good story be improved with added corny Broadway music? Apparently those who can't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites as it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out and this was a great example of just that... So of course take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Fetch me a basin. The four stars in my rating come from casting which I could liken to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of but then they must go and have them sing (see complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of Oliver Reed (pardon if I'm mistaken it's been a while). My biggest complaint I've stated. Why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story? Seldom has this been done to good effect. Generally it ruins the story. It did with this one. Jury's still out on whether this story is worth saving but with all that gadding about it's impossible to tell. ",negative
" A woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive.The cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement.Of course B-horror movie queen Brinke Stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature.The only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard.And the last twenty minutes of Brinke's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch.The special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful.Better watch Scalps or Alien Dead again.Of course I ain't expecting classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray but Haunting Fear is too dull to be enjoyable.

" I am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur Yasujiro Ozu whose masterfully understated views of Japanese life especially in the post-WWII era illuminate universal truths. Having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949's Late Spring and 1953's Tokyo Story I am convinced that Ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery. It is Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien's keen aspiration to pay homage to Ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film. Among with co-screenwriter T'ien-wen Chu Hsiao-hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable. The story concerns Yôko a young Japanese writer researching the life of mid-20th century Taiwanese composer Jiang Wen-Ye in Tokyo after coming back from Taiwan where she taught Japanese. After 25 drawn-out minutes of character set-up she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in Taiwan. At the same time Yôko's coffeehouse friend Hajime who runs a used bookstore has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her. Hsiao-hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes. There are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains. While these techniques are consistent with Ozu's style Hsiao-hsien cannot seem to dive into the characters' psyches the way Ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics in particular Yôko's plight seems rather non-committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents' reaction overly passive to hold much interest. In fact the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it which makes the film feel interminable. The performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable. J-pop music star Yo Hitoto brings a natural ease to Yôko while Tadanobu Asano is something of a cipher as Hajime. The rest of the characters barely register even Nenji Kobayashi and Kimiko Yo as Yôko's parents. Cinematographer Lee Ping-Bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of Ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots. Hitoto speak-sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits Hito-Shian . The DVD includes an hour long French-made documentary Métro Lumière which actually does help provide some of the context for Hsiao-hsien's approach to the film. It includes excerpts from Ozu's films in particular Equinox Flower to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either Tokyo Story or Early Summer the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set-ups. There are also edited interview clips of Hitoto Asano and Hsiao-hsien as well as the film's trailer. ",negative
" so... it's really sexist and classist and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change. well he certainly changed his tune and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit. what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the movie does not make her a hero it makes the whole thing sad. and its sad that people think it makes her a hero. perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away. positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience. yuck.

" Confounding melodrama taken from a William Gibson story produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark heads up posh upscale rural nervous asylum where his loose wife battles with self-appointed queen bee Lillian Gish and Widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff-newcomer Lauren Bacall who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child. Facetious and muddled set in an indiscriminate time and place and with a David and Lisa love story hidden in the plush morass. Widmark and Bacall do have some good chemistry together but this script gives them nothing to build on. For precisely an hour most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library (this thread isn't used as symbolism rather it's a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they're working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right but unfortunately the roundabout way Minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative enlightening nor entertaining. ** from **** ",negative
" To heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story it's set in a special ward for difficult cases. The main story is Loretta Young's; she's on leave from a long prison stretch for murder. Will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husband's plea for the opposite? Melodrama and sentiment are dominant and they're not the honest sort to say the least. For example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies. There are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a Warners film mostly from Glenda Farrell who swigs gin from her hot-water bottle while she waits to have twins that to her chagrin she finds there's now a law against selling. An example of her repartee: Be careful. Farrell: It's too late to be careful. Aline MacMahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse but don't expect her to be given a dramatic moment. The main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush. Even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is. ",negative
" Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say that good old TheatreX took one for the team on this one. Guess what the plots about? Zombies taking over. This time though for the sake of originality (?) this film takes place in Rhode Island and to be honest I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie flick based in Rhode Island. A TV station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway. I will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film. There is actually somewhat of a story to this but I'm not bothering with that because after a while you'll either not care or have fallen asleep. At any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets trotted out before the camera. Trust me you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this. 3 out of 10. ",negative
" in this movie joe pesci slams dunks a basketball. joe pesci... and being consistent the rest of the script is equally not believable. pesci is a funny guy which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people which wasn't even well-played. instead of the man being an archetypal villain he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something...i don't even remember...she was that forgettable. anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film or at least one of those millions of media minions who can't critique efficiently (you know the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6). stay away...far away. and shame on comedy central where i saw this film. they usually pick better.

" I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my Horror this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen! I read the comment from Gumby-8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all. I couldn't believe Gumby-8's comments. Quoting: From the Dune inspired opening animation to the quick pace...this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected. The Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense. I mean give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of $100 000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic. As far as repeat viewing is not unexpected I think he made a typo. Another quote from Gumby-8 the only Fan: The acting is also a strong aspect of the film. With all due respect for the actors their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton. The catchy Tagline: Beware the hour between dusk and darkness That's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie. MPAA rating Rated R for some violence/gore The only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see. As far as I know it might be a clump of grass. In summation I have seen horror flicks from the 50's 60's and 70's. I have seen what I thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good. The director of this film either did not make any attempt was asleep or took a hit of acid. Whatever the case I think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction. I would give this film a rating of .5 for a 'B' movie. ",negative
" Me and my friend rented this movie for $2.50. And we both agree on one thing: THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! Also me and my friend counted 475 face shots. (Which makes up 95% of the movie). So in other words: DO SEE THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU LIKE WASTING MONEY! And I do! ",negative
" I hated this movie so much I remember it vividly. It is not even funny. Any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it.

" This is not a horror film but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie to be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot awful acting and annoying music. If you only watch the trailer you will know enough... It's a shame that such thing is available on VHS or video while there are so many good movies unavailable. If you like vampires try the Hammer Productions or the Italian Gothic from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. Those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash. Rating = even 1 is too much! And believe me I am not the only one with this opinion. ",negative
" Considering the limits of this film (The entire movie in one setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors total) it should have been much better made. IF you have these limits in making a film how could the lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible were talking a hair below the acting in Clerks except that was an enjoyable movie this had no substance. Well it tried to but really fails. It makes attempt to be self-referencing in a couple parts but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad. And the main character Neal guy what a pathetic looser. Clearly like 10 people total made this 'film' and they all knew each other and it probably was a real rock band that they had but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around. This was made in 2005 but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pre-grunge era. Thankfully I didn't pay to see this (Starz on Demand delivers again!) but it was under the title The Possessed not Studio 666 it doesn't matter what you do to the title it can't help this. This could have been a much better made movie - there is no excuse for this bad film-making when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can. Instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough. And that music video wow that was bad I fast fowarded through that. So 2/10 is fair if you are into the whole b-movie crap I suppose you'll go and see this. ",negative
" I cannot believe that they managed to spend US$17million on this film. Spectacularly bad acting egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average PC unbelievable plot contrivances...a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the UN? What? Not only that but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix. All this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe they would have used the money to help people truly in need. Now /that/ might have swayed some people into actually listening to them. ",negative
" This was a disappointing movie. Considering the material---army life is always good for a laugh---and the stars this movie should have been a fall down laughfest.

Steve Martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that Dan Ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow Robin Williams' lead and someday win an Oscar. ",negative
" In my opinion this movie's title should be changed from Only the Brave to All About Lane . I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome. Although I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale. The performances of Marc Dacascos Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were all great. However the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie. Sorry Lane you are just not a film actor. Stick to what you're good at - theater acting. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful... Why weren't they cast for that role? Another major problem with this film were its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers don't look like they were fighting German soldiers... let alone anyone. Granted this was a low budget feature but since this was a war-based film isn't it important to show some actually fighting? This film was a worthy attempt but definitely not worth a major distribution. ",negative
" I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film. Summer Of Sam conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer David Berkowitz. It's not. It's a gritty earthy portrait of NYC street life during the hot summer of '77 when Berkowitz terrorized that city. The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood and their reactions to the Son of Sam threat. There's Vinny and his wife Dionna; there's Richie and Ruby and several other characters. The problem is that these characters are not likable. They are routinely annoying and at times unbearable. Lee then belabors their high energy chaotic lives which are filled with anger lust and general turmoil. There are at least two protracted fight scenes between Vinny and his wife redundant disco dance scenes countless gabfests ... Over and over I kept wondering: where's the film editor? Meanwhile with all that bulk the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the Son of Sam menace which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups. The acting is uniformly good. That combined with 70's disco music and lavish attention to costumes and production design make you really feel like you are in an Italian-American neighborhood in NYC in 1977. The film's atmospheric authenticity however is not nearly enough to offset a rambling overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people. ",negative
" This movie was messed up. A sequel to John Carpenter's Vampires this didn't add up right. I'm not sure that I enjoyed this much. It was a little strange. Stick to the first Vampires it's a good movie. Vampires: Los Muetos wasn't a good attempt of a sequel. 4/10 ",negative
" This budget-starved Italian action/sci-fi hybrid features David Warbeck as a Miami reporter who is chosen by the ghosts of the people of Atlantis (!) to stop an evil businessman (Academy Award nominee John Ireland) from using a telepathic fetus grown using spores from an asteroid to rule the world. You got all that? Despite such a loopy plot this is actually quite a bore and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS sneers at it with contempt. Honestly the most (intentionally) creative thing about this flick is the slight reworking of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles. The most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a lab that is inexplicably shown twice back-to-back. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted to get all avant garde on us in the twilight of his career? I was going to declare this Ireland's worst film on his resume but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS was listed on there. I would also like to safely declare that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGO. ",negative
" Maybe I'm really getting old but this one just missed me and the old Funny Bone completely. Surely there must be something powerful wrong with this Irishman (that's me Schultz!). Lordy lordy what I would give to see the light! Firstly that Phil Silvers manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will. Although it is possible that the series first titled: YOU'LL NEVER GET RICH (1955-59*) could have gotten on the CBS TV Network with someone else in the title role of Sgt. Bilko it is very hard to picture any other Actor/Comedian in the business wearing those Master Sergeant's stripes. Such a strong identification is inescapable though not the same sort of career-wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like Clayton More( THE LONE RANGER ) George Reeves ( THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN ) and Charles Nelson Riley ( UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK ). One major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950's TV Screen to the 1990's Movie-going public is our collective memory. Without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the Bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals and their numbers were surely considerable; even a large segment of the young had seen Bilko reruns in recent times. It was obvious that the new film and the source were miles; or even light years apart. So as not to be thought of as a totally square old grouch please let's consider some other points. Right here today the 14th Day of November In The Year of Our Lord 2007 let me swear and affirm under Oath that I have been a Steve Martin fan for nearly 30 years Furthermore I've enjoyed the wit and talents of Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and the Late Phil Hartman. After all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others Alumni of NBC;s Saturday NIGHT and SECOND CITY TV that kept the last quarter of the 20th Century laughing. But a BILKO re-make; it just didn't click. Perhaps if the film had been made as a Service Comedy (always liked 'em!) but without the Bilko Show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like me. So we've already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately what's next? Howse about somebody doing Hal Roach's World War II Army Comedy Series of Sergeants DOUBLEDAY & AMES and TV's 1st Cartoon Series CRUSADER RABBIT ? Remember where you heard it first! POODLE SCHNITZ!

" Adrianne should really get a life-without Mr. Brady . She nauseates me and has been one of the main reasons why I know longer tune in to the show. It's pretty brainless show and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death. This makes them look/sound they are anything but ready for marriage and yet I know these disagreements are all part of life. I guess to some people this is entertainment. If this happens to fall into next season I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash. Though I would not be terribly surprised. can't even stand the commercials for this show anymore! I hope they're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week. However the A girl has one heck of great butt! ",negative
" What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul... or something like that. Guy Ritchie a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre bites off more than he can chew with this one. His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it's face. When Jason Statham's character no longer fears Ray Liotta it apparently drives Liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene. Why? Basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of Statham's character. Before anyone starts to say I'm missing the point... I'm not. I get it OK? Opt out of the quest for riches & you'll find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self-destruction. This seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story although hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off. At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realises this he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red-herrings: The scene when Statham gets knocked over by a car - Why? The shooting of some scenes as Marvel comic animations... again why? There are so many loose threads & unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001-ish about it and try figuring them out or simply accept that there are no answers & each viewer will interpret things in their own way. Myself? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that I simply didn't care. Frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that I didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble. A waste of two hours of my life. ",negative
" What an unusual movie. Absolutely no concessions are made to Hollywood special effects or entertainment. There is no background music not special effects or enhanced sound. Facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire. I sort of viewed these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience not really something to go and get entertained by. Its quite long and in places dull. But I suspect that given the lack of any plot development I don't think its very educational either. Its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening since for some reason the director didn't see fit to inform the audience why Che's band was moving around the way they did - as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at. I would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end. The stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare. ",negative
" Who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money. I hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring D-Lister actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one. I found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $2.99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one. Whoever thought that this straight-to-video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because I think what pretty much most of the people who've seen this film thinks WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!!!!

" The comparison is perhaps unfair but inevitable. Those attracted to the intimacy and depth of Umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut-and-paste musical in the American style - awkward stilted dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so poor that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted (as you'll remember the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in Umbrellas). The translation of the French (for subtitled versions) as well leaves something to be desired although this can't be attributed to Demy. The film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting such as references in songs to LeGrand himself. And the costumes - well the tight pants/white boots combination and the freakishly unnatural colors reminds one of an Austin Powers film . . . But Demy does reward the viewer with allusions to Umbrellas; note for instance the suitcase carried by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by Guy in his departure from Cherbourg. Also note the Convenient Brunette of Resolution - Madeleine in Umbrellas and Josette in Young Girls. Generally speaking those expecting the natural feel of Umbrellas (save the floating bicycle scene) or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in Umbrella's script should probably pass this one b y. Those looking for a French version of a thin '60s American musical will be quite happy. ",negative
" Wow I knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad. Spoilerific comments ensue. Roddy Roddy Piper is sickly sweet retired cop (cliche!) helping out everyone - smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient through-out and lamenting over his dead son. His adopted son returns from Armed Forces Special Ops and because he's seen things - portrayed by clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. Time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who the bad lad killed) and his adopted son. Oh the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex-Army bloke. This happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene. The action could have saved this film but it's even worse than the storyline and acting. It's all been done before it's all been done much much better (Ong-Bak is a prime example). This is the worst film I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. Erm the film is called HONOR (Spelt Wrong for the Americans) and the tag line has from the makers of Bloodsport and Kickboxer - check out Director David Worths other films and you'll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there even though they are over 10 years old. Such classics as Shark Attack 3: Megalodon - says it all really. I'll give you £10 if you don't go to see this film. PS - Apologise for not know character names tells you something though. ",negative
" This film looked interesting; I'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly. Started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations. In fact I didn't bother watching the whole thing... utter drivel - bad performances bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters - that was the point of the film I guess. Watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend. Do not bother with this feature. ",negative
" I saw the original Chorus Line on Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he would have to re-imagine Chorus for the screen but could never figure out how to do it. If the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question. There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. However Richard Attenborough fresh of the musical work of Ghandi and dancing with animals in Doctor Doolittle ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!) great songs were dropped or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). Michael Douglas was mis-cast. People that couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy Landers woman who couldn't sing act or dance - I guess she had just finished being Ghandi's wife. The dances by Jeffrey Hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from Flashdance rejects and nothing works. I sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing. If you truly love this show and it is coming back to Broadway in 2006 - see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was A Chorus Line has any thing at all to do with this film.

" Yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere. This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it. Once again we have an attractive 'straight' hero who supposedly can't get any woman to be interested in him. Yeah right! And we're also presented with the 'sympathetic attractive' gay friend who is actually a fat balding ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive. Even I didn't find him appealing and I'm a fat ugly old gay man (but thankfully not balding)! Whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script and truly awful direction.

" Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an *audience* like or empathize with any of the characters either. There are movies so bad they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films) and there's just plain bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's work ). This film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (e.g. Mystery Science Theatre 3000). Thankfully while I am rather talented in that regard (it's how my mind works All The Time) for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing eventually into *this* film you'll just want to pull your own head off painfully aware the movie Taboo robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back. Even my MSTie talents were barely a match for this slow paced boring waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that *someone* green-lit and/or funded it... I rented Taboo solely for the normally talented Amber Benson who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film. I've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue the reviews to which I'd better read first.

" This is a truly terrible film. I'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it. If I have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film I shall die happy. Unutterably dull although since it stars Al Pacino I was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. Then the credits rolled and I realised I had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel.

" This had a great cast with big-name stars like Tyrone Power Henry Fonda Randolph Scott Nancy Kelly Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known names with shorter roles. It also had Technicolor one of the few movies made with it in 1939. Now the bad news.......regrettably I can't say much positive for the story. It portrayed the James boys in a totally positive light....and Hollywood has done that ever since. Why these criminals are always shown to be the good guys is beyond me. This film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings. The latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous. Well that's the film world for you: evil is good; good is bad. Hey Hollywood: here's a news flash - The James boys were criminals! Really - look it up! ",negative
" i usually don't write reviews but i can't understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average TV watchers. i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché it wasn't even funny any more. the same old stories you've probably seen/read a couple of times already - living toys evil things from other dimensions... and it's not just that these stories aren't innovative they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés. i'd prefer e.g. chucky and silent hill over those two episodes anytime. and don't even ask about the visual effects... the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second... awful. looks like some film student's project gone wrong. blood... or gore... erm... nothing worth mentioning. it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn't seen/read that many scary stories yet (although i'd rather recommend beyond belief - now that's what i call a decent mystery TV show). but for an adult horror fan this is worthless. i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some nice acting.

" I think scarecrows are creepy so it's a pity this movie doesn't make more of them. A bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows. One of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows. The acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive (when they move). On the positive side the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows. It is as Alfred Hitchcock says A bomb under a table goes off and that's surprise. We know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off and that's suspense.  ",negative
" step aside for hollywood veterans? (the wayan brothers were 'asked') thats what hollyweird demanded and thats what it got. However like so many of its recent decisions this one was a stupendous mistake. The director is SO out of touch with todays audience attempting to bring back physical pratfalls and gags in place of funny dialogue is just a DISASTER. I knew it the audience knew it and the CAST knew it. What a shame why did they EVER consider changing directors? Not only that but the two Wayan brothers played as two of four primary characters without them its just a farce and a sad one. SP ",negative
" It's 1982 Two years after the Iranian Embassy Siege which involved the dramatic SAS Rescue from the Balconys and with a War with Argentina over the Falkland Islands currently taking place what better film to make than a Gung-Ho SAS Film that re-creates the Iranian Hostage siege whilst using Britains Number one action hero of the day Lewis Collins. throw in Edward Woodward and a few other Well known actors and you've got a winner on your hands?...Well maybe not! The film itself doesn't make the situation serious enough whilst the acting is quite second rate. it's like a Movie long episode of The Professionals but without the formula. This film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch Lewis Collins as a Touted James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore. Watch it if your a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS stuff in General if not save your time. ",negative
" There's enough star power in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy yet the final product is pretty debatable. The film and its messages are very noble and I think perhaps most would agree with them. (Liberal Democracy good violent fascist regime bad; open-mindedness good racism bad etc). Unfortunately we're battered from head to toe with these and as much subtlety is used as I've described them. Ultimately we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities. It radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated pro wrestling match. Jeremy Irons plays the patron a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close as her sister in law. When the camera stays with these folks the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS engages with simply way too many subplots and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets. We don't get to know them hence we don't get to care for them. The result is boredom. If Bille August the director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters this film might have worked completely. As it stands it was a nice try with nice messages and a bonecrushing yawnfest. Not recommended. ",negative
" I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just not there since the killer was known very early. The finale was again neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all a disappointing evening spent at the cinema. ",negative
" Leslie Sands' stilted play Deadlock becomes a poor-choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill just after their joint-success in All About Eve . After killing her spouse a scheming woman is visited by her husband's best friend who passes himself off as her husband once others begin stopping by the house. Irving Rapper one of Bette's best directors from her peak years is sadly unable to elevate this ridiculous material in which Davis is curiously aloof and restrained until the outrageous finale (where she thankfully pulls out all the stops). Production and supporting cast strictly second-rate; only for Bette Davis completists. *1/2 from **** ",negative
" This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role of Lane.They have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the Indian masses. Even then the movie has got the full traces of Unfaithful though it couldn't catch up with the original. It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors. Though the film bombed at the box office the actors got the undue recognition. In future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a Oscar nominated film. All said this is not a family film so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family. ",negative
" When an attempt is made to assassinate the Emir of Ohtar an Arab potentate visiting Washington D.C. his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named Sunny Davis. Sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the Protocol Section of the United States Department of State. Unknown to her however the State Department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda. A map we see shows Ohtar lying on the borders of Saudi Arabia and South Yemen in an area of barren desert known as the Rub al-Khali or Empty Quarter. In real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that Ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the Cold War and that the American government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler. It transpires that the Emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the State Department; they can have their base provided that he can have Sunny as the latest addition to his harem. Sunny's new job is just a ruse to ensure that the Emir has further opportunities to meet her. A plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the film's satirical content is rather toned down. Possibly in 1984 the American public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country's foreign policy; this was after all the year in which Ronald Reagan carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the Presidential election and his hard line with the Soviet Union was clearly going down well with the voters. (If the film had been made a couple of years later in the wake of the Iran/Contra affair its tone might have been different). The film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for Goldie Hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm. Sunny is a typical Goldie character- pretty sweet-natured naive and not too bright. There is however a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde. (Actually that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one). Goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds. Part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed. On the one hand Sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from Oregon. On the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume. The effect is rather like imagining Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm grown up and working as a Bunny Girl. The more important reason why Goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his/her material and Protocol is simply unfunny. Whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about Arab men who apparently all lust after Western women particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed. There was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties as this was the period which also saw the awful Ben Kingsley/ Nastassia Kinski film Harem about a lascivious Middle Eastern ruler who kidnaps a young American woman and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting. The film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day Mr Smith Goes to Washington . Sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about Democracy and the Constitution and the Citizen's Duty to Vote and We The People and how the Price of Liberty is Eternal Vigilance blah blah blah but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy. Goldie Hawn has made a number of good comedies such as Cactus Flower Overboard and Housesitter but Protocol is not one of them. I have not seen all of her films but of those I have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst. 3/10 ",negative
" Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain. PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess. A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were. I just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused. I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film. The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at. But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display. I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution. Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament. I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I'll be looking for the Soundtrack CD. In short a good movie to look at and listen to (the music that is) if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been ",negative
" This is an extremely boring film. If you grew up during the Vietnam Was as I did then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. But what really makes this film boring is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood. The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation. If you're old enough to remember Vietnam then you won't find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on John Kerry but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal. ",negative
" I've seen the movie only recently although it appeared in 2001. I hoped to see an entertaining movie but let me tell you Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The princess is not very talkative as you may have noticed... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme who only stared to make his point then beat the crap out of the opponents. During the entire movie I waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked why was she fighting who did she love and trust. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Crappy dialog. Don't watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds! It's so bad that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour. Approximately. I give a 4/10.

" As an engineer I must say this show's first season started out very promising. Most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible and the relationships portrayed between the Eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge. But after the first season the show started degrading heavily. Most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science & technology for real. The involvement from the actors still feels okay and I can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode but in the end this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade C action thriller and CSI style cop show. If you are gonna watch it go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second. Thereafter I would not waste my time. Myself I gave the show up midway through season 3. Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars Let's sum that up to 4 stars. Since Charlie doesn't know his math anymore I won't bother with the correctness of mine either. ",negative
" This is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced written and directed vanity project ...while I was working as a crew member John Carradine commented to me (before the burning at the stake sequence): This is the worst piece of sh*t I've ever worked on ...and I've worked on a lot of pieces of sh*t.

" Sadly it's true. Legiunea sträinä exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure. As it was already said the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. Maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy he only gathers a disordered pile of events unable to follow the least story-line. The script's level is similar to a Cântarea României amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only turned upside down: while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism now Daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology. The ideas content is zero and the message infantile and didactic at a kindergarten level. Unfortunately he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets. He isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation to order it in a correct movie scene to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like: Holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere and all da people is asses!

" Disney's done it again. The company that made Mr. Magoo and George of the Jungle has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based and keeps none of the spirit of the original. Inspector Gadget was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a young one and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then. Now that that movie does exist I was severely disappointed even outraged. First we have the characters. Gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon (with well-done special effects accompanying them) and he even has some of the naivete of the original Gadget but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain just watch. Penny has little to do; while she played a major role in the cartoon discovering the crime and halting it and occasionally getting captured by the MAD agents now she is simply introduced and then forgotten although she does at least sneak into Claw's base. Claw is the movie's version of Dr. Claw who was a rather sinister raspy-voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair his face hidden from view as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand with no mystery behind the character. Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie but are rather insignificant to it. Even small parts of the cartoon aren't spared in this butchering. The famous expression Wowsers! was mysteriously changed to Wowser and Gadget's Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks. There is even product endorsements everywhere. Why is Yahoo! advertised on a sign? Why does the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M&M's or Skittles? Fans of the cartoon will hate it others might will likely find the movie below par and when all is said and done this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show.

" he was my hero for all time until he went along with {if you can call it a movie} I went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero's acting and the hole thing was.............I can't believe that Steven Segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors. I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong. The plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book. Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all. I hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic. The condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner. My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds. I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget (Segal being paid 5 of that) and that the movie still came in under budget. I must concur. It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie . ",negative

Worst music mix Worst editing Worst script WORST ALL-TIME DIRECTING Worst acting Worst choreography Worst cinematography Worst props Worst sets Worst lighting Etc. Let's face it if this film had been in ultra-high contrast black-and-white AND silent... it still would have been awful. All scenes are dark (lighting people call it black ) often the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs which was OK because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect. The evil robot was hilarious... what was that? Jazz dancing? Oh... I guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something. I'm sure it struck fear into the hearts... of the poor editors. And how do you edit so much footage of garbage? Not possible. Garbage is garbage no matter how you splice it. How did anyone ever get this thru the dailys??? Bottom line is- I couldn't stand to watch more than 15-minute segments it was so bad... but I did see the whole thing (with lotsa breaks) just to see if it had ANY good parts in it at all. NOPE! NONE! A perfect example of how not to make a flick... a must see for EVERY serious film student!!! ",negative

However the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be and the asylum is being run by the patients and the doctors are in cages.

I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good but the film itself bombs.

" I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. After all this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to Fabio on the beach in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were actually decent trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle to them. Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I wouldn't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was (at least they got that part right). ",negative
" Usually I love Lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I'm biased I guess! But this one is just the pits. Yes the scenery and the buildings are beautiful and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between sulking and getting high/stoned/passing out on whatever drug or booze is handy and Ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior through the entire movie. At no time are we given any insight into why this is so or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. If there had at least been some kind of closure in the (potentially romantic? we don't even know!) relationship between the two there might have been some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamarie at one point asks Ella why do you love me? Ella doesn't even acknowledge this. It's never really clear whether this is anything more than an (ill-behaved) Lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman. Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey which could have been lively and informative are instead flat tedious and mostly incomprehensible. There is one good joke in the movie although I'm sure it was unintentional. The women travel in a two-seat Ford coupe with a middling sized trunk. Yet when they set up camp they have an enormous tent cots sleeping gear and even a table chair and typewriter! On top of that when they board a ferry we see piles of luggage presumably theirs presumably also carried in the little Ford's trunk! And through the entire film we never see one gas station or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gasoline. Mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert. So where did they get fuel? There may not be too many Lesbian films out there good or bad but there are plenty that are better than this and very few that are worse. Leave this one in the rack.

" The Good Earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The movie is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent as do most of the lead actors that I could not bear listening to him speak. It is a shame that Hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles. To take Anglos and make them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play African-Americans. ",negative

" For 50 years after world war 2 the United States was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time because of the draft and wars everyone in society had served or was connected to someone who had. This allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of American cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes that machine was non-US military for example in prisoner of war situations. Once removed are stories in other machines: science fiction and corporate but they always reference this military genre and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling. You can trace it I think perhaps starting in the comic meaning Amrican sections of The Great Escape which immediately spawned TeeVee offspring in Gomer Pyle and Hogan's Heros. Then a second wave triggered by Catch 22 and MASH both of which had been real life then books then movies and in the MASH case then TeeVee. But before all that there was the Phil Silvers Show about a Sergeant Bilko and this followed from Mister Roberts. A happy con man who only committed harmless crimes and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life. This was in the day when TeeVee shows mattered. You absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about. It wasn't particularly clever in any way except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. Its one large zone where Americans worked out how they think about forgivable even endearing lies in a military context a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here. Because its big it sometimes pays off in laughs. Stripes was pretty darn funny I thought. It had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes sort of folding in some Dirty Dozen. And sexual adventure. Now this well before the cultural wars escalated. It tries to touch that sweet spot like other remakes that manhandled Steve Martin. It is so unfunny you actually root for the Army to be the stronger player. Yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power.

" This is one of the silliest movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch! I should have expected it after seeing the first two but I keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of Maybe they did it right this time . Nope - not even close. Where do I begin? How about with the special effects... To give you an idea of what passes for SFX in this movie at one point a soldier is shooting at a Raptor as it runs down a hallway. Even with less than a second of screen time the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around. Bad bad bad bad. How about the acting? If that's what you can call it. There is one character who I suppose is supposed to be from the south. However after living in the south for six years now I have never heard this way of talking. Perhaps he has some sort of weird disability - the inability to talk normally. I find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one. How about the plot? It's pretty basic - Raptors escape people with guns must hunt them down. I'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels... wouldn't they stay outside to hunt prey? Oh well at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them. Other things - Let's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it. Would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better - Army or Marine? And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it? How about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors - Split up into groups of two. Didn't they ever watch any horror movies (Or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short this is one of the dumber movies out there. Miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie. ",negative

Natassia Malthe was Quintana and was far more attractive here than in Bloodrayne 2 . Michael Ironside is Muco and is always a fan favorite (as I say he's the poor man's Jack Nicholson). And we even get Carrie-Ann Fleming as Damian's wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous Jenifer from Dario Argento's Jenifer . So this movie as bad as it is isn't without some names attached... but the same can be said of Uwe Boll's work. The concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isn't necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard. The acting especially from the vampires is over the top and I just didn't find the explanations of their existence very convincing. Worst of all the vampire tribes have the names Voorhess and Leatherfaces . I understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it wasn't clever at all. It just sounded dumb and out of place (unlike the much more subtle references in James Gunn's Slither such as naming stores after lesser-known horror directors). That's all I want to say. If you can stand lots of cheese (on this day I couldn't and I'm from Wisconsin) and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space (although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth) check this one out if you can find it. I don't personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films (Jon Carpenter's Vampires ) or other cheesy space movies. Or maybe even some good ones. But hey do your thing.

" Oh well this movie starts off well. It's kinda funny and seems like it could be a fun movie. Then it becomes a bit serious and goes off the rails. It sort of wants to be 'Boogie Nights' but it can't achieve it. If only it stayed with the tone of the first quarter of the film... ",negative
" i think that new york is a big fake i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid. i enjoyed flavor fl av more better she acts like a slut and a hoe put together. her mother is out of this world i think she is the devils daughter. i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl. she is nasty spoiled and a big fat fake.the show is very interesting to watch how much money is she getting to do this awful show and whats up with her mother i thought her and new york did not get along but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter.and where is the so called husband he is no where to be found i would not to be with them either.

" Let me begin by saying I am a big fantasy fan. However this film is not for me. Many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but fails to investigate them more thoroughly which could have given the film some credibility. The film uses (nice!) CGI to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon's life. This is combined with popular-TV-show-CSI-style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific which it is definitely not. In many cases the arguments/clues are far-fetched. In some cases clues used to show dragons possibly existed or flew or spit fire are simply invalid. To see this just makes me get cramp in my toes. Even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it but this one just doesn't have it. Bottom line: it's a pretentious fantasy-CSI documentary not worth watching. ",negative
" This is quite literally the worst movie I have ever watched in my life. It may be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they're good; this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful. It is the anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intent to heckle and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks; instead we sat in stunned silence pitying poor Peter Sellers. This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It is worse than the Matrix sequels. It is worse than Krull. It is worse than any Batman movie. Do not under any circumstances let this movie approach within ten feet of your television. ",negative
" We have a lake. We have an animated meteor crashing. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers. Okay so let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of comic relief . We also got to have a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to. Aw crap we're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! No worries let's introduce some guy with a moustache have him rob a store to indicate he's a bad guy then have him pop up somewhere near the lake have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food. That should work. A complete clumsy mess this film. Its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you. The first film to feature Dave Allen as a stop motion supervisor . After this one he joined forces with Charles Band for several years until the the mid-nineties when Band ran out of money to pay him I guess. The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny. Unfortunately that's about the only good thing that can be said for it. Good Badness? Yes. The mind-bending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list. If not Arnie & Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10 ",negative
" Let me first state that I enjoy watching bad movies. It's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones. This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. This vehicle for Sam Mraovich's delusional ego doesn't just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words. This should forever be the barometer for bad movies. Sort of the Mendoza line for film. Mr. Mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object Arthur Sailes battling scorned wives and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben dead behind the eyes Sheets struggle for marital equality. As a libertarian I believe gays should have a right to get married. Ben & Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes. The portrayal of all things Christian are so ugly and ham-fisted trademark Mraovich that you can't possibly take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother Victor the bible toting Jesus freak is so horribly over-the-top evil/effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role. That's because Sam multitasking Mraovich was also casting director. The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself. When you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind? Sam also delivers lines like domino's pizza cold and usually wrong. The final tally: you suck at writing directing acting and casting. That's the Ed Wood quadruple crown. Congratulations you horrible little man. ",negative
" This movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I've lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people don't have a southern accent here. This movie is about a guy who does meth and I don't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about. It has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar. I lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug. The movie makes it look cool to use the drug but I was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line. I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day. The movie is just wrong in all directions. I would suggest The Basketball Diaries if I was going to suggest a movie about drugs. ",negative
" It's not the most well made slasher movies of all time but for what it is it's pretty amusing. The plot is lame but the kills are not too bad. I have to be honest if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film you wont find this film as funny as those who do. I knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin' with friends backstage...it's not made to be taken seriously. It's ubber cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills most of which are ultra gory it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch drink and be merry! ",negative
" ..Oh wait I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions like continuity editing and geographic match . I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff and by b-movie I mean BAD movie then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni though just skip this one. ",negative
" This movie was recently released on DVD in the US and I finally got the chance to see this hard-to-find gem. It even came with original theatrical previews of other Italian horror classics like SPASMO and BEYOND THE DARKNESS . Unfortunately the previews were the best thing about this movie. ZOMBI 3 in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous Lucio Fulci ZOMBIE franchise which began in 1979. Similarly compared to ZOMBIE ZOMBI 3 consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this 'horror' trash barely afloat. The gore is nearly non-existent (unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces) and the English dubbing is a notch below embarrassing. The plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists (ie. an idiotic male and his stupid female side-kick) who are developing some sort of chemical called Death One that is supposed to re-animate the dead. Unless my ears need to be checked I don't even recall a REASON for the research of Death One . It seems to EXIST only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star' in this cinematic laugh-fest. Anyway Death One is experimented on a corpse (whom I swear looked like Yul Brynner) and after it is injected into his system he sits upright and his head explodes! The sound effects are also quite hilarious - as the corpse's face bubbles with green slime the sound of 'paper crumpling' can be heard. The Death One toxin is transported outside and is 'hi-jacked' by a group of thieves where one makes off with it but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial. Needless to say the guy turns into a zombie but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror(!). The military catch wind of this and immediately take action before 'eliminating' everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the 'contamination zone' and turn the motel upside down. They find the infected thief and burn his body only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack(!). We cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army listening to 'groovy music' that is coming out of a little dinky boom-box while trailing a trailer-load of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests. Can someone say zombie food ? We also have a sub-plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road... the same birds that were infected by the 'zombie' smoke! The birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water. This is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie. She walks around this old dirty rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud HELLO? IS THERE ANYONE HERE? PLEASE I JUST NEED SOME WATER! She encounters a group of zombies one of which is chained to a wall (!) and the other is swinging a machete. After a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter. Meanwhile the birds attack the trailer-load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected. They all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place. After a matter of hours (a day at the most) the same motel is now caked in dust has vines growing throughout it and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years. Anyway what better place to take refuge than this particular building? Needless to say the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack. The third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village of which the woman comments THIS PLACE IS A DUMP! She then proceeds to get 'pushed' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna(?) infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds! Meanwhile her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected HOURS earlier is still TURNING into a zombie! Unfortunately there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words. For example the time rate concerning infected people being 'zombified' differs greatly. Sometimes it takes seconds other times it takes hours. Some zombies run others drag their feet and walk really slow. Some even do kung-fu moves while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people. Some of the zombies even talk! The funniest moment of course is the infamous 'zombie head in the fridge' gag which 'elevates' itself in mid-air and 'attacks' a stupid man who goes looking for food. Funnily enough his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it's 'headless' counter-part (LMAO!). The biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story-lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies. We never get to see them come back as zombies in fact the only ones we do see 'zombified' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off. Other than that I was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and/or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies. It is also amazing that these zombies only take a 'few bites' and then move on to their next victim. The most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital. A woman who seems to have a lot of 'medical knowledge' tries to deliver the baby (!) and has her face pulled off by a zombie before having her head pushed into the woman's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off. Timeless! As usual all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. The megalomaniacal military officer the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed the obvious characters who are ABOUT to get killed (ie. watch for the man chasing a chicken!) I guess this movie really is a comedy. There were many laughable scenes such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade (obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent) and a climatic scene where a man screams I'M THIRSTY.... THIRSTY FOR YOUR BLOOD! . The costumes are really bad - the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film wearing the same 'Asian-like' clothing that may be found in a Bruce Lee film and watch out for the blue 60's skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man. The end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story-line. A radio DJ who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the 'beginning of the end' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. Hardly DAWN OF THE DEAD material if you ask me. Regardless this movie does deliver many laughs. The gore is minimal and what gore there is it is very unconvincing let alone unimaginative. The usual mix of black blood thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and 'zombie make-up' consisting of green moss. ZOMBI 3 makes for a good rental for a sleep-over party or a night of beer and popcorn. Other than that horror fans should stay away. 3 out of 10 ",negative
" i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan(releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture) it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences.So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction.Give us more of herapheri's and malamal weekly's rather than giving duds like garam masala!

" Another American Pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all. It doesn't deserve the name American Pie. They should have stopped at The Wedding . This movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title American Pie on. When i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series. It doesn't fell like American Pie at all. It has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other American Pie movies. I don't recommend it ever. Actually i don't recommend any of the American Pie Presents movies. Just stick with the nice original trilogy. 2/10 ",negative
" If you make it through the opening credits this may be your type of movie. From the first screen image of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background one recalls a pretentious perfume commercial. It's all downhill from there. The lead actress is basically a block of wood who uses her computer to reach into the past and reconstruct the memories of photographs to talk history's overlooked genius Ada who conceived the first computer language in the 1800s. The low budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting or even somewhat integral to the script. Poor Tilda Swinton is wasted. ",negative
" I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made ...and simply is. It's one-and-a-half hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since it's a horror-movie. And I (usually) like horror-movies. I've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. It's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque. It's so lame it even gets boring and really quick too. The worst thing (if the above wasn't bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras. But (again this too) serves no end whatsoever. In the Blair Which sure enough there's an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this film there's no other explanation than: Hey ya'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!! The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying. Also no effort has been made to make anything any better sound-wise or other wise. Than finally there's the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock... My advise: Don't watch this under ANY circumstances. ",negative
" It's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments what's so difficult about capturing the robbers? Just eliminate the bank workers see who was at the bank-from all the cameras' footage angles-prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. Where is the suspense every body is talking about? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door... seen it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting. The Movie is not worth it. Pronto! ",negative
" I love Jane Austen's stories. I've only read two of them (P&P and S&S) but after having seen this adaption I'm reaching for Persuasion from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story and also because I refusing to believe Jane Austen could have written such nonsense. For me I thought that if you base a film on a Jane Austen novel you can't really go wrong. It will turn out great pretty much by default. I was wrong. First of all where are the characters that you sympathise with and like? You have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them and this did not deliver. Sure I wanted Anne and Wentworth to get together but only because that's what you know the purpose of the story is them getting together. Instead I had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the TV and to continue watching it to the end. Anne was utterly annoying throughout and in the end I really have no idea why Wentworth was so smitten by her as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to. She was meek bland dull socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone else's instructions rather than having a mind of her own. This can still work for a lead character if you do it well. This wasn't done well. The other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism of which Mary was the worst with a full-blown narcissistic personality disorder. Where Mrs. Bennet in P&P had similar flaws she was still endearing whereas Mary was more of a freak-show. More loathsome than funny. Wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy. For the most part of the story I was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he's in love with Anne as surely he's the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more... alive? Acting-wise not too much to say as I reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good/bad the people acting were. Anthony Head was excellent but as soon as I saw he was in it I expected no less. Also found the story very confusing. It wasn't until the end of the movie where it seemed as if Elizabeth was not Anne's stepmother but in fact a sister (I'm still not 100% on that). The whole Anne/Wentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy. They had been together but then broke up and they're both bitter about it? How come? I was wondering this for quite some time and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone? But it was said in a kind of by the by way that it was almost missed as if it was somehow unimportant. How can it be unimportant when it's the very core of the story?? There was also a lot of name-dropping but no real feel for who the characters were. This Louisa person for instance who was she? A friend? Family? What? It wasn't made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another. Lady Russell was there a lot but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister which felt very unrealistic as Mrs. Croft looked old enough to be his mother. The final kiss yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street but I didn't really think about it because I was too busy yelling GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!! at the TV because Anne's lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met Wentworth's. Have SOME hesitation there but only for a couple of seconds or so not half a minute. Then there's the issue of camera work. As a regular movie watcher you don't pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it. I didn't decide to do so here but I still noticed them. To me that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job. A lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups something that should only be used when there's a really important point to be made. In this adaption it was over-used and therefore lacked meaning. The hand-held feeling on occasion also didn't really work in a period drama. The camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary. (Not to mention the running itself.) This was the only Austen adaption I caught in ITV's Austen season. Makes me wonder if it's worth watching Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park or if I should just read the books and leave it at that. I'm sad to say this is a Jane Austen adaption I did not enjoy. Maybe I'll watch the 1995 version instead. The BBC are renowned for having done beautiful Austen adaptations before after all. ",negative
" Summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the hottest movie of the week given 99.9% of the screens dedicated to screening it. OK so I may exaggerate on the percentage but you get my drift. Besides stuff from Hollywood Bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown I'm hyped to watch them too. Tashan was billed as one of THE most highly anticipated for 2008 but I was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas. When I watched Jodha Akbar it was a full house but it wasn't for Tashan. After watching it I knew why. It was entertaining but it was fundamentally weak. Just like it's literal English title which means Style Tashan is all style but little substance. Not that it doesn't have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some bordered on a tad ridiculous even for Bollywood standards I must say. Which is quite surprising given that Tashan is directed and written by Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote Dhoom and Dhoom 2 both of which I enjoyed tremendously. In his rookie directorial outing with Tashan while you can't fault his direction you'd probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best. It tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a Thai action movie with Hong Kong's wirework and Hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil. And in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a Dhoom 2 homage was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere. At best Tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters. Saif Ali Khan plays Jimmy Cliff a call center executive who gives English tuition only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material. His playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with Pooja Singh (Kareena Kapoor) who's not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured hottie. She engages Jimmy's services for her boss mobster Bhaiyyaji (Anil Kapoor) who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken English and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it. And to complete the quartet Akshay Kumar plays Bachchan Pandey an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by Bhaiyyaji to hunt down Jimmy and Pooja when they escape with money stolen from Bahiyyaji's business. So begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on. Jimmy Cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero executing moves that would shame Rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character. Kareena Kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee. Every character has a backstory created and I thought Akshay Kumar's Bachchan Pandey was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green Incredible Hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches. His wounds also heal automatically which impressively puts Wolverine to shame. And the best part is his theme song which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversaries. But sad to say that's the only tune that is memorable something that cheers Bachchan- Pandey-Bachchan-Pandey . For most Bollywood movies I watch I will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from screenings humming a tune or two. I wasn't able to do that after Tashan because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all. Usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location. That I enjoy versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain or atop jagged rocks on the beach front. Tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously but coming from Vijay Krishna Acharya's story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well. Billed as a blockbuster now I can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one. Despite Akshay Kumr stealing the show Tashan could have been better on the whole. ",negative
" SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little dumb minded. It's NOTHING like SNL it's just a stupid piece of crap. Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries his hardest and people think he's funny. Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was decently funny with Andy was the pool part. They could have made the Quiet place a lot better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes. The part where he's pronouncing his H's more is retarded. They try going with it too long and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while he acts...he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie. This movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy. Which is about half the United States. ",negative
" Dark Rising is your typical bad obviously quickly produced horror/sci-fi/fantasy movie. It has a strange unexplained plot with holes so big you could fit an elephant through them. Most of the time I didn't know what the hell was going on but it didn't really matter it was a simple demon hunter returns from hell dimension to save campers story with confusing stuff added on about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and characters who make no sense or disappear totally for no reason. The acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script I am guessing. There is a couple topless scenes which is probably the only reason this bad movie got made (like so many other bad movies). Give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on T.V. ",negative
" William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in playing several different roles to convince him to come home. The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However it appears his acting is still OK. I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. Overall it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system it would receive a D . ",negative
" I was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget movie. The most glaring absurdity was that while the American inmates in a North Korean POW camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine going without bathing shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas and sleeping on bare floors and - let's not forget enduring torture - they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair. With the exception of a suitably austere-looking Harry Morgan as an army Major the casting and acting are simply awful. Ronald Regan cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. A mostly Caucasian cast portraying the North Korean camp officers might have been forgivable but when supposedly Russian officers acting as advisors to the Koreans strut around wearing re-badged Nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots (obvious costume-department recycles from WWII flicks) and speaking with accents like General Burkhalter from Hogan's Heroes well that's just six kinds of silly. Don't waste your time on this one. ",negative
" A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a DVD casing from his ***. I got quit excited by the prospects of an other Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great but boy was I wrong. First off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so. I imagine the castings went something like this. Tell me do you like fish? Yes I enjoy fish very much. Wonder full you're hired. Have some money. Than there is the script. I have read Chabon who I hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one-liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out. This is an actual line from the movie; If you tell me something that you've never said out loud to anyone before than this moment becomes unique! Unique? Does it? Does it really? Off course not you plank. Please pass me the Imodium. I'll have a whole ****ing strip. The directing is... well. I've got nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something. Stick to directing comedies. No stick to directing commercials. This movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age. I give it 2 stars because I don't wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star movie.

" The film attempts to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also the film purports to be about finding real love in Los Angeles but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first big movie.  ",negative
" After watching this on the MST3K episode I have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run Farenheight 451 Final Sacrifice and at least several others. At one point I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. I wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot. like the fact that even though gas is unavailable there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an F1 race car going all the way across the country.

" This movie is so awful it is hard to find the right words to describe it! At first the story is so ridiculous.A narrow-minded human can write a better plot! The actors are boring and untalented perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy Film. The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie. I should feel ashame because I paid for this lousy Picture. Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-) ",negative
" ... mainly because Ju-on 2 boasts an outrageous FORTY minutes' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first Ju-on - and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes that leaves you with 36 original minutes' worth of film. Ho-hum. I found that deeply irritating - as if viewers simply wouldn't remember the same stuff! - not to mention dull having to watch it all over again. OK that complaint aside the byline for Ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie which frankly over 36 minutes simply doesn't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original's highly convoluted storyline. There are however some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been had it had some time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original - some but not all - are answered. So in conclusion - if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story go for it - but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast-forward button for forty minutes.

" Land of Plenty is not a film. It is a tombstone for the directorial career of German Director Wim Wenders. Many felt it in The Million Dollar Hotel and now Land of Plenty makes it perfectly clear; not only has Wenders lost it he's actually turned into a BAD director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes. One might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but Wenders' case is extreme. It's as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again - only to get sloppish results. In a few words this film does not deserve your time. ",negative
" Warning: This review contains a spoiler. Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note I said almost . This is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CANNOT call them heroes ) shoot innocent bystanders for their food and also rob same for similar reasons. There's also tons of homoeroticism which was a turnoff for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on but miraculously recovers adding another 70 minutes of audience-torture.) I can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination. If you're in a MST3K mood you might find this watchable but for the most part you can forget it. Go rent the original Conan DVD instead. ",negative
" On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose California) all five (mind you three of us hardcore Kamal fans) of us had reached a unanimous verdict; VV was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up Monday. Not to mention we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year. I won't blame Kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something like Tamizh Cinema'la Photography Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Screenplay Direction Acting'la innum namba munnera'la (Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of Photography and Editing but we have hardly improved when it comes to Screenplay Direction and Acting ). While you're watching VV those words ring very true. Now here are the 10 Reasons to hate this movie: 1. Harris Jeyaraj 2. Harris Jeyaraj 3. Harris Jeyaraj I'm barely holding myself from using expletives here but fact is HJ has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his (remember 'Anniyan' 'Ghajini') with the jarring cacophony he bills as background music. The next time I have an eardrum transplant he's paying for it. 4. Songs Neither do the songs help move the movie's narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice. The film feels like it's made of four VERY long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them. 5. A Short gone too far. VV at best is fit to be a short story not a 2 hour plus thriller . To use a cliché here like the Energizer bunny it goes on and on and on; only in this case you don't want it to. The later part of a movie feels like a big drag. 6. Kamal-Jothika pairing Two ice cubes rubbed together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing. There's no reason you would root for them to make it together. In fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie they make a good irritant to the narration. Hate to say this but Kamalini Mukerjhee's 10 minute romancing does more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this movie plus 'Thenali'. 7. Kamal Haasan's accent Kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in India or in the US; and it isn't new either. He's been doing it since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It's simply gets on the nerve. Imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the US. He doesn't leave it at the Immigration either he offers doses of advice to his men (bewildered TN Cops from Keeranor Sathoor and beyond) in chaste Kamanglish ( Wha we hav here is plain bad police wok ) of course with nauseating effect. 8. Logic There are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale. Gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the Department of common sense. Which D.C.P in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after! The scene inside the theatre was so bad towards the climax; we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the Hero's IQ. Is he stupid can't he just use his Siren or Lights? (On a busy Madras road Kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-Jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude!). Can't he just use his gun? ( The guy on a bike starts on foot and we have a fully geared Kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time). I'm not voting in favour of the later but I'm just trying to explain the mood inside. 9. Gore & Violence If I wanted to watch women being raped their throats getting slashed more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity I would sit at home and rather watch a Police Report or Kuttram . The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story not overwhelm it! Somewhere down the line Gautum seems confused about what the extensions (rapes murders) are and what the mainstay (story) is! 10. Even a double shot Espresso couldn't get the pain out of the head.

" It's a poor film but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the least and I personally thought she was kind of cute. Too bad she only appears in one other film in the database. Besides that the film is filled with laughable gore and fakey death scenes. People get stabbed and they GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But if you like to watch poor horror films I recommend this one highly. ",negative
" I am still shuddering at the thought of EVER seeing this movie again. I have seen action films I have even liked quite a few of them but this one goes over the top. Not only does it have the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it. Furthermore the plot has no real twists at all a three year old kid could guess what comes next. It is a set of cliches (of action genre) with Sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). Now there is an actor who can't act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his basic face. I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding but then... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are magnificient but then... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas so you can see better sights that way rather than waste time on this flick. Go watch some other movie instead there are hundreds even thousands better action movies. ",negative
" Hey everyone... There really isn't much to say for this movie at all. The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work. After picking up a girl on the way there things start going badly wrong for all of them. The storyline alone (written by the actor playing Brandon I believe although I could be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing and is acted out accordingly. The Clown Killer himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark mysterious but most of all intelligent predator we are instead offered a rather clumsy nursery rhyme-singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis. The only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film (the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things). In short this film falls below every possible set standard. Admittedly I was sharing a few beers with a close friend as I watched this so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that S.I.C.K did fall just shy of a two rating. However in reality (and with the benefit of hindsight) the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film. 1 star out of ten. ",negative

" this film is terrible. The characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent. The plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe-worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing. In fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that in fact the writers probably never went to high school. The acting in most cases was weak too although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable. having said that the sound track was OK and the cinematography was nice in places (although the editing was poor).

" In short this movie is completely worthless. The idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future. An interesting idea but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief so the idea just flops. Apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed. But as a graphics person the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening. The color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality. And I don't understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking. If anything the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics -- they don't measure up even to the ancient Jurassic Park graphics. The models for the robots were so simple plain and very uncompelling. There were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric-like animals on that island but they are not explained in any way. The story is horrible beyond belief. In fact I can't believe I didn't just walk out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception. Why is the Morris Paley character even there? We are not in any way convinced that Joe is heroic -- I mean he flies a plane and saved one person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yeah there's a great hero for you. Dex has very little screen time so why are we supposed to care about Joe wanting to save him? Who were the Nepalease that locked Joe and Polly in the mine vault and why would they do it (remembering that the entire Totenkopf operation was robotic)? Plot holes: (1) Why did Bai Ling's character (a major fall from her excellent character in The Crow ) halt the robots who had captured Joe? They were looking for the vials and had not found them. (2) Why in the hell would Dex be captured but not killed (he doesn't have or know about the vials and the bad guys didn't know that Polly had the vials and was connected to Joe and therefore to Dex)? (3) Polly indicates that they don't know anything about Totenkopf yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete FBI-style file on him. (4) The blank spot on the map as described by the Nepalese -- if they know all about this mysterious area then why the hell is their map blank in that spot? (5) At one point Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) -- Joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes yet Polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress then in the same line of continuity suddenly Polly has her original clothes back. *sigh*. How far off am I supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap? We are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen. And the acting? We're supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad British accents? Which character isn't annoying? I think Ling Bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie (she doesn't have a single line). The dialogue wasn't camp and doesn't even rise to the level of cheese. Its just bad and annoying. These people aren't hero's or compelling; they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life. I can't believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on IMDb. IMHO it should be competing with Batman Forever in the bottom 100 of all time. ",negative
" As usual I was really looking forward to a new TV/film on a favourite subject of mine - makes a nice change from a *strangely familiar* documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel. I avidly looked forward to Pearl Harbour and Enemy at the Gates - but was rudely brought down to earth with the realisation of the malevolent stupid-ifying power of Hollywood - and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe. So yet again I got excited about 'The Rise of Evil' especially as I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved as I've enjoyed his books. I can see why he quit. To quote some guy responsible for this rubbish: The Kershaw book was an academic piece he said. It was quite dry. We needed more incidents. Incidents? Are they totally nuts? Hitler's life cannot be said to be without 'incident' - yes Kershaw's two volume Hitler biographies were long and detailed but they were supposed to be. The thesis behind 'Rise of Evil' seems to be: Hitler was a very bad man - no he was a VERY bad man who HATED jews and just in case you miss this we're going to emphasise the fact in EVERY scene in the film. There was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time and why Hitler may have adopted the views and strategy he did. Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent 'Nazis - A Warning from History' - this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the Munich communist rising were Jewish and that this may have coloured his views on the subject - and his axiomatic linking of the jews with Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the Nazi era. But there was not much understanding to be done - the film-makers weren't going to go there so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway. We certainly don't get the fascinating fact that Kershaw alludes to which has Hitler briefly being a socialist/communist immediately after WW1. That would of course be far too complex for the film to handle and might even detract from the relentless 'he was very bad' mantra which bangs away incessantly. We know he was a bad man. However we also know that he was a mesmerising figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic and of course espoused some views like vegetarianism anti-alcohol and anti-smoking that many Guardian readers could agree with. He was also famously fond of animals hence why that wholly invented dog-flogging scene was so absurd. He was also from all the accounts I've seen a brave soldier in WW1. Whilst we saw him with his Iron Cross we never get to see how he won it (acts of bravery were not in the script needless to say). We also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences whilst Sassoon Owen Brook Remarque and so many others found it so repellent an experience. And again like the point above re the jewish/bolshevik link this is vital to anyone's understanding about the subject. Why did he love war so much? Why did he think it was always a good idea despite massive evidence to the contrary? Why didn't he care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did - but still drew the wrong conclusions. This film certainly didn't have anything of any interest to say on this either. As all too often these days the film is a classic example of 'making history relevant to the present' and inventing stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with 'the present' - which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denominator where you don't trust your audience an inch so you just ram stuff down their throats knowing (sadly correctly) that you'll always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the world. History is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present for better and for worse. This rubbish was a great opportunity lost again. They spent millions on it and the locations and large scenes were impressive but told us nothing at all we didn't know already and promoted no understanding of this dark period in human history.

" One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting was terrible both for the kids and the adults. Most to all characters showed no little or not enough emotion. The lighting was terrible and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot (In the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed there's 4 shots; The sheriff and Dad in the evening on their boat Jillian and Molly in the evening swimming the rest of the kids in the daytime *when it's supposed to in the evening* at the river bank and the doctor Beatrice and Simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat.) The best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff Cappy (Although there's a slip of character when the pulse detector *Whatever that thing is when people die it beeps* shows Cappy has died he still moves while it can still be heard beeping and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually then it shows the pulse again and THEN he finally dies.) I guess it's not going to be perfect since it's an independent movie but it still could be better. Not worth watching honestly even for kids. Might as well watch something good like The Lion King or Toy Story if you're going to see anything you'll remember. ",negative
" This miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film. They should have let it remain that way. What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and Bette Grable sings with a chorus- What I'll Do to that Hungarian! The ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now let's fast forward to 300 years later where Grable just married to the Count Romero faces a similar situation when on her wedding night there is an invasion by Hungarian soldiers. Romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases Fairbanks. The ending is worse than the entire wretched film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news-an enraged Romero has annulled the marriage. This poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948. As Harry Davenport a veteran supporting player who is in it died in 1949; this must have been his last film. What a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career. Walter Abel co-stars but he can do little with such poor writing. The costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age. I can't fathom what Fairbanks was wearing. ",negative
" Celia Johnson is good as the Nurse. Michael Hordern is good as Capulet though it's his usual neighing and whinnying and not a patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Friar Laurence though he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt in the first of his yuk roles that would make him famous. Christopher Strauli's Benvolio is sympathetic. The sets are pretty if not stunning as in some of the other BBC Shakespeare's. And that's it. The rest is weak to dreadful. Rebecca Saire turned 15 during production and hasn't a clue about how to act Juliet - she opens her eyes real wide and whines every line in exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is poorly matched to her and his self-regard is inexplicable. The Balcony Scene flows smoothly and uneventfully with zero emotional or erotic impact. Their deaths come as a relief. If I had a dagger I would have offered it to them hours earlier. Anthony Andrews is unspeakable as Mercutio a great shock if you remember his fine work in Brideshead Revisited. He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each and then shouts the fragments in as disconnected and unintelligible manner as possible. In this production Queen Mab abdicates. Awful. The director Alvin Rakoff shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening brawl is notably incoherent. However there is humor when in a later fight Romeo apparently knees Tybalt right in the cobblers. Tybalt then grabs the offended region. However did that get through? R&J is a long play. This version is not recommended for classroom use or much else. ",negative
" So Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs snakes lizards tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles and mud not only daily but with enthusiasm. He was never able to make ME want to do it but he managed to make his wife come close. This movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled have a migraine or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity (currently well populated by Disney films). It's too noisy. Well Steve is too noisy. He's just so happy all the time and would cut right through the blasé' teenager (I can hear it now: that movie was so STUPID ) or the Tylenol with codeine. I'd say his enthusiasm is catching but if it was I would own a room full of snakes and that hasn't happened yet. I agreed they're beauties but I'm still not going to pet them. Plot was indeed predictable. Bad guys were so bad for a minute there I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore. But the movie was filled with animals and Steve and Terri which is why I watched it. That plot (if you could call it that) was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck. My expectations were low and stayed that way. I was hoping though that there would be a bit of a sequel where Steve and Terri (having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still can't believe we won't see Steve anymore. I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and the discovery channel at least. I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is. Crikey! ",negative
" I saw this movie once and I thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said Watch it again it's better . So I did. And to my surprise it was WORSE on the second time! There's a word limit so I'm going to get the ball rolling here. -The bombing scenes were all so stupid. Why on earth would anyone WAIT to trigger the explosion??? -None of the characters here are even remotely likable. Not on the first time not even the second. -Oh and last time I checked a car does not explode from a single gun shot nor can a fire THAT huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher... did the above 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie??? -The camera is so shaky I can barely tell what is going on. That opening scene with the robot had my stomach off-put the rest of the movie was not much better. -The sniper scene. The McManus Brothers (from The Boondock Saints ) would roll their eyes it was so stupid. First off why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot? Furthermore why would he spend THAT much time cleaning the bullets reloading aiming and NOT get shot when there was so much chaos going on around him? -SAS types RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back?????? Huh????? Are the soldiers... gay...??? I didn't mean to sound homophobic but honestly that scene was so ridiculous. -Too long for its own good yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it. Bigelow seems to think that the more action the better. Looks like she is wrong- the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know Watchmen is longer at 163 minutes but at least that movie didn't drag. This movie on the other hand does and for it feels longer. The only good thing was Renner who was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favour just skip this and don't give into the hype. ",negative
" Some films are so bad that they're good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story this film was about as true to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible the direction was poor and it travelled way too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home. Nor did Melissa Joan Hart ever strike me as a talented actress but then every film she made was pretty low-budget anyway. Like most of her other films she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic. She really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she's talking to a camera when she should be engaging the viewer in her character. It pretty much lets down the whole film and any leg that it may have had left to stand on is ruined. Probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end. But even that wasn't satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad film. Watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast. ",negative
" To be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat now. maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too.. To say this was awful is to do this film a mis-service if you want to see something that is totally execrable you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching 'sickle' that is soo mind numbingly awful its actually good (several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though. Any road up I enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet just don't expect anything along the lines of 'jurassic park the lost world' or 'apocalypto'. ",negative
" This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. It's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen - each one with no apparent connection to the next. I rented this movie because I'm a David Bowie fan and I really appreciate musicals. In finality Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. The moral of the story was really befuddling. I couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling out. For the first half of the movie I was chuckling at how cheesy it was but I liked the campiness of the no selling out message. When blacks started being murdered I thought my tape had gotten messed up. Maybe I rented half of two different movies? Nope there was a Keep Britain White song and dance sequence. I'm sorry but WWII is not something you can write a musical about. At least not a musical that could conceivably be described as campy as I have several times in this review. Overall I'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors. (And put David Bowie in it for longer goddammit!) My grade: C- ",negative
" I'm a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That being said I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I've seen in some time. To have a good movie you need to have a well-written screenplay. Left Behind fell woefully short on this. For one thing it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour film but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever. Another thing there is zero character development. When characters in the story get saved (I won't say who) the book makes it clear that it's a long soul-searching process. In the film it's quick and artificial. The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind (again I won't say who) it seems artificial. I realize as a Christian it's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film but I can't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done. Perhaps it would've been better to make the first book into 2-3 films. Either way Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way. I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind but that's the way I see it. ",negative

" Life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers. Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for; but to be effective they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round. The first such work to become really widely known was probably George Orwell's 1984 (first published in 1948) and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film. Watch or read it: and then when you are feeling a little depressed by man's inhumanity to man reach for Cinderella 2000. This is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period. Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments. To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption. There are many worse films appearing as DVD's these days and frankly I do not care much what happens either way. So far the best of the films of this genre has probably been The Handmaiden's Tale but I would very happily swap them all for a well made film of Jack London's towering novel The Iron Heel . Ambitious as this would be it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it (IMDb only lists a B/W silent version made in Russia in 1919). ",negative
" This movie was poorly written poorly acted and very predictable. It was very low-budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video. It wasn't even campy fun it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1/2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them. The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this. ejames6342 ",negative
" This movie was boring! Yes there are a few funny moments and jokes but you cannot base a whole movie on that! The characters are too stereotyped there is no real story - but short episodes with freaky side-characters who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine. Shame because most of the actors are acknowledged in Hungary a mystery why they took the roles. This is *not* a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring though it was meant to be genuine or unique. They could have tried much more harder than this... 2 out of 10 ",negative
" Except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads this movie is really really bad. The cheap production values don't help. Of course you wouldn't really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn't keep trying to convince you they HAD a production values to begin with. Even for a B-movie genre freak like myself this movie really sucks. ",negative
" Let me just say I loved the original Boogeyman. Sure it's a flawed clichéd 80s horror movie but hey those types are fun to watch! And plus it gave us something a bit different. So I gladly bought it and to my surprise this movie came along with it (only copy they had actually) so I thought Eh what the hell and bought it. Mistake #1. So that night I felt in the mood to watch a movie (I actually bought tons that day) and figured this was the shortest out of all the ones I bought so I'll just watch this and hit the sack. Mistake #2. Yes I have heard how bad it was but I was willing to take a chance. So a few minutes into the movie and there's the first flashback. I think nothing of it at first. Then the new footage with the prediction of the chick in the bathtub and I'm kinda liking the direction it's going in. Then the next flashback which is a bit longer and I'm sitting there thinking Yes I've seen the first Boogeyman! I know what happens so move along! Then the next one comes up and I figure screw it and fast forward through it. Then the final one (Maybe I fast forwarded through the explanation but why was she lying topless on the mirror? At least she could've shown them!) and I decide to fast forward through it and then the climax and the movie was over! WTF? What happened to the prediction stuff? What happened to the long hair dude (Did he tap that or what?)? And more importantly what kind of weed was the writer and director smoking when making this awful POS??!!! And what was the point? Was Annie just having flashbacks of what happened in the first movie? Or was the stuff from the first movie just happening at the same time as this? The latter could make sense because the stabbing of Pantyhose Face happened in 1978 according to the characters in this movie and it was 15 years later. Wait a minute no it wouldn't! Because Lacey (who the movie questionably renamed Nancy! Is Uli too dumb to remember his movie characters' names?) would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks 30ish but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10! Did she get around during middle school? And also why would Pantyhose be after Annie? What connection does she even have with the characters of the original movie? And a BIG HUGE MOVIE MISTAKE I found in this movie is that when the doctor is writing in his notebook does anyone notice that he's just SCRIBBLING? Wow how professional Doc! So what is the explanation for all of the questions I asked above? IT'S A POINTLESS MOVIE WITH NO THOUGHT PUT INTO IT AT ALL! I will try to find a copy of the original movie that comes with just that movie and that's it (Maybe a couple of extra features any Special Edition of it yet?). Then I will return this DVD and hopefully this review and all the others will prevent those who haven't seen it from seeing it thus making movie stores get rid of it and this movie may not exist anymore! Please let that be so! Sorry this review is so long. I'm just angry at this movie I had to vent somehow ",negative
" I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a pile of steaming poo this movie is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back???? Finally someone bumped Stop-loss from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair I don't think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway but this was REALLY bad. I won't get into any technical inaccuracies there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the credit for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though.....WTF???? I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that the plot sucks characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is poor at best. It's ironic I suppose that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year. ",negative
" I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Just terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hater.) and I had high expectations for this one since I found it listed on many 10 Best Kung Fu/Martial Arts Movies websites. (I'm now convinced that those 10 Best lists are all cut-and-paste jobs.) First of all there's barely any action in the film. Most of the movie consists of talking about the plot which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best. And the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978 but it's routine by today's standards. A special warning to Netflix users: the DVD they ship is terrible; the picture is horrendous and it's not even 16:9 enhanced. ",negative
" This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make since. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever. Don't watch this. If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror action and crime. Don't let your children watch this. Teenager young child or young adult this movie has that sorta impact upon people.

" I could not believe how awful this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV but thought Well Diane Keaton is always worth watching . I stand corrected. Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame. I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age but the script to this was so inept clichéd and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable. The acting looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering What were they thinking? . Very very sad that it has come to this. Don't waste your time. ",negative
" As has been noted this formula has been filmed several times most recently as You've Got Mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Trout Pout Ryan. Of the several versions this is my least favorite. The problem i think is that the studio coasted on the Stars charisma which doesn't quite cut it here. The chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day old donuts pleasant but bland. And when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it's head into it's shell all hunched up and everything. I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot about. I would have made a bee line for that cute violin player. And Van wasn't great either. I've always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image here. If you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900's then you might like this movie. But there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection. ",negative
" Justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside let's just take this movie as it's offered without extraneous explanations. This movie is God awful. Straight up craptastic. Rather than rehash what may serve as a plot I'll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head. A class (of 5) take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin' nowhere Ireland. These students may be Canadian or American it's difficult to tell. That it was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is rather obvious as well. One student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the dumb jock character from a number of kick ass 80's movie except when he channels Randy from Scream. One character may be Chris Klein's stunt double. He has a girlfriend who probably gets killed but it's never really established if that is true. One character is sullen and removed from her peers...just...cuz... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl. Ireland has a population of 2. They're cousins. Gary who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast is called sir more than once. He's very ominous and wears a knit cap. His cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst Irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond. Picturesque Ireland features many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes. The producers got a discount on volume fake entrails. Good for them. Unbeknownst to me horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives. Perhaps there's some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register. Also unbeknownst to me if you inbreed for roughly 600 years as the story leads us to believe happened you end up being somewhat lumpy yet amazingly spry and fairly strong. Genetics are a wonderful game of craps. There may or may not be more than one freak in this film. Reference is made to them and we see shadows yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever. And when one odd looking dude is finally killed apparently all danger is passed. I'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up thus they just used the one. That's what it looks like on screen anyway. Richard Grieco should be ashamed. Also of note aside from those shiny new knives the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear as once Richard Grieco cuts his bonds there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up...who also then escapes because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up. A dead body in a shack will be maggot-ridden after what I would guess is about 2 hours has passed. Said dead body will also have glasses on when no characters wore them. Curious. Jenna Jameson appears for no reason from stage left chats for 2 minutes vanishes stage left. In the middle of a giant forest. That's not unusual as Gary can also pop out of nowhere which is also known as whatever exists in TV land off the screen. Ms. Jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn't suck wind. I offer a special nod to the Breeder character the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua. The ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years. Apparently this wasn't just random crap I found on the movie network late at night apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it's production. How sad for you all. I have nothing more to say. May God have mercy on us all. ",negative
" Fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and strangely attractive. She resembles a deranged Renee Zellweger with a bad hair-do. This chick only made two of these films and then moved back to Texas. The music is terrible. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name. Best line in the film from Tony - Are you putting me on doll? None of my chicks put me on . Good B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locales (cool swimming pool also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange ending but fitting. A 4 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker. ",negative
" In an otherwise good review loleralacartelort7890 says The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation. This is completely incorrect. There is (and was) no secret to radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available. It uses a lightweight honeycomb of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except the windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re-entry. These materials are actually *better* at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like X-rays and gamma rays. Space radiation is a definite problem for *long term* space flight because of the risk of big solar flares. But it simply wasn't a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The Command Module gave them pretty good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so) passage through the Van Allen belts. They all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: no more than 1.5 rem and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon (12 of whom landed) 18 are still alive. Only two have died from cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died from heart attacks pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s (Shepard would be 86).

" This movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half-hour or so. None of them generate any interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing that. If you want a synopsis look elsewhere. To me the action isn't worth recounting. Not that the story was that bad I guess you could say I had some problems with the script--i.e. I thought it stunk. A look at the credits will show you that there's a pretty strong cast here used to no avail. Most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs; of the actors I hadn't seen much of before I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's about all that I can find good to say about this picture.

" This film was a disaster from start to finish. Interspersed with performances from the next generation of beautiful losers are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright's) or bland under-achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony got within striking distance of Leonard's own versions by using a little restraint. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film- like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots shaky blurred camera work use of digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen's comments (making it harder to hear what's being said) and a spooky pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments (an attempt at added gravitas?). For the real thing see the Songs From The Life Of documentary produced by the BBC in 1988. ",negative
" Pros: Nothing Cons: Everything Plot summary: A female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies. Review: Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks TZC is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening. How does a movie like this even get made? Simply put avoid TZC like a sexually-transmitted disease. My last 2 cents: Humorously enough this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. They're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this. My rating: 1 out of 10(If it were up to me this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion) ",negative
" Another great movie by Costa-Gavras. It's a great presentation of the situation is Latin America and the US involvement in Latin American politics. The facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the US was deeply involved in coups and support of Latin American dictatorships. Despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftist/communist propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased. For example he presents the US actions as brutal and inhumane while representing Tupamaros' extremist activities as something positive. As it turned out it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of the Latin America that the US got involved. Europe is filled with poor East European prostitutes. I never heard of poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse as it happens in most East European countries. The US was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of Soviet Communism was defeated. It is unfortunate the US had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere) but sometimes you need to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. Had Matamoros come to power in Uruguay we would've had another Ukraine in Latin America. All in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of times past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct. ",negative
" I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! Hilarious! Next thing you know the two women are going at it. Yep they're lesbians! Nothing rings true in this Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do movie. Clunky dialogue like I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didn't take it doesn't help. There's a wealthy distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003 a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! No cliche is left unturned. ",negative
" ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Continued... From here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself. First we meet a rogue program with the indication we're gonna get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like. We get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage two 'ghosts' that serve no real purpose and have no character what-so-ever and a bunch of henchmen. Someone's told me they're vampires (straight out of Blade 2) but they're so undefined I didn't realise. The funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the Oracle only for far longer and far far worse. He has a simple point about cause and effect makes it then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid. His final line before walking off is comparable to Storm's do you know what happens to a toad... line in X-men in levels of utter bland baddness. The chocolate cake is such a lazy pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her. And then we get another kung fu fight!!! WHY? Neo is allegedly The One. He can do anything. He has the ultimate power and what does he use it for. Kung bloody fu all the time. And while he can stop 1000 bullets he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see mind blowing powers. I wanted to see him do the wildest craziest most insane s*** to people because he can do anything. I got the same as before without the 'wow'. The fabled car chase. That can't be bad. Well... no it's not. It's just not what we've been tyold it was going to be. ALL the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer. Every one. So all possibly Wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with guess what a kung fu fight!!! OK it's not Neo but you'd have thought he'd have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix. At least taught them something. It's not hard. Hey Morpheus don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix. It's not real. As long as you understand that nothing's real then nothing can really harm you. There you go. Simple. OK so the chase is not bad. It's never boring and it doesn't seem like 16 minutes. It's just so underwhelming. And still it gets worse. The final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable. They have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews. They then only show it sporadically between Morpheus's over long super preachy monologue. To make it worse they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is. You know basically but you don't know who's doing what when so when one crew goes down you just don't care and you don't know how this is going to affect what goes on. I'll sum it up though it happens so Trinity can get back into the Matrix to setup the end. That's the only reason it happens. Which raises the question why did they need to send 6 people originally? Trinity gets in in five minutes by herself! Neo's journey to the centre of the Matrix (so to speak) is handled equally lazily. Ooohhh!!! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths!!! Woooooo!!! That must've taken a lot of thought. Only now they're in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment. Man what a grand finale!!! And then the Architect!!! Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy? Add them together and double it that's how truly appalling the Architect is. The only reasonable potential of him is he's about to set up the cliffhanging climax. And then he blows it! Let's look at the options he gives Neo. Choose one door and all humanity dies (except 27!!!). Choose the other and all humanity dies!!! Considering choice is something this film tries to explore it doesn't really give it's hero one. If he had a choice of Save humanity and the missus dies or Save the missus and kill humanity there's the potnetial for inner torment and tension. Also with Trinity being mid fall the potential of a real cliffhanger that would've made seeing the third more essential. But no. He has save no-one or save the missus. Now the very worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end. The year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was they didn't notice that the very end of The Matrix made him look him Steven Hawking. The Oracle told me I'd fall in love with the One and I love you .... Come On!!!! How can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was? So what do the Wachowski's do in the sequel? Well they make the ending of the original look better. How? Well by doing almost exactly the same thing again (only swapping characters) only so much worse I think my f a and r keys would be worn out if I kept writing far before I got to worse. And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. Basically this film is just bad. I really didn't want it to be bad but it is. Bad in just so many ways. And to make matters worse this isn't a film with not enough budget. It's not a film with too short a schedule. It's not a film that's been rushed out. It's not a film where too much influence has come from the outside. This is exactly the film the Wachowski's set out to make with Warner's fortune fully behind them. And that's what makes this so awful. At least Rancid Aluminium can say that it didn't haev enough time or money. Matrix Reloaded. The worst film ever made? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and defalting film ever made. Undeniably. ",negative
" This movie could have been so much better especially considering the talent. Larenz Tate's portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good especially in musical performances. He doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are Larenz Tate when he should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has Hollywood written all over it. The powers that be obviously pushed it but it only made the characters more unrealistic. The positives of the movie were Miguel Nunez's portrayal of Little Richard and the cameo of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is eye candy as usual even in a conservative role. It's too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this film was a wasted opportunity. ",negative
" Let me give a quick summery of the film: A rotten rude kid named Max stumbles upon a radio that contains Kazaam: a rapping genie. Like all genies he grants 3 wishes but being good natured also helps Max with his personal life as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime. During all this Kazaam raps from time to time (also showcasing Shaq's dismal rap skills). This movie proves what we all know: Athletes need to stick to sports. I admit that it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible. The characters are either unlikable or stupid the plot is not even worth mentioning the dialog is a joke and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke. I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big (no pun intended) at the time. I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time. Shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws. ",negative
" As some other comments show this movie might scare you when you're a little child. (And that is probably all that it is good for.) However if you're older this movie only does one thing: suck majorly -and thereby I don't mean the acting its soundtrack cutting or s.th. like that. I'm simply talking about the plot (if you can call it that). SPOILERS ahead ------------------------ I don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary (if after reading this you really still want to watch this movie) but if you graduated from any school this is just a big insult of your intelligence. When watching this I was stunned most of the time because what was happening was just THAT stupid. This includes: -the forming of UNITE (an evil UN-association) --> we are just supposed to believe it's evil. is it even evil at all? if so: why is it evil? -the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo --> there is no necessity to impose this on the people so why the hell (no pun intended) are they doing it? -inviting Christ to your heart merely as lip service -->because there's nothing anybody who in this movie is considered a real Christian ever does besides saying that stupid prayer. so...just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved - no matter what?! Thus rating 1/10 ",negative
" Hey Arnold! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. Hey Arnold the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie is about five times more sedated and a good way to put anyone including kiddies to sleep. Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel. ",negative
" I was really horrified by this eerie movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a creepy musical score. Really promising! Indeed after ten minutes you really start sweating and feeling uncomfortable for you start fearing the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare and what's worse-it all comes out. For one hour and a half I have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly horrifying picture - for your eyes your ears your intelligence and most of all: your wallet since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all.

" The only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches. (Moderate Spoiler Alert) Death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie which delivers death by cartoon. Still this was handled nicely especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out. Additionally there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle. Having said that I was glad I got the DVD cheap at a store going out of business sale because this was pretty awful. I bought Soul Survivors at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream. However where Soul Survivors has nothing to redeem it or have it make any sense this at least had a couple of stylish notes referred to above. Interestingly the DVD lets you go to the 8 'nightmares' where something actually happens which is the only way to watch this. The scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable. 3 out of 10. ",negative
" First before reading further you must understand that I'm not neo-nazi I'm just trying to understand correctly Hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again. I've seen this series and found it awful. I mean OK it's interesting to look but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First Hitler wasn't angry all his life the series shows an angry Hitler even when he is a child. Second Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter in fact it is highly probable that Hitler in reality was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret. Third people will hate me but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. That's a common point I found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him (of course not Jews). This series was awful because if you think that Hitler was just an angry bastard ugly and of course not charming at all you're wrong. If you think that you will let people like him take power in countries and you don't want that. If you really understand how Hitler managed to get into power and stop thinking he was just awful you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course remember he was elected) and stop theme before it's too late. Life is important to protect this series is just awful to show us the truth if we continue to see Hitler like that another one will take place exactly as the first did. ",negative
" Being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant Ed Wood actually was. What I got was a disappointing self-centered conflictive contradictory compilation of bitter self-aggrandizing has-beens. Where people DO remember Ed Wood Jr. do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the duct tape who knew someone who was in Plan Nine From Outer Space? It appears as though the very minute there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood these people come out of the Wood work! Only to take mean spirited swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when no-one else would! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they didn't get the $75 they were promised! Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. In-fact that was ALL he lived for. You may giggle when you see Ed's films but somehow you are aware that you are laughing WITH him and not AT him. But I digress... Back to the film at hand. If you are expecting a film ABOUT Edward D. Wood Jr. you won't get it here. If you want a film about cranky bitter old actors this is the film for you! ",negative
" I'm not a regular viewer of Springer's but I do watch his show in glimpses and I think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. So naturally I'm going to watch this movie expecting to see Jerry Springer Uncensored. First of all Jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's running time. The other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo-farce about trailer-trash jealousy incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer-trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather (a very unusual-looking chain-smoking drunken Michael Dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona). The mom finds out about the affair they get into a fight they want to take it to the Jerry show (that's right no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take it to the Jerry show. The characters collide. Blah blah freakin' blah! Trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG!!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans yet none of them checked out his movie. Well now it's TOTALLY obvious!! Whether you love him or hate him you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess of a motion picture (if that's what you call it). It's so badly edited with scenes that just don't connect and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the map! Just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce. With seldom laughs. My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. That's as risque as it gets. Don't get me wrong the scene's pretty risque but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on Springer's program--this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitized. My score: 3 (out of 10) ",negative
" SPOILERS HEREIN My High School did all they could to try and motivate us for exams. But the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker who was none other than Australian Kickboxing's favorite son Stan The Man Longinidis. The first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where I got really worked up. The guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no-one else. He was offered many deals in the past to give up kick-boxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming Australia's greatest kick-boxer. He said that he wasn't a sell-out he was happy and a retiree he wasn't ever involved in any other activity other than Kickboxing then he plugged his film. Yes you heard right he PLUGGED his new FILM. As he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called Trojan Warrior . (This all being before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his final career fight (for now)) Stan plays Ajax a kick-boxing ex-special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of Melbourne. Ajax's cousin Theo (Arthur Angel) recently sold out (well at least Stan didn't stray too far away from EVERYTHING) to the feds and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime. Ajax and Theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations from fighting in a Kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party. It's all pretty ridiculous but if Silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here this man should never be handed a camera again. I'll admit I was actually pumped to see this. I love action films even if they're corny and especially if it's set in my own backyard. But what I was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go and continued to do so after the words for the love of God please make it stop! subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely NO reason whatsoever and the most over-choreographed fight scenes that didn't even remotely reflect Stan's actual talent in Kickboxing. The cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone REMOTELY famous (Dermot Brereton Mark Chopper Read and Greg Matthews). The whole time you're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background. Too bad the movie relies heavily on split-second appearances by former celebrities. Remember those plot-holes I told you about? Ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in special forces via ONE single sentence in the WHOLE film and then leave it for buggery. This is followed by another SINGLE sentence which persuades Ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up. Then get this at the end it is revealed to Ajax that his wife isn't actually dead but was sold into prostitution. Do we see her? No. Does Ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this? No. Now THAT's a marriage! Amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap some website described this film as a cross between Jackie Chan & Guy Ritchie . Has this man ever sat down and watched a Jackie Chan film?! Chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than Stan did doing well ANYTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the crime-film Messiah and you're comparing him to Salik Silverstein!? This film is more like a mix between Pizza and Enter The Ninja . Now where do you thing the whole Trojan Warrior title comes from? Ajax's fierce fighting skills like that of an Ancient Greek Warrior? No. The gangsters' unification to find Theo like that of the Trojan Empire? No. It's because wait for it Theo carries a condom around with him. Yes that right because THEO is ALWAYS PREPARED with a Trojan BRAND RUBBER in his pocket he is a Trojan WARRIOR! I had the displeasure of seeing Trojan Warrior on DVD as well as it's special features:  Video clip of Chop Chop a rap song by Mark Chopper Read: Chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that ANYONE can rap. The funny thing was Chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from Doncaster using such words as dis and dope etc in their Australian accents. Face it people rap was developed in the States LEAVE IT THERE! The clip looked like something a Channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together.  Bloopers: There was no real difference between these and the actual film.  Stan The Man Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: This wasn't too bad considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage). I don't want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film but... oh wait I just did. My advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of Trojan Warrior tape them together and use it for a paperweight because this movie is just that damn bad. ",negative
" Half Past Dead starring Steven Seagal in the main role was a major B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something. It's less entertaining than the first one: in all aspects. But it's although worthy a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch former WWE stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels even if they are direct or not. Kurupt did a good job Bill Goldberg was below the average I think he isn't made to the job. Kurupt is a good comedian I say. The rest did the job but nothing amazing nothing far from alright. Technical details well a production made by Sony can't be great. Cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable. Whatever just watch it if you want. If you watch you won't lose anything. But if you don't... well you won't lose either. ",negative
" i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations. the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good right? how wrong i was. i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director/writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah)... well the director/writer of Edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i cannot see how he (along with the other actors in the film) would ever agree to be in this disaster. this movie is absolutely appalling! it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever. there is nothing new with Edison. the acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy. this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen. some examples of just bad silly moments in Edison... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music... justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird... 3 guys being shot in the head... this movie is the opposite of good. STAY AWAY FROM EDISON! ",negative
" Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10. Worst acting ever. No really worst acting ever. David Hess (Last House on the Left. No the one from the seventies. Rent it it's really good) is the worst of the bunch (Pretty stiff competition but he is amazingly god-awful.) One would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence. The film actually screeches to a stunning painful halt when he is on the screen. Not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities for Mr. Hess to ruin. It is filmed with a home movie camera and by the looks of things a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike. No post production either. Come on there has to be some shovelware a five year old computer could use that could clean up this picture. Throw in bizarre stock footage pictures of autopsy's and aircraft carrier takeoffs and this is one visually screwed up picture. The autopsy pictures are interjected the way Italian cannibal films interject those god-awful real life animal killings. And the Navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement (Cause we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy) What in the world is Lion's Gate is doing releasing this garbage? It would embarrass Troma. The plot is about the Zodiac Killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry . No the one from the seventies. Rent it it's really good) Somebody gets shot in the stomach in LA and the cops assume the Zodiac Killer is back? Uh-huh. What can you expect from a movie that doesn't know that DSM IV is a book not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer older man relationship resembles that of a congressional page and closeted congressman? Yeah eighties haircuts and production values meet a Nambla subplot. Sign me up. ",negative
" First of all Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie and she's just awful. This movie has every horror move cliché in imagination and all badly played. The over-sexed teen couple. The comical(not)horny jock. The snotty cool chick. The creepy local color guy. The parental-type couple. The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool. It's almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse. Sure the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog. Avoid at all costs. ",negative
" Carriers follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen Mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car. Brian (Chris Pine of Star Trek ) is driving and his girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo of Coyote Ugly )has shotgun while Brian's younger brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci of Fanboys ) and his friend--not exactly girlfriend--Kate (Emily VanCamp of The Ring 2 ) occupy the backseat. This quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare. Apparently a viral pandemic--which co-directors & co-scenarists Alex Pastor and David Pastor tell us absolutely nothing about--has devastated America. Naturally the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies. This lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die. Most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band. Initially this foursome encounters a desperate father Frank (Christopher Meloni of Runaway Bride ) and his cute little daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka of Land of the Lost ) blocking the highway with their SUV. Brian swerves around Frank when he tries to waylay them but in the process the oil pan in their Mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot. Reluctantly they hitch a ride with Frank after they seal Jodie up in the rear of the SUV. She wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood. Frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it. Sadly somebody has lied to Frank. The hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some Kool-Aid that will put them out of their misery. The cure did not improve their condition. Everybody else in town is dead. Kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone. Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his SUV and take off. Indeed Carriers qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves. They reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump-action shotguns. Incredibly our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot but Brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse. Eventually they discover that one of them has become infected. Later as they are about to run out of gas Brian blocks the highway like Frank did at the outset. Danny tries to stop a pair of older Christian women driving the car. Danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help. Brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them. Brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger but he kills her. No Carriers is not a beer & pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non-existent. By the end of this 84-minute movie our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight. Chris Pine makes quite an impression as fun-loving Brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum while the only other well-known actress Piper Perabo is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role. As Bobby she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price. It is a testament to Pine's performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others. Essentially Pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one-eighty from happy-go-lucky guy to heartless guy. The two directors are Spanish brothers and they never let the momentum flag. Since there is no relief in sight Carriers sinks into predictability. Irréversible cinematographer Benoît Debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes Debie makes it look like a dynamic film. Aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word Carriers suffers because it is so horribly cynical. The scene when the German shepherd attacks Danny conjures up the most suspense but even it could have been improved. Unfortunately the Pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense. By fade-out you really don't care what happens to anybody. ",negative
" It's funny when you stop and think about it: fright film fans tend to a deep and abiding affection toward those who scare the daylights out of them. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE may give us nightmares but who among us (the Faithful) didn't feel a very real twinge of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE- or for Ken Foree forever and ever the resolute hero of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD? His cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and cheer (as did Tom Savini's cameo); I kid you not. And Brian Halloran and... Well you get my drift (if not just stand downwind...). These are some of the Heroes of Horror. To see this many of them gathered together in a single movie is almost unheard of (at least to this degree to my knowledge). If only the writer(s) had been up to such a monumental task. Maybe someone else somewhere along the line will try again. As long as it's not another half-hearted effort (like BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD for instance). ",negative
" Ally McBeal was a decent enough show but it was very overrated. The characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short. I think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave - it was starting to outstay its welcome. ",negative
" Before watching this film I had very low expectations and went to just see the cars. Eventually I even regretted going for that reason. Plot is almost non-existent. Character development is non-existent. So many clichés and so much jaw-dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that I could only stare and wonder how it was even released. If not for the exotics I wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1. An attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members. In fact the movie's plot is so predictable and simple-minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline. Bad acting bad plot bad jokes bad movie. Don't see it. Play Gran Turismo HD instead and it'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste. ",negative
" This movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school. I have to give it credit on its campiness though. Many times throughout the movie I found myself laughing hysterically. It was so bad at times that it was comical which made it a fun watch. If you're looking for a low-grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness then pop a bowl of popcorn invite some friends over and have some fun. I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. Dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there. ",negative
" This film was absolutely awful I even feel uncomfortable calling it a film. Its the typical mumblecore movie with zero plot and a bunch of aimless whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to figure stuff out . I have tried to give mumblecore a chance but lets be honest its just horrible. I am not out of sync with cinema I appreciate Dogme95 films Idioterne is one of my all time favorite films. So I do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some (ANY) substance. Everything in this film is horrid the acting the writing (or was it all improvised?) the direction but MOST of all above everything else the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense. The camera was never anywhere logical there was no consistency. I got to admit being a guy I had heard there was nudity in this film so I thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there's nudity (yea I know I'm a jerk). Well thanks to the uber crappy camera-work you never really get to see anything and the things you do see TRUST ME - YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE. This film made me want to vomit on numerous levels. The dialogue made me want to vomit the camera-work made me want to vomit but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit.

" No this wasn't one of the ten worst films of the 1980's but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere. This movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else would you explain special effects pre-dating An American Werewolf in London disco still being considered cool and Ronald Reagan not being the 40th President of the United States? While we're at it let's not overlook those 1970's hairstyles in the 1950's and '60's. I've seen more of that here than in Happy Days & Laverne & Shirley combined. The one woman who elevates this movie to the so bad it's good category was the late great Elizabeth Hartman but just barely. Biff plays as Miss Montgomery the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot a stereotype that's been done to death and is still being churned out by Hollywood today but even as a hot chick she retains her mousey qualities. Her call for help is evidence of this. She also looks much better as Miss Wimp. Seven bucks at the beauty parlor shot to hell. She wasn't kidding. This isn't to say that there aren't any good parts elsewhere they're just few and far between and I'm not just saying that because I like Hartman. Incidentally Teen Wolf was better than this. Teen Wolf Too was better than this and that wasn't even so good. ",negative
" We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like. To say this film was incomprehensible boring pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it! How did people manage to sit through this confusing slow depressing pseud's corner of a film let alone nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh .. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? The film was hard enough to follow without that as well. I pity the cast who obviously did their best with the material available. ",negative
" I really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie. It's not bad enough to be hilarious. There's no sleaze or gratuitous nudity (although there was plenty of opportunity). There's no gore. There's no suspense in the first hour of the movie 'cause there's way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky tribal music. That last part was actually funny on many occasions: You see these natives hitting congas and 'jembés' and that's indeed what you hear (badly synchronized) on the soundtrack. But they also added this funky bass-line on the soundtrack. So where was the bass-player? At one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists. Why all of the sudden? It's supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the river-alligator-god (I actually missed the explanation for that one). But the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex so why the sudden angriness? And how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water??? It's all silly and pointless. This movie also features the skinniest Afro-American model I've ever seen. At one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird crazy old man lives. The only point to that scene is that they make the shocking discovery that the killer-crocodile is actually an alligator. Crocodile or alligator what's the difference? It's big it's made out of plastic and it eats people. All the same to me. The alligator is a rather silly creation. It's very stiff & motionless and doesn't even flap its feet when it swims. The eyes don't even move when they're shot in close-up. I guess they didn't know 'animatronics' back then in Italy during 1979. There's also a lot of pointless inter-cut shots of the local wildlife. I suspect it's stock footage. Like I said the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason I didn't switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and I didn't want to wake the sweet thing. But the last half hour of the movie did get better. We finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them. The most entertaining (and at the same time funny) scene is when Alice and Daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses. We're looking at a matchbox-version of the van falling in the river here. Funny. But nicely shot. In fact there are several other nice traveling camera-moves. Surprisingly for this type of flick. I was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie but I don't wanna spoil it completely in case you do decide to watch this movie. My advice is to stay away from it. If you wanna see a decent alligator movie then see Lewis Teague's ALLIGATOR. I admit that one isn't Italian and isn't a JAWS rip-off but it certainly is more fun. And if you're interested in other movies made by director Sergio Martino then I strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK. That one's an over-the-top rip-off of every possible existing post-apocalyptic-future-of-doom-movie. Italians and rip-offs two words that go together very well. ",negative
" Except people apparently buy into this garbage! As shows like Moral Orel have shown even if you tried to make the most outrageous over-the-top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of it wouldn't come close to the hilarity of this show. It's hard to tell what's even going on when you're watching it. Is it a news show? A talk show? Who knows!? They start out by reporting on various international news stories but at seemingly random points the news is interrupted by this odd troll-like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy. Pat Robertson doesn't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance. He just seems like a senile yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who has called for an assassination who has befriended and offered aid to not one but TWO murderous dictators who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines who has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China and who regularly implies that Caucasians (straight American male Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races. Still this would all be funny except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later (either that or enough money to bribe some TV executives who don't give a damn what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people somewhere must be watching it and hanging onto every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is people still listen to him. I don't know if it's funny or scary. I guess a healthy mixture of both. ",negative
" I had high hopes for this film. I thought the premise interesting. I stuck through it even though I found the acting save Helena Bonham Carter unremarkable. I kept hoping my time spent would pay off but in the end I was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing. Maybe in George Orwell's version there is a message worth conveying. If this film accomplished anything it has inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption. If the film maker's message is the mundane life is worth living well then they've succeeded. I would recommend this film to no one; 101 minutes of my life wasted. ",negative
" It is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of Marxism from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge one still finds admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor. It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood. In this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified. Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship.

" Just saw this movie on TV and I have to admit I was a bit surprised it was even on. There were so many goofs mess-ups and bad editing that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to watch. The acting was OK but please you can really feel the Straight to Video feeling. The cast/crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes there is a message in the movie but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it. Trust me you wouldn't even tell the difference.

" I don't know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director. It seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars (Angie Charlie Denise Rosanna and Jon) that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie. This could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene. Since it got an R rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES in the world? If they were only looking for laughs why not cast Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old. What a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well. ",negative

" Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this screenwriter should of read it. I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is all about. This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book. The whole 'red room' is so down played that I wonder why they even bother to put it in. In the book the 'red room' is foreshadowing for the WHOLE story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated so badly in the movie I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head. The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told it. ",negative
" Since its release in 1983 A Christmas Story the Jean Shepherd-narrated story of his alter-ego Ralphie has become a true classic. My Summer Story however still has Shepherd as the narrator but it has absolutely none of the charm and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film. My Summer Story is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops. Charles Grodin who I normally like is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father (more aptly handled by Darren McGavin in the original) and his character never seems anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralphie and the little brother is all but forgotten here. Only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on free dish night . The stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper-thin. May appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to A Christmas Story it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time. 2 out of 10. ",negative
" Bamboo House of Dolls (1973 1974 or 1977 various years are given for this title) is a Hong Kong veteran Chin Hung Kuei's (Killer Snakes Boxer's Omen Payment in Blood etc.) women in prison flick produced by the legendary Shaw Brothers. Yes even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this and Bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre even when compared to the Western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the Eastern films! The story is about a Japanese war camp in which the Chinese women are brutalized abused and raped by the bad Japanese (what else?) during the World War II. The girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a Chinese military officer raised in Japan (Shaw veteran Lo Lieh) is actually now an undercover agent among the other Japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell. What follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity female kung fu some nasty torture gore sleaze and extremely offensive anti Japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn't even try to be more than it is. There are hardly any interesting elements in Bamboo House of Dolls. The occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that's about it in the merits department. The fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other. The violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds misogynistic torture scenes (for example one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc.) and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it. Of course it is stupid to talk about moral when writing about this kind of film but still there are elements I won't accept to be found from any film. The film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure! For example the gold box filled with heavy gold seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don't seem to have any problems lifting and moving it not to speak of throwing it! Also those numerous skin fight scenes make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema. I have seen the same director's Killer Snakes (1973) which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society. Also it is a must for those who fear snakes. Bamboo House of Dolls has suffered some censorship too which isn't a surprise considered the subject matter. The uncut version (dubbed into a non-English language) released in Europe at least in France Italy and Switzerland runs 104 PAL minutes while the cut English dubbed print released in Holland Belgium and Greece runs only 84 minutes in PAL. From what I've heard the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and plot development and the like. Bamboo House of Dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something I wouldn't have liked to see from the Shaw Brothers or Hong Kong in general. Some of the Italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation. 2/10 ",negative
" What kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself?! Unlike Ray or countless other films about music artists half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is reliving the great songs themselves. Here all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters and these renditions fail to capture Cohen's slow jazzy style. More often the covers are badly sung folk versions. Yuck. The interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with Cohen himself. Only rarely does the film feature Cohen reading his own work (never singing)-- like letters poems etc. The movie really didn't capture much about the artist's life story either or about his development through the years. A huge disappointment for a big Cohen fan. ",negative
" This has to be the most brutally unfunny comedy I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller Jack Black and Christopher Walken as a crazed homeless man CAN'T make me laugh? Something's got to be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever felt like walking out of. I used free passes and still felt like I wanted my money back. I can wholeheartedly say that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this one was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. worse. movie. I laughed very slightly at the merry-go-round scene and that's it. Spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh right? I don't know I guess the filmmakers thought that flan was a funny word or something. And the other running joke really is beating a dead horse--literally. ",negative
" I'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the American Revolutionary War. This ain't it. (And for that matter neither was the Emmerich/Devlin/Gibson THE PATRIOT. But I digress.) I saw this film at a publicity screening at the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before it came out. The audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece written by veteran Robert Dillon directed by the esteemed Hugh Hudson (of CHARIOTS OF FIRE fame) and starring Al Pacino. But it didn't take long for people to start squirming in their seats whispering derisive comments about Pacino's horribly misconceived accent -- he was supposed to be an American frontiersman of Scottish ancestry(!) -- and that of Nastassja Kinski who was supposed to be recently emigrated from England(!!). Then the story started and it all went downhill fast. Motivations were muddled dialogue was atrocious events had no historical or political context. What there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence; by the second or third time that alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a British officer/pederast. His accent was all over the map too. I guess there weren't any English actors available. Lots of people left. Those who stayed tried to stifle giggles then openly guffawed. I stuck it out -- I figured that at least the battle scenes might be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably Hudson chose to film them with hand-held cameras not even Steadicam the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel 'authenticity' which ruined the sense of scale. There was a semi-famous TV reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me: (the late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us. And sure enough on his TV segment the next day he gave the film a '10' on his notorious 'Franklin Scale of 1 to 10' while remarking churlishly about the louts who'd disrupted the screening the night before who clearly didn't know art when they saw it. What a buffoon. After this disaster Pacino didn't star in another film for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered. You can't say I didn't warn you. ",negative
" I've been using IMDb for a few years now but have never written any reviews before. However this movie so disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I couldn't keep quiet anymore. Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins)who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a as a vigilante The Rectifier and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car-alarm sounding. I take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer. Although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms. Car alarms car alarms car alarms. There is really no other focus. When the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of Robbins' character. Yes we're all annoyed by noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle and this movie uses that fact and pretty much that fact alone to sell this movie. I say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship (including a completely needless threesome) which is obviously thrown in for those movie-goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie. Honestly it's eye-rolling. Robbin's character very shortly into the movie becomes completely unrelatable. It seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry car-bashing dude into this hero of the little guy The Rectifier. However... the transformation doesn't take place. He just renames himself. I could go on for a while. Annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie and the self-satisfied smirk which never quite leaves Robbins face doesn't help either. Overall I think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be as it's pretty much shoved down your throat but in my opinion it fails in a big way. Just one guy's opinion cheers. ",negative
" Great western I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Well I'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one I saw. Great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none! The acting was poor to say the least and I couldn't care less about any of the characters making the whole film pointless. the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to TV low budget rubbish like you see on those FACT OR FICTION programmes on sci-fi. Please if you are looking for a good film a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half please look elsewhere. ",negative
" In fact these young people were so distasteful that I couldn't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton) since I considered her the most annoying of the bunch. But I knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen Christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing in the background. It had nowhere to go but down. Even the prosthetics looked fake and the blood looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch although later on it took on red day-glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing. I'm sure all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t since it'll appeal to that bunch. It sure didn't appeal to me. Blah... And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself. She still looks hot though. I'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays. However it is a step up from Dante Tomaselli's meandering HORROR (2002) in that it has a somewhat coherent plot so I'll give it that much. That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also brings it up a notch. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film. Lion's Gate Films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up. 2 out of 10 ",negative

" *Warning - no plot spoilers ahead but movie spoilers nonetheless...* My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast. Wow - very very wrong. This movie is an overdone overwrought and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot! The copyright date on the box said 2005 yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos. It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback and therefore supposed to look old but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s... then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences (yet it's a different much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks). I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up (and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes). Thus this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time. The shell story shot in 2005 is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead (something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005?) These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie. Don't bother. There's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it's terrible. ",negative
" It could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of America's most notorious serial killers but sadly it doesn't even come close. Terrible editing direction bad acting you name it.

" Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. To pick on the technical flaws - silver F/A-18s and F-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu. ",negative
" The only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes. Other than that this movie is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min. of the movie which added nothing. Then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve. They begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her. From there this movie gets worse way worse. I know its only a movie and you've gotta go with the flow but she's got about a 5 min. headstart and she can't hide or find someone to help her. Instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest. In typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her. But now she turns into one tough mofu. You get the point. Do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type. It's so illogical you'll be questioning every scene. It is embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast as well as the consumers. ",negative
" The John Goodman program was pretty awful but this thing just plain stinks. The one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of Patrick Starfish as Frosty. The story is hopeless written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everybody is unpleasant and for no reason. The plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it. The worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow! ",negative

" I didn't feel as if I'd been raped like I did with THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS but BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS BMW hates its audience although not to such an extreme degree. It's ugly uncanonical idiotic and the writing is horrifically bad.None of the stories work. These are not the characters we loved from BATB at all they're a bunch of pod people. I wanted to dissect it but after a few minutes I gave up because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously. What we have here are three stories. The Perfect Word is an overbearing ponderous study of forgiveness. Fifi's Folly only works if you can accept that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she's a closet James Bond villainess and that Lumiere is an idiot concerning women. Broken Wing (or Broken Wind as I like to call it) is probably the most heinous of the bunch. Beast hates birds? Since WHEN? Don't watch this crap- every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic a transcendent celebration of love art intelligence and the human soul. ",negative
" By the numbers story of the Kid (Prince) a singer on his way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife-beating father (Clarence Williams III!) and his own self-destructive behavior. I saw this in a theatre in 1984. I was no big fan of Prince but I did like the three big songs from this movie-- Purple Rain Let's Get Crazy and When Doves Cry . The concert scenes in this movie are great--full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately that's a VERY small portion of the movie. The story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times before--and much better too. The subplots are to put in nicely badly handled. The love triangle between The Kid Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually became insulted. His wife beating father is needed for the story but the scenes are so badly handled (in acting and direction) that I couldn't believe it. The script is terrible--lousy dialogue and some truly painful comedy routines. And there's tons of misogyny here--The Kid's mother getting beaten; The Kid hitting Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Also Williams' and Princes' characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly. The acting is where this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful--but no actor. And Prince is (easily) the WORST actor I've ever seen. His blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad I couldn't believe it. This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there aren't really that many. The dramatic scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through. They should have just made this a concert film. I give this a 2--only for the music. ",negative
" A model named Laura is working in South America when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle. They demand a huge ransom for her release. Peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl. Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend Jack. They try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for Laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter. The helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that (not going well so far). Also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts. In reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem. He starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and Laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives. The rest of the film is a bit of a blur really. Now I'm not a massive Jess Franco fan in fact to date this is only the second film of his I have seen but even I can tell that this really isn't one of his best efforts. The films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening. The whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute TV show. There are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out. Devil Hunter is poorly lit (Infact I don't think it was lit at all) badly dubbed poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn't bore me. I think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it. For example a scene where Laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting. Another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes. Then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him. It has to be seen to be believed. Then of course there is the actual devil. It is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes he has very blurry vision. The film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80's here in the UK and was banned. Now why it was I have no idea. There is very little gore at all and it's hardly a shocking film. Minus the nudity I would have said that it could get away with a PG almost. The only thing I can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth. There is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive Jess Franco fan. There is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise I would say just pay for a ticket to South America and get lost in a jungle. It would probably be more fun. 3/10 ",negative

" What a piece of stupid tripe. I won't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show. It's not worth the time. The one comment I will make is - why get such a DUMB inarticulate doofus to be the star?!? There aren't many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that FOX has stated it will NOT bring back John Doe (a decent series) but WILL bring back brain-dead drivel like Joe Millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public.

" To be honest I didn't like Executive Decision - which was obvious the template - very much but compared to this piece of crap it looks like a masterpiece of art. Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar. It is so ridiculous that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas then don't use it then use it anyway) which dropped my rating finally to the bottom. You can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk. ",negative
" I question its importance to Queer Cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence. Three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner. I found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didn't sit well with me. Weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times. There was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film. More like a 45 minute Boy's Brief short rather than a fleshed out full-length film. It had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts. The 1st part: Boxer/Stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin. Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he confronting him? I felt as though their cat-mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion. We needed more information about them and less Parking Lot/Locker scenes with Tim relentlessly saying What do you want? The 2nd part: Danny wants his buddy Tony to beat him up while he jacks-off. Tony doesn't seem to mind but he doesn't even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby -- not even after they do it in the nude. This tale lacks the all-important transition from I'm a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to I think I might be gay and hitting him because I'd like to spread his ass and do him S/M style. A very important thing to leave out. Clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time. The 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought. Furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film. Yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy. The make-up (bruises and cuts) however was on par with a grammar school talent show. There wasn't enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic. The film made no statement squandered time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment. Its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously. ",negative
" Though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that's less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma of Ray Milland. That said several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. Also John Barrymore is present popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises. Anyway it's another endless night for BD as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. The clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining. ",negative

I ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror but I got bored and turned it off.Let's see: The wardrobe: Consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot. The masks were made from what looks like tin foil. The Gore: The Gore was pretty good I must give it that. But Ittenbach's Burning moon was better for a low budget movie. Acting: Was horrible! I didn't mind the dubbing. I find this humorous like in Ittenbach's Premutos (great movie). The fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor. Bottom line: Don't watch any of Schnaas's movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter. Check Premutos House of blood Schramm and the nekromantiks. ",negative

Poor costumes bad interviews and basically there is not one wrestler on this whole disc with any shred of charisma. The wrestling in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline. They make sure to giggle together all the while too making the experience seem more like a toddler's playtime than a wrestling deathmatch .

" This movie is written by Charlie Higson who has before this done the legendary Fast Show and his own show based on one of Fast Show's characters (Tony the car sales man). He's also written James Bond books for kids. Actually I've seen before this only Gordon's movies that are based on Lovecraft's stories and every one of those is marvelous. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is totally contemporary which means shaky camera fast and strange cutting cool chillout music in the background. It works quite well here I guess but it's still pointless and cheap. It makes me often think of the cameraman who's shaking his dv-camera in front of the actors/actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures (hoping that something tolerable would come out of it). The casting is good and there is a whole atmosphere which is the result of good directing. I think the main character the zero young guy is quite interesting in his zeroness . The fat guy is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin but is not him. But pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not-so-interesting: In this case I mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness. There is not much humanity in this film/story: It's totally pessimistic and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead. Needless to say that there is no humor either. It's a 1'40 long vomit without no relief in any moment. Anyway Gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today and I think of this movie as an experiment and as a failure in that. Everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes just to learn and to find their way again. This might be Gordon's most uninteresting and empty work. ",negative
" This can't be Mandy Schaffer's last film. Somebody do something! :-( Argh. What little life this one might have had the directing finished off. Don't blame the cast; they did OK. Even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through. And please please put Mandy in some more movies! She's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age. Ya' breakin' my haht heah.... Two specific criticisms in case anyone cares (apparently nobody liked this movie very much). First the way Traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment in order to see whatever she was supposed to see and never got seen in return was very annoying. Hollywood: please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives. It's dumb. Write better scripts so you won't have to use that lame plot device any more. If your script isn't good enough to stand up without that then don't produce it. Second Carmen wouldn't have fallen for that fake injury trick that Traci pulled. She already had Traci fingered. More bad writing/directing there. I could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it. Actually I didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have. It just didn't have much of a reason for being made unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely Mandy. Oh and to whoever didn't think she was sexy... the character wasn't very well written but how can you say she wasn't sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses and I don't think it's me. MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with Moore Mandy -- although I'd like to see her again too. ;-) P.S. Did I mention I hope Mandy makes me more movies? <:-D ",negative
" I'm allowed to write 1000 words about this film but one word could suffice: bizarre. Hubby and I didn't laugh so much as gawk at this truly dreadful movie. We kept looking at each other with our best What the...? expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this movie. Killer tomatoes were funny but this is just sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird weird movie and then packages it as if it is appropriate for children? Parents whatever you do if your child still believes in Santa don't let him/her see this movie. Preteens can watch it -- probably with What the...? expressions on their faces. If you decide to inflict this movie on others you might want to spike their eggnog. Quite possibly the worst film ever made. ",negative
" If derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing then you're in for a rare treat... They don't really appeal to me so I couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something straight out of the 1980s a different age when this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? It's a big blot on both of your reputations. Listen carefully: can you hear the thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair? ",negative
" It is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girl... This film has a nice concept-the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. It has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate... a nice start you might say but then it got a bit greedy very greedy it tries to be a science fiction a drama a thriller a possible romantic love story fairy tale a comedy and everything under the sun. The result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate. For example the scene when the girl(played by Risa Goto) finally woken by his(Yuki Kohara) kiss instead of being romantic it try's to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards... it is a cheap trick because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the film. I have not read the original story the film is base on (it is the well-known work by the comic-book artist Osamu Tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories) I wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption? It is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the fussy logic of those japanese comic-book. For instance how did Yuki Kohara's character manage to get to the hospital in an instant(when its suppose to be a long bus-ride away)to run away Risa Goto's character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the television? There are also some scenes that is directly copied(very uncreative!) from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie. the famous the Lion mouth has caugh my hand scene from the Roman Holiday The film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing... it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy... and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ghost movie. Nevertheless one should give it credit that it has managed to caputured some of the sentiment of the japanese teenager. It is by watching this film I have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said this film might only be suitable for person under the 18 of age it would have definitly been on the poster of this film.

" Ugh! Where to begin ... first Campbell Scott's non-stop angst becomes a real turn-off after awhile (a very short while) as he internalizes his mounting anguish curiosity and anger. Only we don't care! These characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable and therein lies the key. They haven't given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another. When Scott quietly tells his wife I could kill you before their three daughters at the dinner table after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off I almost wished that he had--and then done the same thing to the smug wisecracking apparition of Denis Leary before being hauled off the the looney bin. An utter waste of time and perhaps--only perhaps--resources. ",negative
" I remember when this piece of trash came out all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken Barbra Streisand years to get the film made. Well it couldn't have taken that many years; the play only opened in 1975 eight years previously. It made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh who probably should have been cast in the film but NOOOOO...the Great STAR BARBRA HAD TO DO IT HER WAY. AND WITH MUSIC NO LESS! This film is a total disaster from start to finish. For one thing Barbra was FORTY YEARS OLD when she made it and she looked every minute of it. There was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study Torah. And then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy. I get the impression that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make-up; she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl. And as if that is not bad enough she gets involved with both her schoolmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end) AND his fiancée (Amy Irving who does her usual sleepwalker routine a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing). Yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl; I won't even bother to mention the wedding night scene. Then there is the music. Nine totally forgettable songs all sung by Streisand via voice-over (presumably as a look inside her mind) and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard. I won't say that Streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here; some of the visuals are lovely (Patinkin's backside especially) and she has a good eye for balance. The problem with this movie is that she won't get out of her own way. I did not believe her for one second in the title role; she should NEVER have added the songs and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes. I was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty-five minutes. Awful awful awful. ",negative
" For the life of me I cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the Jerry Springer Show . It's so incrediably trashy. Some ways sadly it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty bad. I will admit that. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So I would recommend skipping Ringmaster . Just watch the Jerry Springer Show . It's more enjoyable than this. 2/10 ",negative
" Bela Lugosi revels in his role as European horticulturalist (sic) Dr. Lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia. The good doctor's aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty. What better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows? Sedating them into a coma-like state he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie. ** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi Luana Walters Elizabeth Russell ",negative
" Shecky is a god damned legend make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain running their testing department. We would go through many new starters they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift got round to sending their DVD player back they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with. Now as to why this film is so bad where do I begin? Adam Sandler who can be so so very funny as in Happy Gilmore or the Wedding Singer must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew stank and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero. I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come and just how low he can go. ",negative
" I sat through this movie this evening forcing myself to stick with it even though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan were major film stars of their era and I wanted to see them in something different which this certainly was. They both gave fine performances but of distasteful characters. Indeed the whole movie is about a shabby little town in Mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters (the doctor is of course the major exception). What Michèle Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. This is supposedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that if Sartre's work is anything like this movie it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating Camus' masterful novel The Plague which dealt with a plague in North Africa. A well-acted but uninteresting movie. ",negative
" It is difficult to find any positives in this movie. Seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort & hence we are treated to a full showing of Galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history. The police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More action shots of the two cops & a lot less of Galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun. Ms Albright does excellent looking sexy & her acting is first rate. Ms Stabs whom I had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent. Apart from Ms Albright this is real garbage. ",negative
" This movie was a real torture fest to sit through. Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it. When it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that's missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children! . While watching this movie I kept thinking where'd you hear that? or that can't possibly be true - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources. And bless 'em the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power; to be fair that might be the fault of the film-makers but equally fairly it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars. As for the performers........... Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I've enjoyed and I'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause. But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by. Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be trying too hard - he looks like he can't possibly believe the things he's being told (not that I blame him) but desperate to feel noticed and included. James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever Stand and Fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine. In fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing. Nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn't mean much to them at all. It's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall of the band Orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the 70s. (Remember if you dare Dance With Me and Still the One .) It's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music. The cause is supposedly life-or-death but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they're playing the Catskills. Except maybe Gil-Scott Heron - his protest number We Almost Lost Detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' he's being. Only Bruce Springsteen's performance raises a pulse; I've never been a big fan of the Boss but he absolutely smokes no question. Part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience. Compared to the general blandness and air of self-satisfaction here it's no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll. But even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting. I don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a '70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split-second cutaways to a back-up singer's tonsils. Now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with; and *maybe* the film-makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch Rust Never Sleeps or The Last Waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill. And with more exciting musicians. So really there's only two things to watch this movie for: Springsteen's stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counter-culture in decline. ",negative
" For months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media so I patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about. After it was over I had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. It essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you cannot stand any of them. The film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric moronic and crude. The only slightly amusing character is Eric whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on. The final twist designed to make you laugh at the three main characters only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards Peet. All in all only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor. ",negative
" This movie wasn't just bad - it was terrible. After I watched it I actually felt the need to TAKE A SHOWER to get the filth off of me. There is running 'gag' with an elderly couple making out it is not funny but it is disgusting. The monster make up was cool but that is all. The continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least I was. The editing is really poor. Almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends are into 'bad movies' this one is exceptional in its ineptitude I couldn't even bring myself to laugh at it. You have been warned. ",negative
" Well what can i say about this movie. I'm speechless. I could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing that REALLY pi*sed me off was the music. And to top it all off someone commented on how much they LIKED it. To them all I have to say is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time Fistsof fury starring Bruce Lee. IF he was still alive and ever came across this movie he'd be horrified. the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say tape because a movie like that couldn't possibly have been shot on film.I now feel more stupid for wasting 30 minutes of my life watching it. The only reason why i even saw it was because my roommate downloaded it out of morbid curiosity. What is this world coming to. ",negative
" From the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated 'Hillybilly Horror' sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks. Sound familiar? Well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre. There is absolutely new here. The film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichés (deformed hicks a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show the rebellious daughter the one 'freak' who's good at heart etcetera...) but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time. This is forgettable dreck but humorously enough lead J.D. Hart once starred in a movie called Films that Suck earlier in his career quite an ironic omen indeed. My Grade: D- ",negative
" This sure is one comedy I'm not likely to forget for a while. Wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie: it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is. So what is it then? Well of course it's not really a comedy; instead it's intended as a horror flick -- intended very much being the key word here. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic and as for the acting well let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent. Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned. Also even though I'm a big fan of the horror genre I'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting. But still. B-movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humour in that--and I could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually dozing off after that--then that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh that and two or three pairs of breasts. Woohoo how exciting. As for the story it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything: the victims either use drugs and/or are involved in serious crime. The lesson: Watch out naughty boys and girls because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done. I rest my case. So all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock 'n roll. I rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if I could. Or perhaps I wouldn't: it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles. I mean that's something innit? ",negative
" Every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films I seek out to watch isn't always impeccable. I normally would stay away from stuff like this but I was duped by some glowing reviews and the Rohmer pedigree. There's an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where Rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted (digital) back-drops of revolution era France. This quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene. What we're left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century France. None of the characters are appealing or sympathetic. The pace is so languid the dialogue so arduous and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to Rohmer that I ended up not caring whose head rolled who was harboring who or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about. The movie would've greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build-up and a music score (there's some fine classical music used at the very end). Despite being so talky the film plays much like a silent film and the worst kind of film at that a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects. Only the most astute French historians will find anything to take from this film as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle (the Lady is English and a royalist). Otherwise avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia (I dozed off twice). ",negative
" Very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of Stanley Tucci who tries but can not save the poor structure dialogue direction or talent of our leading man.

" I've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film. I can't say that I found much to recommend it. The Leonard Cohen sound track is not only excessively heavy-handed but dreary beyond measure. The film looks authentic enough but something's got to happen for it to work and nothing much does: a cursory plot (not a real problem for me) not much character development nothing thematically. It just slogs along. Flawed as it is Cimino's Heaven's Gate has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film I'd sooner watch again. For a brilliant reconception of the West HBO's Deadwood is much superior to McCabe.  ",negative
" This movie is simply far too long far too repetitive with the male nudity and sexuality being (as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles) far too gratuitous and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience (and stamina) of an audience. I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon with a film festival audience; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome interested in more experimental or atypical films such as one without much dialog shorts foreign films. The near sell out crowd in an approximate 275 seat theater started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the pay off (which never actually arrived) I have never in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals experimental gay and otherwise seen such a large number of people walk away from a film. This movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was. It also could have gone in different directions still with a shorter running time and been far more effective. As it currently exists this is not something that one can readily recommend or one I would have any desire to watch again. ",negative
" Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages. In all I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi Jr. I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me. ",negative

" This movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost. We love musicals but not this one. Even with the terrible sound quality poor cinematography and many actors who can't sing or dance Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie a drunk lady was enjoyable to watch too. The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music. Admittadly some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way). Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! We think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors). ",negative
" Wimpy stuffed shirt Armand Louque (blandly played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls for the lovely Claire Duval (fetching blonde Dorothy Stone) who uses the meek sap to get Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson (the hopelessly wooden Robert Noland) to marry her. Furious over being used and spurned by Claire Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. Sound exciting? Well it sure ain't. For starters Victor Halperin's static (non)direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace. Worse yet Halperin crucially fails to bring any tension atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings. The mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn't help matters any; only George Cleveland as the hearty General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr. Trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics. The drippy stock film library score the painfully obvious stagebound sets and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well. In fact this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom. A dismally dull dud.

" Okay you have: Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) She's killed off in the first scene - that's right folks; this show has no backbone! Peter O'Toole as Ol' Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor. Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (Brit spelling not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. It's alright they have Col. Cricket's full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes 'round for Christmas!) Still she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!) David McCallum as said toy-boy equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. Pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus. and finally: Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls' Boarding-School serving tea in her office with a dash of deep poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: I've only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful but somehow not part of the real world. Well we can't say they didn't warn us. Ah Susan - time was your character would have been running the whole show. They don't write 'em like that any more. Our loss not yours. So - with a cast and setting like this you have the re-makings of Brideshead Revisited right? Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!) First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - hey it's just the sunlight! Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying her eyes are moist. That's the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is dewy-eyed. Henceforth Leading Lady shall be known as L.L. Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love. Still I'll give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?) And lastly fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is Mrs. She's either Miss or Lady. When all was said and done I still couldn't tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldn't even tell you what was said and done. To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all. OK at the end L.L. finds she's lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (there's always a meanwhile ) some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when I don't know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHE's going to find him there.) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be whisked away SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!) Great drama. ",negative
" One wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen like it's the case with this movie. The Wedding Date is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake under the guise of a new story something that should have been let alone. If a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval then go all out with big stars and glossy production values that way people will come for the stars. Alas that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to London when basically this seems to be a typical American situation that not even the setting will be able to fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! Since the Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be. It's clear that Kat will fall for Nick and vice-versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams who was the best asset in Junebug comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her. For anyone interested the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes! ",negative
" This film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness. While a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony it certainly can't promote winning bridge so the satire didn't work for me. But there were some items I found enjoyable anyway especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It is treated like very much like a championship boxing match. Not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring there is a referee hovering between the contestants and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings. At one point he even enumerates One... Two... Three... Four... as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event. And people were glued to their radios for it all a common event for championship boxing matches. That spoof worked very well indeed. Unfortunately few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. Paul Lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh weren't given good enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film but she practically disappears thereafter. What a waste of talent! ",negative
" Here's a review for people like me. This movie sucks from beginning to end. I threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la MSF2000. The plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned????? And she's rich???? And she's a famous psychologist????? COME ON people. She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. Rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters war-starters and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME. Mamet can't create characters; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They're confused about everyone being the same character. (However his later films do improve.) ",negative
" I've been a fan of all things Bill Maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting. Of course I am Catholic come from a well-educated family and go to church of my own volition which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of Bill's opinions. Bill's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative. He's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i.e. one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion (or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of God) but that said he never looks at its positive side. Quite frankly I think that hell would freeze over before Bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of Calcutta where Mother Theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor. She's dead now of course but he could easily visit the Jesuit priest in East LA who runs Homeboy Industries which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their tattoos removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit USC's Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians diplomats and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than $1 a day. Of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion and it's so much easier to continue to make snide superficial jokes. That fits into the other large problem with Bill's movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is. In this movie you have Maher the Cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational Christian truck stop service in a night club with a Dutch guy who smokes pot all the time with the minister of a storefront church in Miami who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ and with an actor playing Jesus at a Holy Land theme park. What you won't see in Bill's film beyond some superficial speculation alongside a Ph.D in Grand Central Station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like Notre Dame BYU or Wheaton College who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter. You won't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of C.S. Lewis G.K. Chesterton or any papal encyclicals and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non-Abrahamic (Judaism Christianity and Islam) faiths whatsoever. All you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending snobby elitist from the west side of LA who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut-level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of America that elected George W. Bush (twice) lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it. I get a lot of what Bill's saying but for someone possessing his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic. Anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the Teletubbies. ",negative
" This is easily the worst movie i have EVER seen. I'm not exaggerating I told the guy at Blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves. The only thing interesting about this movie is the box. On the box it says from the director of the boogeyman so I figured...eh whatever if this was made recently I'm sure the directing at least won't be TOO bad :-\ but after I saw the movie and looked at what boogeyman they were talking about it's some nonsense from the early 1980's that he made. Great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers. ANYWAY I think that they just liked the name Zodiac Killer and didn't bother to research any of the actual Zodiac's crimes or his MO or even the years that he was active. All of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the stories about the original Zodiac take place several years after the actual Zodiac's crimes did. They also compare the Zodiac to Vampire of Dusseldorf Fritz Haarman throughout the movie and talk to Fritz's son quite often. The Zodiac and Haarman were nothing alike and it makes more sense to compare him to BTK who also shot people not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks. None of the Haarman facts are correct either just a bunch of jumbled nonsense. His son even says Don't forget his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t's ...His actual name just has one! I think that the writer/director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. Ooh those sound like cool names let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research! great idea! Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from DSM-IV and getting cured of it. I was also diagnosed with DSM-IV and have since recovered etc. For those of you who don't know DSM-IV is the psychological manual for mental disorders. If anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some SERIOUS problems! Haha. Anyway my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list and it's rare that a movie ever reaches that point. But if you are interested in watching a totally non-fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring full of inexperienced actors and not completely rational I'd say check out this movie. ...Oh and I liked how the killer tear gassed a few of his victims with dry ice. Nice touch... ",negative
" This is possibly the worst of all the Columbo movies. Andrew Stevens' acting is poor as the villain and the plot is weak. In fact none of the cast seem able to act other than Peter Falk who puts in a creditable performance as the Lieutenant. ",negative
" I'm giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in IMDb rating system. this movie was horrible. It was very badly acted the story was poorly written the action was unbelievable. I doubt even the Salvation Army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film. I won't even write any plot spoilers because the movie just isn't good enough for plot spoilers. To write comments on the plot would be pointless. If I were to compare this movie I'd have to compare it to Reign of Fire however although I didn't like Reign of Fire either that movie at least was better than this one. Some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done. The only reason I didn't was because I simply didn't think to do it. I was hoping for a feast of CGI and fighting masterfully done but that isn't what happened. The martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash-back scene very disappointing. The CGI was not done well either. One scene comes to mind. During one of the earlier tank battles the troops are firing away at......nothing. Someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys. I'm also thinking the bad guy's voice was dubbed by the voice-over of Imotep from The Mummy movies. Had that same scraggly echoing thing going on. (Someone owed some royalties here?) Since I mentioned the fight scene I'll say yeah that might be considered a spoiler but only to the purists I suppose. Don't go see it don't buy the DVD when it comes out either. You have been warned.

" Gods I haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while. Maybe not since 'The New Guy' or various Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes it is that astoundingly awful. Mira Sorvino's blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by Freddie. The movie staging was awkward (like a play rather and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well on film). The actors had no idea what they were doing especially Sorvino. Her accent was awful and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and they 'falling' for it. And what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? Nonsensical! I had to turn the dvd player off it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film. ",negative
" Believe it or don't i have my very own DVD copy of this movie which i bought at Walgreens for a great big whole dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted. Pretty amazing set designs and costumes. Apparently much thought and effort went into their making. The set designs are very Mexican in stylization. I liked them a lot. And Santa is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom. I'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience. But somehow it comes across quite deranged. In fact i'm left stunned at how deranged it is. Maybe it's the English dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre. One of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness. The kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very very weird. Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns? You didn't? Neither did i until i watched this movie. One learns something new everyday. Is this movie actually worth watching? Now that's a tossup. I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way. Yet its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching. You decide what you're going to do. I dunno... for myself it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves. Now that's just wrong... ",negative
" When i saw the preview for this on TV i was thinking ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie but it was not. it was not scary at all! acting was good plot was horrible the military bid was just plain stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could of done better than this piece of crap. The movie made it sound like Arron was going to turn into a werewolf instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor's throat out. If you have read some of my other reviews on other movies there all positive but this one is not simply because the story was terrible. One out of 10 max. Im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick but i bet you didn't expect this. Beyond Loch Nes was way better than this movie heck any movie thats on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie. ",negative
" I rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an Academy Award but after watching it it's easy to see why it didn't. Despite the beautiful photography the film is incredibly slow moving despite having hardly any plot. The plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents' death in what may or may not have been an accident (the film is never clear on this) and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories. The fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot but they're very short and don't really seem to have any point. The first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient but that doesn't make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure. Perfect metaphor for this film really. The photography of Skye is beautiful though but then Stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this one.

" This was so far the worst movie I have seen in my entire life and I have seen some REALLY bad movies. I saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The filming of the movie was scattered and boring. At one point there is a one-minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring with annoying unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of. If you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise when you see this movie run. ",negative
" The only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song. Stephanie Powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent. As has been pointed out she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter? Lee Remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Don't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs. It strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them. Can anybody believe that handsome Robert Urich would remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? The WW2 engagement between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is laughable. To begin with the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until late in the war it was controlled by the Vichy French puppet government. We see the French resistance staging a daylight raid on Mistral's villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of Nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them? If you want to see a well acted mini-series set in a foreign country don't watch Mistral's Daughter. A far better alternative would be The Thorn Birds. ",negative
" Beginning with the poster (featuring only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey) the entire movie was a fraud. One stereotype after another this movie was about nothing - or nothing new at least. After 10-15 minutes you realize that you've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another cop-flick. Basically the story is about the corrupt system in some city all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politician. The almighty and above-the-law organization is called FRAT and guess what? they've got a kick-ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects girlfriends you name it. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. One hour later after a series of unbelievably bad-made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines everything ends happily and we get served the final line : you can't beat the system. Bah! Don't see this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 min altogether! ",negative
" The Cobweb is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong sometimes noteworthy performances and high points but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience. It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all. The plot is preposterous. Its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows. One old woman wants to have her drapes put over them but a lot of the patients want to make their own. And somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children. The questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real-like lunatic could buy it. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the acting. The cast following Widmark is composed of other great actors many of them Academy Award-nominees and winners. And there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes. Unfortunately there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus the movie slows down. A lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest. In a short analysis The Cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus which it does pretty quickly. It just really doesn't sound like much fun to watch and I tell you that it is not much fun to watch. ",negative
" First I'd like to excuse my bad English. I'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore-fan but I liked that movie nevertheless. Live Feed however SUCKED BIG TIME! I have never seen a gore-movie with superb acting but hey who's surprised? The acting in Live Feed was... well not there! I've seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something. Okey but not by students in media or acting school. This was NO class at all! And what about the story? A really sad rip-off on Hostel. And what about the gore? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold-sweating? That was the most disappointing about the hole movie! Short quick and NO edge. More like an execution rather than a torture. Okey there where buckets of blood but it didn't even look real. The slaughtering and the violence reminded more of Braindead than Hostel or any of the Saw-movies. And Braindead was fun! Okey I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun! So instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching Live Feed watch ANYTHING else! ",negative
" Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka the main character is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way he finds changing his mischievous ways hard yet worthy of doing. Personally I found actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre that's the little flavor I meant. All in all I did not really care for this movie although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience. ",negative
" Mad Dog Time ... Trigger Happy whatever you wanna call it...simply doesn't hit the mark. Maybe its just me maybe i just don't like Gangster comedies ( as i thought Oscar Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked ) It's probably more witty sharp wordplay than all out Comedy only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )Make it out to be. The Rick Mick Vic Thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch. There wasn't enough Changes of Location or Feel for the period they were supposed to be in. The Majority of the film was either set in Dreyfus's Club or a variety of Offices /dim rooms... ( what was with that Sit down Gun stand off thing Goldblum kept winning ?) The supporting cast was... on Paper excellent ( great to see Silva & Drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a Joke ! The Romance and Love element of the film also bogged it down. 4/10 I don't think i'll return to it anytime soon. ",negative
" I just saw this movie on Flix after timer-taping it. I grew up watching F Troop and had a major hard for Wrangler Jane so I was shocked literally shocked to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate homicidal nurse was Melody Patterson who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. I would never have guessed it was her in a million years. What the hell is she doing in a picture like this? I agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what it's pushing. No sex no gore no tease. It's also a remake of the Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or thereabouts). Most of the action is tedious; the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctor's house and basement and the neighborhood in general or being roughed up by the cop all of it boring and time-filling. Now if the Italians would have made this half the film would have been the Slingblade/Uncle Ernest/Jack Elam henchman fondling the unconscious nude girls. But you only get that for 20 seconds.

" I basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about. To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD!!! He is so hot but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot. However despite how hot CHACE is it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy camera shaking thing gave me a headache. All in all although the plot was OK I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!! ",negative
" If you're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about then you're in for quite the surprise. Even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline but the actual film is anything but. As the synopsis went it tells of an obsessed mountain climber which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to self  this spells trouble with flashing lights) where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world and notice of all persons this mountain climber and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man. What that translated to is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce. Have shapes created though credit goes to the stop motion style and put it through a mind-numbing loop. And repeat until your eyes start to close then move on to the next scene. If anything the Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the other world. It gets no better as well when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence. Thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what's advertised which is 57 minutes (or less) against the 70 stated. While firmly dated its dull colours non-existent story scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans. Don't waste time. ",negative
" First off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing and I mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling. Most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end!! Some people want a movie that makes them think through the entire thing to which I say... More power to you !! I on the other hand just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this stinker entertainment it is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. Seems that most here agree also. Most of this didn't make any sense and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and....well I guess you see where this is going. Avoid this one sucks....bad!! ",negative

" I read one other review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people being killed taking drugs and talking trash. I don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it but it a way I can see what this person is trying to say: this had no real plot - which is a point i agree with. It is self-indulgent Stone at his best. He really wanted to show not only how war leads to death but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive. Unfortunately the film seems to over glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne grand-standing Oscar-hunting let's create an enduring image for my liking. The problem I have with Stone and other film-makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept: depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is DOES NOT PROVE OR EVEN REFLECT ON WHETHER it was an unjust or immoral war. We have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq. In case you're missing the point let me put it to you bluntly: if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers would you think it was an unjust war? If that fact alone doesn't convince you that it was an unjust war then why should depictions of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance. Personally I do not support America's decision to go to war in Vietnam but i certainly don't subscribe to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory. I don't think that motivations are always wrong by default just because war in itself is terrible. This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid. However this is not Stones first oddball departure. Wall street was a magnificent film up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn. JFK is probably one of the few films Stone did that actually ended very well. But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around. And this is why i gave it such a low mark. It was virtually story-less and ultimately boring - unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy. ",negative
" This Hal Roach comedy short A Tough Winter is the ninety-ninth in the Our Gang/Little Rascals series and the eleventh talkie. Bascally a showcase for black comic Stepin Fetchit who gets special billing here we see him going to his shack where the gang hangs out. Farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for him and is told by Stepin to read it since he can't read it during the day as he goes to NIGHT school. It happens to be from his sweetheart in Tennesse so now Farina has to have his ears stuffed with cotton since it's too hot for him to hear! In another room Weezer relays instructions to Mary Ann of making taffy from the radio but because he keeps running back and forth to the kitchen he misses the lady announcer's segue to rice pudding and Spanish tamale confusing Mary Ann with additions of Tabasco and Lux! After the concoction is completed Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the awful tasting but very sticky substance as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result. As they all try to clean the mess Stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that mixes variable appliances' functions such a telephone that vacuums a vacuum that rings and a refrigerator that plays music! The End. What I've just described portends the meandering nature of this Our Gang short that served as the pilot for a potential Stepin Fetchit movie short series. It's just as well that it never took place as Fetchit's characterization of the lazy Negro was amusing only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today. Many of the scenes I've just described are good for some laughs though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me. So in summary A Tough Winter is a curio worth seeing at least once. By the way Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry. ",negative
" This film was terrible. OK my favourite film is 'The Wicker Man' (1973) so I was always bound to be a little biased. The plot rambles along throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious. (He's not a virgin but IS allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained which I'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make. (How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film?) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout and his character is prone to calling out Rowan!? at the slightest noise. The 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. For example certain incidents mirror the original (The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward/Cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in. I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this I really can't be bothered to write any more about this film. It lacks any kind of substance. Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were 'based' on (in this case very loosely). ",negative
" This is indeed a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared with the American Version with Guinneth Paltrow the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book. But the acting was awful. Besides Kate Beckinsale who I believe was a true likeness of the Emma in the book all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the gentleman he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive had no feeling whatsoever and throughout the entire film you could not see his love growing for Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale who seemed to be trying to resque her leading role as well as her partner's. Moreover there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith played by Samantha Morton seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book. The settings of the film are also too poor. The costumes are even more so. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here. The ending is also too long. It is good that it resembles the book's ending but it is a killer ending for a film. And again I can see no feeling of happiness in the face of Mr.Knightley. To conclude I believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book but with poor actors. It seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all. I would prefer to see the lighter version with Paltrow and Northam even if it is clear that it was made to be a blockbuster than to watch these actors (excepting the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale) ruin the entire script.

" I'm never much for classic films. Movies like Patton Going My Way How Green was My Valley The Godfather Casablanca Annie Hall Gone with the Wind Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane bore me. However I would much rather watch any one of those films 3 469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch An American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I did the latter I'd probably be sleeping the entire time. The color art direction and the music didn't interest me Gershwin or non-Gershwin. The dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep. The dialogue doesn't match up to Singin' in the Rain. Basically this movie is boring. The only other film that I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can't blame me. I only slept 5 minutes the night before. 1 star/10 (Too bad we can't give zeroes.) ",negative
" Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies. Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian Japanese and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review. The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film. 1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would).

" I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors and the director even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss. In this case it was a big miss. Altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like Dead Again I didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and I hope it didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not Tender Mercies but The Great Santini . This movie was truly a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10.

" About halfway through I realized I didn't care about these characters in the least; however I watched a bit more anyway. Regrettably I came back the next day and finished it. I shouldn't have bothered. If you know *anything* about the film beforehand you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what's gonna happen afterward - he's gonna get on the phone and call people about it! That was almost as bad as Snakes on a Plane (another bad aviation catastrophe flick). I realize this is an old film and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today. But even by those standards the acting was embarrassing. These weren't characters they were stereotypes. I suspect this movie was more than anything an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's (Gary Merrill) career. To no avail however - I have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did. Davis' playing the happy cripple (i.e. a non-glamorous role) was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move. It wasn't. It was just boring. She was a kind of Tiny Tim in the film making Trask (Merrill's character) see the truth about love and forgiveness (although she was less winsome than Tiny Tim) calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died. The final scene where Trask calls his wife back in Iowa to reconcile was so affected and over-acted on both ends of the phone line I almost cringed. I had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film. I noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie. If you found it uplifting that's great. But frankly I just found it bad. There are plenty of old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood that were far better written and acted. ",negative
" You wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good and it isn't. It's a no budget ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera...and it's hilarious. The actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. There is no plot to be seen. The little plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families. The gore effects are actually some of the most sickening I've ever seen. It seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs. It's a funny and sickening film and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. My rating: BOMB/****. 90 mins. ",negative
" Who are these They - the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun nobody is getting any actual work done and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet but have an embarrassing look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn drawing on her dignity manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself ostensibly.) Everybody looks great but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys even apart from her singing which while competent is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight but at least they were long on charm. They All Laughed tries to coast on its good intentions but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes. But Laughed is a faint echo of The Last Picture Show Paper Moon or What's Up Doc - following Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged. All in all though the movie is harmless only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time I'll go to the park on a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love I'll stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy... ",negative

" Horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets bad acting and a bit of panache. I think the film is just missing panache because one thuddingly dull scene after another people make laughably harmless claw-handed grabs at the air. If it weren't so boring it might be funny. A horror film can go a long way with a tired concept like college kids in a haunted house in much the same way the Evil Dead movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard plotline. Hallow's End unfortunately doesn't go a long way. Actually it doesn't go anywhere. It spends the better part of an hour setting up faceless and anonymous characters with what seem like endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against character development not even in a horror movie but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha-male the milquetoast the... um... throwaway characters that exist mostly for sex scenes.) Spending forty-plus bloodless droning minutes with them was more horrific than when the bloodshed started. Well implied bloodshed anyway. When the college kids turn into whatever they dressed as for their haunted house (one's a vampire one's wearing O.R. scrubs and some white pancake) they look pretty much the way they did in their amateur haunted house costumes; The Dead Hate The Living using a similar theme is a masterwork in comparison. There isn't really any gore to speak of nor are there any real scares. I've thought about this one from almost every approach. If it was supposed to be a tight suspenseful horror movie (which would explain why things moved so slowly) the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it. If it was supposed to be a genuine blood & guts horror movie (which would explain the schlock)... where's the blood and guts? And the anticlimax is one of the unexciting endings to a movie I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that though it doesn't have a narrator through the film is bookended by voice-overs because all of the meaningless dialogue just wasn't enough. This was a hard one... coming out of it I wonder if I've just sat through a christian horror film. Maybe the I know hell exists of the opening wasn't meant that way but there are some hints (or misdirection-- I'm not sure which). For all the profanity in the film a line like gosh-darnit comes off a little absurd and so does most of the crucifix worshipping god-fearing and satan-dreading especially after some lecherous T&A sex scenes (one heterosexual one lesbian). If it a christian company (Highland Myst's logo even has a bit of a crucifix resemblance) then this film weighs in heavily for the atheist camp. An omnipotent being can't be this bad a filmmaker.

" This movie was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Here are the things that immediately jump out at me: 1. The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a couple trees and brush. Not scary whatsoever. News flash if you are filming in the Southern California area big bear is only an hour away. They actually have trees there. 2. The writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal cliché or just plain stupid. For instance the name of the camp is camp blood (lame) the name of the clown is the killer clown (lame). What is a clown doing in a forest anyway? Was that the only mask they could find? 3. The last but certainly the least was the acting. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting. Worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph. It's a really long scene and I guess she was supposed to be sexy but she was NOT. Also and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me was this tool who is supposed to be athletic. For instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them. Then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run that he is quite far from athletic. Oh and to the girl who played Kat good Lord stop singing. That song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself. If for some reason you do see this movie I would at least recommend watching the special features. The group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story. In fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending. Apparently she hangs out with special kids. ",negative
" This movie is phoniness incarnate a straight 11 / 10 on the phoniness scale. The fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering. Yanks although the real Scotland may be just as colourful if you ever go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to dance out controversies with the locals. Also don't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing. There are a couple of infectious singing-and-dancing scenes but the plot is far too cheesy and linear and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18.th-century Scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay New York City. Maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump. Watch it for the fine alternative-reality view of what a Christopher Streed Day-parade in Scotland would look like on LSD. Other than that I'd only recommend it to Hollywood muscial completists.

" Its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book. This poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails. It fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one (except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films).

" This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made it had everything to make a movie great. Incredible acting awesome special effects...... oh wait I must be thinking of a good movie. Well this wasn't one of them it just plain sucked. What I want to know is what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10. When I casted my vote there were 206 out there god knows what goes on in their head. Now as for any other vote a 8 or 9 was even too high but a 10???

" Almost from the word go this film is poor and lacking conviction but then again most people would struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring as this. The dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less (or should have been). This is also backed-up by odd scenes (e.g. the Cemetry slow-motion walk) that you think might lead somewhere but only seem to waste a few more seconds of your life. The plot is a strange combination of gangster / situation comedy which I am sure seemed a good idea at the time but if ever there was a case for someone needing to be honest with the scriptwriter then here was it. Martin Freeman is okay but then he seems to have one character which always plays so I am beginning to wonder if he was given a script or just filmed and told to react as normal. Finally - humour. This reminds me of the 'Python (I think) quote about Shakespere of his 'comedies' - If he had meant it to be humorous he would have put a joke in it. Well I didn't see one. Don't waste your time - I did because I was watching it with a friend and kept hoping that it was going to get better. It didn't. ",negative

" What this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is (and most US wars recently made only to get some oil).

So let me ask you - if American soldier kills women and children apart from enemy its OK but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well it is not? Your logic fails gentleman. I'll give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 to everything else 3 in total. ",negative
" A call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape) divvies up into split screen for arty purposes practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. Dressed To Kill is exhausting primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. Much of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma's own Carrie --not to mention Psycho . The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock not an homage. Stylish in a steely cold way the end results are distinctly half-baked. ** from **** ",negative
" I wish I could give this movie a zero or even lower because sadly that's what it deserves. I honestly never walk out of a movie but this one was so dreadfully awful that I couldn't stand another minute of it. Please please please- for the sake of mankind- skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into this isn't it. It has unattractive unappealing leads choppy structure ridiculous dialog and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way. On an absolutely basic level it fails to entertain. Everything about Mango Kiss is so stagey it is WORSE than any student film I have seen. As if that weren't enough the entire movie relies on constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over narration. The script writer may as well have written a novel because they insisted on TELLING everything instead of SHOWING it. We are just supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection even though there is no character development to illustrate this. Also this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes and not in a natural way but in a freeze-frame of the characters with their name written over the screen. There is no introduction no development of any of the characters. We don't really get to know any of them. This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen. I am a gay woman who watched this film with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema. I am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like Christian rock - it doesn't matter how atrocious it is people will still flock to it and champion it no matter how poor the quality is. Please don't rent this!! Instead let's encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian movies by renting But I'm a Cheerleader or Fire or Heavenly Creatures instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe they aim at the gay community (i.e. Queer as Folk).

" If there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10 this would be it. 'House of the Dead' redefines the term bad movie . Other bad movies such as 'When A Stranger Calls' or 'Premonition' will actually look much better when compared to 'House of the Dead'. The basic plot of House of the Dead is a group of twenty-somethings travel to a remote island to attend the rave of the century . When they get there they only find some tents a bar a stage and some bloody t-shirts. They decide to stay anyway and they are soon attacked by zombies. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. It is not entertaining. Instead it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is. The acting is unbelievably bad. In a DVD interview one of the actors claimed that Uwe Boll the director is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene. This is a blatant lie. The script appears to have been written by an 11-year-old who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line it smells like someone farted out here. The characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie. Somewhere along the way the characters also magically transform into a SWAT team to take down the zombies. It's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head. The scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing. There is something wrong with Uwe Boll. Boll's camera work is astonishingly disjointed. His pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing. Worse yet Boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the House of the Dead video game into the movie. Quite often and at the most random times you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot. It makes no sense. No one in their right mind would think that was a good idea. It's like Boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game. Uwe Boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes a la 'The Matrix'. Unfortunately he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating. The soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind. Most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track. This also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious 'House of the Dead'. 'House of the Dead' isn't bad because it's based on a video game. In fact it has very little to do with the video game. It also does not fit into the category of 'so bad that it's good'. It does however fit into the category of 'so bad that it's painful'. This movie just plain sucks. Uwe Boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set. Even his presence will curse a production. To all the directors out there: whenever one of your movies gets a bad review all you have to do is remember that you didn't make 'House of the Dead' and you will feel much better. I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. To sum it up words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is. Everyone involved in the production of this film especially Uwe Boll should be ashamed of themselves. Although what I have said may make 'House of the Dead' sound funny it really isn't. Nothing about it is funny. Avoid this at all costs. ",negative
" As far as films go this is likable enough. Entertaining characters good dialogue interesting enough story. I would have really quite liked it had I not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in. Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet every character is English (save for Sean's girlfriend who is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs & roles. As a Scottish woman (& as a viewer who likes her real life films to be a bit more like real life) I really don't think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented Scottish actors...or at least got English ones who could toss together a decent accent! The futile attempt at using the word wee a few times did nothing but to further the insult. ",negative
" I don't like Sean Penn's directing very much and this early work The Indian Runner is no exception. The movie has no core it's colored with a kind of redneck anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penn's work his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller Robert Rodriguez Clint Eastwood Sean Penn the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty but ending up being for the most part glorified pro wrestling matches and moralistic almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hell's Angels greetings and make me long for the days of Deliverance which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg and that's about it. The movie is dead meaningless and seems to be an exercise a series of techniques more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson however who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap. ",negative
" The only reason I elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film. As far as I could tell Borgnine was the ONLY actor in it. The other performances were so uniformly terrible I am amazed a studio would actually pay the performers to appear. Couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that I thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled and you have a perfect cinematic disaster. Obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children and to its credit it was better than most of the original programing on the Disney Channel and similar kid-focused networks. But honestly that is not saying much. ",negative
" I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark's worst film There is so much wrong with this film. First off some of the acting is great in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully' and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name) but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids' but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. No sorry a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't fathom Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence? It sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv. I'm no prude but I didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I don't think he'll ever top it. ",negative

" Now I like sci-fi cartoons. However when Robotboy appeared in Canada in late 2006 I watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled. The characters are generic and stereotypical (Do they REALLY need to make an African-American man wear tiger-stripe print clothing and speak in a Jamacian accent? WHY are all the Asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting? Does the mother HAVE to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain?) to the point where things become unrealistic predictable gross and sometimes disturbing. There are heavy similarities to even stabs at Astro Boy. Allow me to explain (dub names for the young): Robotboy/Astro Kamikaze/Tenma Constantine/Shadow Gus/Abercrombie Tommy/Alejo Lola/Zoran+Kennedy Moshimo/O'Shay and it so on. Brief resemblances to My Life As A Teenage Robot Star Wars Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kamen Riders Sailor Moon and co. are afoot. Not to mention the abundant racial/gender stereotyping. Don't even get me started on the innuendos. I'll just say they're hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Don't even try watching this. Especially if you like Astro Boy. ",negative
" If the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading.

I am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie. Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span.

" This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies that play on it. I really don't know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo/theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar. What was it oh yeah Jurassic Park. But this has Sabertooth tigers instead. The movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up dieing a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked a lot like ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists or the people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand. Again sound like Jurassic Park. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000lb saber tooth who crawled around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the guys neck. Funniest death I've seen on TV. The acting is extremely cheesy the special effects are horrible. The CG tigers could almost pass for clay models and even some of the sounds were off. For instance when one of the college students is trying to escape he uses an ax to break down a door the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. The cheesy deaths were quite funny though. ",negative
" Every year I watch hundreds of films including many low budget amateurish straight-to-DVD abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see. I have seen thousands of films in my time many excellent many forgettable. Zombie Nation I will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable 'horror' films I have ever seen  in fact I still haven't recovered from the experience of watching it. The day after it seems like some kind of weird dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why do the police work out of a warehouse? Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? I wouldn't recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a 'good' film and neither would I recommend it as 'so bad its good'. However if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever  this is for you. Now whenever anyone asks me what the worst film I have ever seen is I will say Zombie Nation. Seriously  I think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude. He really is the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age and I for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one. ",negative
" ...and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way. First of all it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes. Your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here. Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out. Now I love horror movies and I am very 'pro-violence' but I do think that it has to lead somewhere !! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts. The movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story. This results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common. Not very informative if you ask me. And yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely HAS potential. It's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial. Personally I think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever. Secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess. They didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts...Tons of it !! The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I've ever seen. Any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish ( Like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example ). There's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere...not even an attempt to build up one. Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least. With the presence of death-metal icon Danni Filth ( from the band Cradle of filth..get the link ? ) this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial. Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this. And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing...Bah. I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind. For every self-respecting horror fan this movie is an insult. ",negative
" I read the book Celestine Prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie. Be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book. Many of the book's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie. It is a B movie at best. Many events characters how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur. The flow of events that in the book are very smooth are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child. The character development is very poor. Personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to a B horror flick. I understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book but they screen play base missed many points. The casting was very good. ",negative
" As with many other pop-culture franchise series this line just didn't know when to quit. Instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended they went on to generate this; the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark. This movie should never have happened. It was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line and it sure shows. The premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same. After the wonderful experience which was The Omen this was a major disappointment which stank of 70's cheese and horrible acting. It was reminiscent of the Amityville Horror in those aspects and left a terrible lingering stench long after it was over. It rates a 1.4/10 from... the Fiend :. ",negative
" The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There's not much thought behind it but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funnier ones in the movie). Other than that the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies but I've seen dumber ones too. Again it's not exactly a deep movie but it's good for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skit though. But still if you're looking for a pretty funny movie I'd recommend this one. Just don't think about it too much or you'll hate it. Rating: 6/10 ",negative
" this could be one of the worse movies i've ever seen. i don't see how could this ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller? its more like a lumbering drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT but since there weren't any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs. the movie had so much potential. they had beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them. they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant. this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different.

" Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands. The doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that'll return his lost memories if it works. But when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon he chooses to escape instead. While outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) mistreats his mother won't let her near the darkroom in his basement & acts suspicious in general. While the general 'mystery' of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it's revealed I found Mr. Diamond's acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout. (In the interest of full disclosure I've been a huge fan of his since Homicide and his brief but extremely pivotal role in The Shield up through Journeyman & Dollhouse) Not a great film nor a good one but serviceable enough. Although I did like it better than the previous films that I've seen from Director/writer Michael Hurst (Room 6 Pumkinhead 4 Mansquito) Eye Candy: one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination My Grade: C- ",negative
" And the Oscar for the most under-rated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye. Seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as Karloff Lugosi and Price and this movie proves it. His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I can give to watch this movie. Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie. The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. Being in the medical profession myself I have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self-pity prone hypochondriac. Though other medical mistakes did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication... Well continue giving it to her Unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie. The plot is predictable with only few minor twists. The filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn - yes you can use too much shadow. My recommendation - watch this once to see Frye and Eburne - but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine. ",negative
" This Lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity. Here the 40 something stay-at-home ex-wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter away at college) is starting a new life after her divorce helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal. She has even started up a friendship with her attractive slightly younger perhaps landscape architect / gardener (who's black). But then horror of middle-aged women's horrors ANOTHER 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to starts 'taking over her life. What this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that * gasp * really belonged to the divorcee!! She runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat!! And backed up the toilet! And leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator! And hangs her pieces of (African) artwork in the living room!! And so on. Well she may have killed the cat as well. Yeah ok the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough but its more than a little ridiculous especially as it turns into a campaign. The character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane. (So why did she rent the room -- and to horror of horrors a much younger woman?) Supposedly this increasingly arrogant (natch) younger woman has a mania for seizing control. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil (and erotically hot looking of course) 20 something. But there's this problem. Anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her POWER -- and just flirts or has sex with some guy and escapes the consequences. (Well there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. It just isn't * generally * used in quite this sort of way.) The premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her. Of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things and the 20 something has had help. The lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period with utilities thrown in at the fixed price. Even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something. You know the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing. Finally the 40 something's heroic battle back for THE HOUSE then begins. Woopie!! The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy TRO's (or orders of protection) are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so -- although they are generally only this easy against men. They are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. Indeed girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats and sometimes without even hearing his side. Even when there is a hearing it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats (to prove a negative) when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused rather than the accuser. (This is one of the only areas of American law where that is true -- and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course that's not likely to be the subject of any Lifetime movie in this lifetime. The absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and isn't taking her medicine. Even so it makes no sense. She isn't after the successful lawyer ex-husband though she does con his help (to the ex wife's fury) in her quest. She's after THE HOUSE (technically to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease). This second younger woman is after ALL THAT'S LEFT after the divorce after affairs with other 20 somethings STOLE her husband!! (The ex-husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling -- doesn't matter he still strayed!!!) The protagonist is good enough looking for her age. But her outlook attitude and focus is so small minded frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her. Well a core group of Lifetime fans care I guess judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it. (I kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal. I couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it.) ** Spoiler ** (if such a thing is possible with this flick). Well here's a clue. The movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to listen to her 20 something male co-worker and sometimes lover and do whatever he says and let him take care of her (he means get her to keep taking her medicine) -- and then tricking him and returning to THE HOUSE. There she climbs the stairs with a knife demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something who is taking a bath by candlelight secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life. There's a struggle -- and the 40 something mom wins -- by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti-psychotic medicine she had found. She then begins stroking her mom like and the two women have a bonding female solidarity moment!!! How sweet. ",negative
" First this film is not a thriller. Neither is it gripping taut. It might have been so based on the script but the direction's slow pace makes it difficult to get into. The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately we only get a sense of *how* ingenious after the picture is over. That leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer and cunning vixen scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence. I wish this had been the fast-paced thriller the box promised. It would've been an outstanding film. Instead Spike Lee made it plod along through the end. ",negative

" A lot of death happens in the wild. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out! But does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary? What is with this fascination with gruesome death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions? Or a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion no less! I thought this was going to be a family-friendly nature film! And why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film's trailers? Were the filmmakers afraid of losing money? Then in typical comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent Birds-of-Paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of First and Second graders on a school field trip! Wow! From the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat! If there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review why not focus on: Animals actually copulating; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socializing; playing; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors like mouth brooding; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; parenting healing abilities etc. In other words stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty and why not be much more well-rounded - and focus on delight and inspiration instead?

" I got this DVD well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday. I don't know why it took me so long as I do like the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and the Gadgetinis. While it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie there are some old things missing that bog this Gadget right down the toilet. First of all the classic Inspector Gadget theme song and music is completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it's still just no good enough. The Gadget-mobile is now a talking car not a car that can turn into a van. Plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain hardly make an appearance at all. The plot is non-existent. There's something about a transformation formula and Doctor Claw using for some never revealed evil but that's all I got. What the deal was with the short/giant Italian guy I will never know. It had nothing to do with anything. And if the title is anything to go by his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever. And he stays on the force so why it's called 'last case' is a mystery also. I wasn't impressed at all. This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD but don't let that prompt you into buying whatever Inspector Gadget DVDs you can. I sold this mere seconds after finally watching it. No kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it. ",negative
" The idea is nice. Bringing so many stars in one movie is great. But.... too many stories too short and lacking really any sense. No connection between the scenes. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories... but these were out of 18. The frame reminded me of All the invisible children - a movie which I liked a lot. Compared to it however Paris Je T'Aime lacks the intriguing short story which develops - starts and has its end. And it lacks the topic connecting all those - children. I do not find Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together.Perhaps for people who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it... ",negative
" Deep Shock plays out like a TV movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors a poorly designed creature to be the bad guy and a script that is more full of technical political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with. I checked out the movie because of the creature (I love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos) and right off the bat I got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. The actors I expected because of the type of film it is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point). The music was typical not-thought-out action symphonic music. I liked the design of the computers and technical equipment along with the mini-sub design. The movie even flowed really well with guiding screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in. But there isn't much of a story here anyways. This movie gets a 3/10 stars IMO. The boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting it...kinda lame. Even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming. Chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors' careers off the bench and into a video. Don't bother. ",negative
" I'm sure this was one of those WOAH! attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened but now it's just silly. The film's message is cliché. The Circle-Vision is disorienting. And that awful song at the end is grating. And I really wish they'd install seats. After so much walking all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous! You get entertained while sitting down right? WRONG! You're standing there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short little railing. Disney should make a newer Maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull lackluster film. NOT FUN. Skip it. In fact skip Canada altogether unless you're eating there. Move directly to the United Kingdom. ",negative
" Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie. I first saw ads for this movie back in 2001. It looked like it could be funny but I wasn't about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first. I figured I would wait until the movie was available to rent at Blockbuster. About a year and a half later I was at Tower Records and in the DVDS for less than $20 pile there was a copy of this movie. Seeing that the DVD was only $6.99 I decided to buy it. I got home put the disc in the DVD player and waited for the laughs to start...and I waited some more. The laughs never came. I'd have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this movie was horrible. Sick desperately tasteless and poorly written and directed THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time. No stars. ",negative
" When I caught a glimpse of the title I thought are we going to get another try-hard hip slasher but actually I found 7eventy 5ive to be a mildly passable and almost 80s throwback after a tediously slow mid-section it picks up momentum for the final half-hour leading to it's outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending. It won't win awards for originality because it's as systematic as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills (usual cheap jump scares) location (secluded mansion) and motivation from other films. The gleaming direction is by-the-book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script. Sometimes laughable but nonetheless I was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence towards some rather obnoxiously annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe. The performances weren't bad in the shape of a spunky young cast however the characters they were portraying weren't particularly enticing. An always presentable Rutger Hauer shows up in a short supportive role as a grizzled detective. A slickly made but a shallow and forgettable addition to the fold. ",negative

THIS IS NOT CINEMA FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou about David Lynch about Forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness.

" Released in 1965 but clearly shot years earlier this is an inept little crime melodrama with some inept sexploitation up front. As usual for grindhouse flicks of era there's a fair amount of undressing and dressing for no reason complemented by lousy music annoying narration and awkward editing. The coffee shop scene lays the excruciating groundwork as we chop back and forth between characters to avoid actually seeing them speak their lines. All we get are reaction shots to the off-screen character's voice! 50s-pretty Misty Ayers strips to her French-cut panties a couple of times before the action gets started. She's accompanied continuously by what is apparently stock music from romantic to western to mother-does-the-dishes mixed randomly to produce among other things the most thrilling cigarette lighting ever captured on film. Watch as he taps it! Watch as he strikes the match! Will he inhale or will he be captured by Apaches? Only time will tell!! The film tells the sordid tale of how Sally gets tricked into working in a whorehouse falls for a dope and can't escape. For some reason we're treated to some of the most bored and boring hookers ever committed to film literally doing their nails or knitting rather than entertaining the clientèle. Some stupendously lame comedy (boozy dame accidentally drinks milk! Har dee har!) and silent film acting doesn't help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen even on the Something Weird Video marquee. It's really more of a film curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema--very bad cinema.

But S.I.C.K. has horrible acting lame porn music throughout the whole thing and even the sex scenes sucked! I would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of Twin Dragons Puppet Master vs the Demonic Toys or even a Very Brady Sequel . Although this is by far worse then any of those. I beg you don't even waste your time. Believe me its 2 hours you'll never get back. ",negative
" While I totally disagree with one reviewer who described Charley Chase as unfunny in this film he certainly is. It's a shame as I suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few Charley Chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny. Films like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY? are very good Chase films so he COULD be really funny given good material. Unfortunately in this film he's given absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the usually good Oliver Hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise (boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame as I really wanted to love this film but couldn't. By the way for those used to the look for Charley from the mid-1920s on you'll be pretty surprised as Chase sports no glasses or mustache--and looks very little like you'd expect. ",negative
" I can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad. It's like the TV station are desperate for anything anything at all. They're buried underneath a bunch of snow the electricity constantly flashes on and off yet magically there is a background light that stays constant. Where does all this (fake) light come from? That and all that stupid bickering between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. It tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping. But because it's such bad directing and acting you will not your Florence Nightingale fix with this flick sorry.

" I got this movie out of Blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks. I'd have to say I got my money's worth on this one. I had expected horrible dialogue crappy monsters and shaky cameras. Well as Meatloaf said two outta three ain't bad. The acting is bad though not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've watched so many low budget movies recently I've lost perspective. There are some bits were the acting is downright terrible but for the most part it's of at least High School Play level. The CG for the Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second-worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in an ape suit would have been better. Clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better. So you may be asking why I call the CG the second-worst part. That's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects. They are loud annoying and constant. I've been camping I know what insects sound like in the woods at night and while they can be loud they're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie. Usually when the background sounds drown out the movie's dialogue it's a bad thing but from what I caught of the dialogue of this film I wasn't missing much. The action was infrequent and boring. The tension was non-existent as was any sense of empathy with the characters. Speaking of the characters they were all cookie-cutter and bland. The only mildly engaging byplay was between...actually I can't think of anything. There was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile but that was about it. The cinematography was decent a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this. However it still had that home movie quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer. If you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks and you see this one in the dollar bin think about grabbing it. Otherwise stay away at all costs. ",negative
" This little show is obviously some stupid little prequel/spin off of the original series. Compared to the live action series this show is utter crap. The live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines. While the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap. The storyline in every episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. Thats basiclly the idea every episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave. This then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were Gem says just adore me for now and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god. (which is quite right since he's her mind control slave) But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or the effort. ",negative
" What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. During the first season Dark Angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of Jessica Alba. Unfortunately the powers-that-be over at Fox decided that they needed to fine-tune the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season episodes they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.

" here was no effort put into Valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so. I've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies including everything from Halloween to Prom Night to Carrie and as much as I hate to be redundant the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything. The punch bowl over poor Jeremy's head early in the film is so obviously taken from Carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie (`Hey everyone this is the director and the following is my Carrie-rip-off scene. Enjoy!'). But that's just a suggestion. (spoilers) The film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured. We get to know some girl briefly at the beginning she gets killed people wonder in the old oh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people tone and then THEY start to get killed. The problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful but they have no idea how to do it. Take Jason for example. Here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor Jeremy was treated he is assumed to carry some significance. Besides that and more importantly he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious Valentine's Day cards. It is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects and Jason is a perfect example of the effort but not such a good example of a successful effort. Sure I thought for a while that he might very well be the killer but that's not the point. We know from early on that he is terrible with women which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film but then in the middle of the film he appears at a party smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls and then gives them a hateful look and walks away disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation. We already know he is a cardboard character but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him. On the positive side the killer's true identity was in fact made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also unfortunately yet another rip-off. Early in the film when Shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel he makes no sound suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female rather than a male as everyone suspects. But then for the rest of the film we just have this stolid relentless unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife. Director Jamie Blanks (who with all due respect looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade) mentions being influenced by Halloween. This is of course completely unnecessary because it's so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film. The only difference between the killer in Valentine and Michael Meyer's is that Michael's mask was so much more effective and he didn't have a problem with nosebleeds. This stuff is shameless. At the end there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is (complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is' mask removal) but then we see Adam's nose start to bleed as he holds Kate his often reluctant girlfriend and we know that he's been the killer all along. Nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film. Valentine is not scary (I watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight and I have been afraid of the dark for as long as I can remember and even I wasn't scared) and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren't so obvious that they were just going to die. I remember being impressed by the theatrical previews (although the film was in and out of the theater's faster than Battlefield Earth) but the end result is the same old thing. ",negative
" If you're looking to be either offended or amused or both you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés. At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through the contrived mess. Beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the CBC typically excels at producing. And once the ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO!! hype wears out its welcome the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone. Unless you're obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really don't see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight. ",negative
" This third Pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids. The message of the film-- about dealing with loss-- is subverted by the return of the young girl's father during the film's credits. Team Rocket provide some amusement but they're not really part of the small plot so they don't appear very often. ",negative
" My one line summary should explain it all but I'll have a go at it. From the get-go this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera and that's about all I can comment on. There were a few interesting scenes such as the Big one that hit during the middle of the movie but wait what's that? The earthquake *gasp* wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well parts of it butchered and slapped in. I can't believe how poorly this movie was done borrowing scenes from other much better films. One wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA ala Dante's Peak. My advise forget the Bond Wanna-be Nash in this film and go for the real thing (again someone from Dante's Peak coincidentally.) ",negative
" I couldn't believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It starts very slowly the backgrounds of the Nuremberg trials become clear step by step the Germans have a funny English accent but then suddenly in the last few minutes of the first part of the series the audience gets to see the most shocking horrific footage I have ever seen. It is important that people get to see such footage (although I absolutely don't agree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this kind of material) but in this film it was completely ridiculous. It was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary TV series. It was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and unbelievably easy. In stead of trying to move us with well-done scenes inspiring dialogue or interesting viewpoint's the audience is being tortured with horrible images of skin-and-bones camp inmates. It doesn't show any respect for the victims of the holocaust. I'm very angry. ",negative
" How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better Flemish movie Congo Express (1986) ? There are also some characters in congo Express put together without having really a relation to each other: Jean (de Congolees) the workman the two taxi-drivers the street-singer Roger Guy Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels wasn't. That should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script (if there is a script) of Anyway the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great Flemish movie De Witte (1934) where De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after. Tom Barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres. Another missed chance for Flemish Cinema. ",negative
" Regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time (certainly the biggest stinker of director Brian De Palma's career). Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. His story is chronicled by another smug guy reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). Well as I said in my summary... What is this movie supposed to be? It seems to combine comedy drama and satire but it sure doesn't add up to much. It's undermined by unimaginably loathsome one-dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life. I'm no big fan of the novel (I started reading it once but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking) but it's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty. I've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail. What a waste. The problems start with casting nice guy Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be UNsympathetic. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Brit. Bruce Willis is badly BADLY miscast in the role. What was the thinking there. Alas not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact being obliged to deliver a lame heavy-handed lecture on 'decency' after the climax. This movie ends up turning into an absurd farce. I liked the assemblage of talent; for that I will give it four out of ten but I'm sure some people will say a MUCH better movie could have been made from the source material. ",negative
" Please avoid this movie at all costs. This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. Most movies have at least one redeeming value. This has none. Totally horrible! ",negative
" This movie does not rock as others have said. I found it really boring and silly. The story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer. The singer dies but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at of course midnight on Halloween (which would actually make it November 1st a much less potent date to be sure). The kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back-play messages. It also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world. The first part of this film is not a horror film at all but rather an After School Special. We see the metal kid (the outsider) tormented over and over by the popular kids. And he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies: When the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party DON'T GO! It is a trap. Especially if it is a pool party. Anybody surprised when he ends up in the water?? It was such an After School Special that I kept waiting for Melissa Sue Anderson to show up and teach Jody Foster a lesson. So back to the horror part of the film. So this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys (which would have made much more sense) he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm. What? A sensitive hero? What fun is that in a horror movie? Thank goodness Carrie White did not follow this lesson. He actually tries to PREVENT having the music played at the Halloween Dance the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him. If it were me I would have put that music on and pronto. The rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized. Why not partner with him and REALLY do some damage. Why you ask? It seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt..more appropriate for a Molly Ringwald film. Is this a horror film or an episode of Beauty and the Beast? The movie just goes on and on at this point with no scares horror or anything worth watching. If you went to high school in the late 80s like I did this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair but that is it for this film. Skip it and stay home and just listen to some KISS. ",negative
" As I sat in front of the TV watching this movie I thought Oh what Alfred Hitchcock or even Brian DePalma could have done with this! Chances are you will too. It does start out intrigueing. A British park ranger living in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a pretty demure brunette woman (Lisa Zane) whom he met in a park only a short time ago. Then one day she dissappears. The police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed and Firth conducts his own search. So far so good. Just as he's about to give up he turns to his womanizing best friend (Billy Zane) and they stumble onto her former life in L.A.'s sordid underground of drugs nightclubs and ametuer filmmaking and then to her history of mental instability. At that point Firth's life is in danger and the film falls apart. None of the characters from Lisa Zane's past are remotely interesting. The film moves slowly and there's very little action. There is a subplot regarding missing drug money but it's just a throwaway. No chases no cliffhanging sequences and no suspense. Just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters. One thing worth noting Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister but they never appear in a scene together. By the end of the movie you're torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake. ",negative
" This movie could have been great(cause its got a somewhat fascinating premise) but it never rises above sheer caricature.

Never and I mean never Watch this godawfull piece of .... Danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of .... crosses the border I'm afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie.

" After just finishing the book the same day I watched the movie I knew what was supposed to happen. I had high expectations of the movie because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. I have a couple main points for not liking this movie. ********** SPOILERS ********** 1. The casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits into Jack Torrence's character. Also I would have NEVER picked Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I pictured Wendy much differently. I can see why they picked Jack Nicholson though the grin the pointy eyebrows but he's not supposed to really look 'evil'. He's supposed to look normal and he turns evil. Also they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was alright he needed more life though. He acted way to droney. 2. The screenplay. They cut out so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted changed or handled wrongly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals the roque mallet the elevator) were not in the movie and it was 2 and half hours!! I was extremely irritated. 3. The Ending. The ending was changed completly Halorann died Jack froze to death Wendy never got hurt...The Overlook didn't blow up. The Ending was so cool in the book and the movie messed it up so horribly I was apalled. Hallorann was never supposed to die but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him at least have Jack use a roque mallet. You never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie. There are other things that I didn't like about the movie but there are things that were all right. The camera angels were cool the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool but maybe I was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book to try to be scared at all. I reccomend reading the book before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis Stanley Kubrik any more. I would never have done that I would have taken all the rights I could get to yell at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6 hour version at least it has the hedge animals. Rating: 2/10 ",negative
" Miraculously this is actually quite watchable. I mean it's bad. It's really bad. But whereas the original was so-bad-it's-ruining-my-life bad this is so-bad-it's-mildly-entertaining bad. Right that's enough faint praise. Production values are rotten across the board the acting is excruciating and the Romero-wannabe satire can't make its mind up which side of the ecology fence it's mocking. Internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges virus incubation times fluctuating as the 'plot' requires bullets working against the zombies or not zombies having the power of speech or not. Gore is the draw obviously but the framework is so slapdash it's annoying. The dialogue sounds like it's been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of Romero's films. It's all topped off with a horrendous synth score. Absolute rubbish. ",negative
" This piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production? Poor film making aside the story is vile just sick evil sh*t If you like rape murder and self harm this is right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed. I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someones brains blown out. Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty. ",negative
" The original Trancers is not by any means a great movie. It had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic. However it was entertaining better done than most low-budget B-movies and could be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately Trancers II is none of these. Trancers II suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels. The plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid. It seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough and didn't bother with anything else. Not even veteran B-grade actors like Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs were able to drag this film out of the muck. A brief plot overview: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a cop from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of members of his government. Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt) the woman he met in the first movie and both live with Hap Ashby the man Deth was sent into the past to protect. It is discovered that the brother of Whistler (the bad guy from the first movie) has traveled back in time to create an army of Trancers people turned into mindless killing zombies to kill Ashby. Complicating Jack's mission is the fact that his first wife who had died long before Jack traveled to the past was also sent back to stop Whistler's brother and now Jack finds himself working with her. I have two real problems with this movie. One is that the method of creating Trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie. What makes it annoying is that in a rather poor example of Soviet Revisionism they act like it was always the technique. The other thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between Deth Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) is given very little screen time. This bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie. It felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie. Alice's character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find he's re-married making her either very shallow or very poorly written. The only reason I can think of for watching this movie is if you're interested in watching the entire Trancers series (currently totaling six movies). Otherwise even if you're a fan of the original Trancers stay away from this tepid sequel. ",negative
" My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this. I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared so I assume it was rejected even though it met all the usual guidelines. I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as Blow and The Alamo. Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art. An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere anytime. ",negative
" *McCabe and Mrs. Miller* takes place in the turn-of-the-century Pacific Northwest. Into a soggy muddy mining camp John McCabe (a hirsute Warren Beatty) comes barging full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon/whorehouse for the town replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history. He also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger: too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alpha-male credentials amongst the locals. And thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour. It looks to be a rather sorry operation until Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie) shows up on a startling contraption that's half-railroad car half-automobile (where did Altman find that thing?). Mrs. Miller immediately takes on McCabe as a business partner with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering. Noting that McCabe doesn't know how to add she also insists on handling the accounts. It's not clear what McCabe's function will be. The plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer McCabe to buy him out for five grand. McCabe tells them to buzz off -- he's holding out for fifteen thousand. The company finds negotiation distasteful so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill McCabe . . . though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as McCabe's function in the whorehouse partnership. (Excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk doesn't cut the mustard when one considers that any reward-money offered by the local Marshal would be pretty tempting.) *McCabe and Mrs. Miller* purportedly classic Seventies cinema should be a lot better than it is. The movie tells a pretty good story; the main characters have the potential to be interesting. There are some striking scenes especially one involving what looks to be a 14-year-old stone-cold killer. But it's really really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing. Once again this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness. According to the trivia-sheet here on IMDb the movie's editor griped to Altman that the sound was muddy; Altman disagreed; and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movie's release Altman blamed the editor. (Nice.) Along with the bad sound the movie has an atrocious look. Only Robert Altman can hire a world-class DP like Vilmos Zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater. Reviewers here who praise the dark brown glow of this picture have GOT to be kidding me. The interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum. The exterior photography is even worse: it's as if Altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees. During the climactic stretch when Beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire Altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snow-fall that reminds one of a Rankin-Bass Christmas special. Look -- I can't watch a movie under these conditions. Get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes when you remove all that annoying Altman-esque overlapping dialog and when you wipe the lenses with some Windex or something. 3 stars out of 10.

" Having seen the first ten episodes I must say this show sucks. What bothers me the most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper but they should have shot it in California so we could have had scenes in the desert. That would have been more true to the movie. The first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold. That does'nt feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a Canadian forrest. And it's so lame that appaerantly on other planets the fall comes as well. You can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside Vancouver. It just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb. And then there is Richard Dean Anderson. He is no Kurt Russel. Sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russels performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as Russel. And not nearly as good an actor as Russel. And Russells way of playing O Neill well he was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil is way too soft. I liked it that Russels version just did'nt give a s*** and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie. Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson though taking over from James Spader. Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh!! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. Teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot. I've seen better acting from Jean Claude Van Damme. And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb. What made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. As for the special effects they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background. It's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap. Especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. The X-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before SG-1 started. And they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that SG-1 supposedly had. They must have spend all the money on catering. Because I don't see it on the screen. Incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters. ",negative
" I really wish that when making a comedy the people actually tried to make it funny. This is a film that you can sit through but nothing is special about it. After watching it you will say that it was alright. It was not boring to watch but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. This movie wanted to be Tootsie but instead it failed. I gave it a 1 out of 10. ",negative
" I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 Oscars which it was awarded. Unfortunately it really isn't a good movie. The depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard. The actors put in a good effort but for me I didn't really get what the movie was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and gripping as Full Metal Jacket not as epic as Band of Brothers not as action packed as...well anything. I certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much nor why people are 'hyping it up' to these epic proportions. Mind you given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years I suppose there's not a lot to choose from. ",negative
" This movie deserves credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling. Unfortunately it falls flat on all levels. The films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything; it has camp moralistic and epic elements without ever committing to any of them. As for the story itself Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable unbearably innocent Percival into a most ungallant and rude churl. Most likely two types of people will see this francophiles or Arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the latter I found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story. ",negative
" I have been watching horror movies since I was 5 years old beginning with Childs Play.Since then I have seen good horror movies and bad but this is without question the DUMBEST movie I have ever seen! The actors did all they could with the material. The plot was just idiotic. Plus it was just all gore. I can stomach a lot of blood but that was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines! Plain Stupid! Another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end of it is just dumb. But then again it goes with the rest of it! At the end when the girl gets away from the cannibal/ancestor she receives help from a old lady. The old lady is making tea but when she turns around to talk to the girl the girl attacks her! She turned into a cannibal! Retarded movie. ",negative
" This is another one of those movies that could have been great. The basic premise is good - immortal cat people who kill to live etc. - sort of a variation on the vampire concept. The thing that makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive - look how long it took to catch the Unibomber and that was because a family member figured it out. By contrast the kid (and to a lesser extent the mom) behave as though they're untouchable. The kid kills without a thought for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness. How these people managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable let alone decades or centuries. It's really a shame - this could have been so much more if it had been written plausibly i.e. giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to get by for so long. Other than that not a bad showing. I loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house - every time I put out food on the porch and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before I think of that scene.

" Like most people I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film especially the film makers were then attacked aspect that the case seems to emphasize what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob. Then to watch the film and discover oh what they mean by the film makers were attacked was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said Someone should beat those two kids up. The picture on the cover the chase as it were? Total fabrication. Which I guess ties in with the theme of the film lying and manipulation to satisfy vain stupid children with more money and time then sense. I have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film. It's like Michael Moore's Roger & Me but if Roger & Me was Moore mocking the people of Flint. It's completely misdirected and totally inane. Wow! Can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of Communism would be really excited to have markets full of food? What jerks! And it's not so much Look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors it was that as many people in the film say the prices were absurdly low someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck. That's not proving anything except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices bravo fellas way to stick it to the people on the bottom. Way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people. You should be very proud. How about for your next movie you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say HAHA! NO SUCH HOUSE EXISTS! YOUR SO STUPID AND LOVED TO BE LIED TO BY THE MEDIA! .

" Well I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is excellent the lip syncing is awful and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on only to realize nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters only pity for the creators for wasting their time. I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time!

" I am a lover of B movies give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven. These movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead which was so awful I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark-man which the movie barely touched on. In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what fabulous special effects). Back to the science I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and I'm sorry to say pretty bad acting. Not even William Forsythe Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stinker. ",negative
" In my opinion this movie advances no new thought. seems to me like taking a spear to a spear without looking to the side! the director seems to have an agenda! Duh! I find that his rational is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view. I for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie lacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man/woman on the street. really now if you wish to cr5eate a credible alternative to a creed held onto for 2000+ years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs. I'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith I for one am a non believer but allow for the beliefs of others and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate.

" I watched this film not really expecting much I got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right they were all terrible this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer i.e damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot I thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and I haven't even mentioned the killer I'm not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I'm concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasn't because of their acting talent I've certainly seen a lot worse but I've also seen a lot better. Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry. ",negative
" The Lady in Cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60's. The writing not the acting is at center stage. Did I say - pure camp! Prepare to be offended if you are female or gay. Broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day (camp- wise). Most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors. The action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see Dan Blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers. Amazing to note they were both 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53. The musical score wait . . . was there a score? Well you get the point. Watch it with friends who want a good laugh. it's full of them. ",negative
" Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought nothing would ever dethrone Last Action Hero but this does easily. The movie is about 3 single guys who meet on Sundays to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend. A fourth guy - who is married and - that used to be a part of the group shows up and talks about what he and his wife do. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable. Avoid at all costs. ",negative
" Blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense. At one point some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels exploring. They begin to discuss what they'll find down there and one of them (a girl) says she bets they'll find a blue monkey. Yes thats it. Totally inconsequential to the story the only sad connection to the title and no idea why she would suppose she'd find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement. I'm embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember I suppose! ",negative
" If you have beloved actors Peter Falk Rip Torn George Segal and Bill Cobbs you don't need Billy Burke Coolio or any other distractions. Massive talent is totally wasted in Three Days to Vegas with the blame falling squarely on the script. My neighbor's vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie. If you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script check out The Crew . There really are no redeeming factors here and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it but the shallow script cheats the audience by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with. - MERK ",negative
" I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like. Definitely The Broken is not one of those movies. I have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations I've read in prior comments they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people. the photo on the cover clearly shows that the Broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain. It's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless. So you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before. Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue. Had the clues been planted more in the movie one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed. But though the movie was so slow in pace it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all. And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments. Furthermore if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end then how come she is the evil one? I bet I can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion: This movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time. Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. I am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies. Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages! They're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest I guess. Horror movies should have blood screams intensity skeletons body organs and parts. Because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality. I have watched almost all horror movies and I can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising. Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of. For instance the horror movie Train with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with Hostel it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them. And even if we considered the Broken a movie that has an existential message it is still very poorly presented and the least scary. I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex TV safety/being pampered etc... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me. And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils ecstasy leadership lessons (believe it or not!) entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life as ugly and scary as it may seems Death!

" 96 minutes of this is cruel..and I love the old Munster's. Yes the plot is thing; yes the lines are trite; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan. There is so much 'intrigue' (and I use that word with great pause) that I wonder if it's an old Starsky & Hutch episode. I lost count of the number of times I noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar. Refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60's (ludicrous) the producers simply replace Marilyn & Eddie with younger actors. Why not let them grow and age? The addition of an Addam's Family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the Halloween Party. Grandpa & Herman fly to Transylvania and back in a few hours (preposterous.) Sid Ceaser is the most yes the most unbelievable character (I am including the bad robots) since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish & yiddish but claims to be an ancient Arabic ruler. And yes it looks like the laugh track is missing. In fact there are several spots where there is dead air as if the laugh track was to be inserted later. The actors seem to wait on the faux audience. It's not laughable; it's sad. Oh and the best part! Yvonne DeCarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were. Marilyn says something like: Where could Uncle Herman and Grandpa be? They could have been in an accident. They could have been hit by a car...or a train! Lily says responds with something like: You're Uncle Herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track. What's amazing about this is: Yvonne DeCarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt. He never recovered and this financially devastated her family. (check out Biography's fantastic review of her life and career) This line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her. If you are a real fan of the Munster's then you'll have to RENT this mess. It illustrates how some things are better left alone. Even with the (nearly) original cast this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago. ",negative
" This movie was absolute torture. First of all it's a whopping 4+ hours long! True the Kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for but every single one of those battles need not have been shown. So maybe this is a documentary not a commercial film as advertised. Sure didn't seem like it as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws. The battle sequences were so poorly executed. I am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in Border. Each battle was the exact same as the previous. It was so predictable. (This might be a spoiler.) The whole army marches uphill five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each (they also use the same cussword every time) one of the lead actors is shot someone yells for a stretcher the actor says No don't get a stretcher. That will take 6 men from the battalion and then an actor dies. That exact same thing happens over and over and over again. Oh and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the movie is too big for its own good. Despite such a long movie none of the characters were well developed. The actresses had the most miniscule roles. They all are dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were weeping synchronized. It was so comical. They moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together. The list just goes on and on. I know I'm still forgetting something . Anyways I think I have bashed the film enough that you get the picture. ",negative
" In the days before gore and sex took over real horror films were made. Castle of Blood is in my estimation one of the finest although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. In an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent The Others which was in the theaters a couple of years ago. Director Antonio Margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time Web of the Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno). Why he did this I do not understand although the remake starred Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good in its own right. Perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to American audiences. I do not really know. It is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color. Castle of Blood is excellent Italian Gothic. La Danza Macabra is said to be an unpublished work of Edgar Allen Poe who appears in this film. Poe and Lord Blackwood owner of a haunted castle bet American writer Alan Foster (George Riviere) that he cannot spend All Souls Night in said castle and survive. Foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts. It seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re-enact the crimes they committed in life. Lord Blackwood conveniently forgot to tell Foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next All Souls Night! It does not take Foster and the beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood (portrayed by the incomparable Barbara Steele) long to fall in love even though their romance is doomed because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts. I will not give the ending away but will just say that Castle of Blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story. Comments. This film is greatly atmospheric even by the excellent standards of the Italians. My personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this. In fairness Web of the Spider was fine in its own right even with color and greater brightness. I loved the lingering shots something most modern day directors do not have the patience for. Indeed when Alan first enters the doomed castle we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms. By the time the first ghost appears the audience is thoroughly primed and ready. There is wonderful dialogue between Alan and the ghosts something else not often done in standard ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes very visual for this type of film. Elisabeth's murder and the dance scene (reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962's Carnival of Souls) were particularly good. Sadly few general interest viewers will ever hear of much less see this film. That is a shame for this one is a cut above the rest. I got my copy from Sinister Cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else. For persons interested in this genre it is a must see. ",negative
" Another rape of History This movie is a catastrophe; it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story with bad acting and low budget production. The movie should be 1/3 the time they just dragged the time to make a mini series. The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical the solders log stupid the costumes a catastrophe. The Romans were good in fighting in opened areas one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest in this movie the Romans choose to fight in side the city I mean get real. And by the way Cleopatra was from a Macedonian origin which means a light skinned person. ",negative
" This is really terrible. The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched I would have a suitable reply. I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell. I wouldn't have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me debunk the myths and lies. There is nothing good in the movie. Everything yells tacky. The actress is ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish. Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten. Obviously the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie. I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before. Unforgivable. ",negative
" I went to see this movie with my 17 y.o. daughter. I insisted we go the matinée showing not because I'm a tightwad but just feeling I had. In the NASCAR spirit this is a sponser's dream. SO much blatant advertising it almost qualifies as an info-mercial if it weren't for the so-called acting. Keeping with tradition the Herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines the car is only a 'vehicle' (no pun intended)for this cornball of a motion picture. Earlier Herbie installments (although cheesy as well) were produced during more serious times making them a little easier to digest. Ms. Lohan Disney's reigning drama queen has little acting ability. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would get involved in such a project. Only the snack bar was a bigger ripoff! ",negative
" Start with the script. I have seen cartoons with more depth than Envy . Anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen and was not funny the first time a movie is in deep trouble which Envy certainly is. A movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it. Here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken especially would like to forget this bomb because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies Flirting With Disaster and Duplex immediately come to mind. Be certain that Envy is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings just total nonsense. Envy deserves it's low rating because like it's subject matter it stinks. - MERK ",negative
" There aren't many good things to say at all about Underneath Soderbergh's untrue endeavor into neo-noir. Soderbergh remakes Robert Siodmak's decent noir Criss-Cross faithfully not altering the plot very much at all however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state-of-the-art film noir atmosphere giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places lifestyles and anachronisms. Soderbergh who would later make wonderful crime films like Out of Sight and the Ocean's series with great style and atmosphere takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s. Nightclubs have terrible revoltingly dressed garage bands Peter Gallagher's uninteresting version of Burt Lancaster's anti-hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos TVs and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film. It could've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score more flesh to its characters more than just William Fichtner giving performances that aren't wooden a crisper pace. Unfortunately Underneath has none of these things. Soderbergh a fine director does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time. That disposition works wonderfully when he's helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the George Clooney pictures previously mentioned or a social or character drama like Traffic or sex lies and videotape. With a movie like Underneath it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer. ",negative
" The Hazing is one of them films I always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on IMDb. Yes that's how shallow I am! I don't care if ten million people call it a crap movie the poster looks awesome so I guess I'll just have to see it  Now The Hazing can somewhat be described like its alternate title: curious! The poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller. First of all there's something very wrong with the tagline on the old VHS box I watched. It says: He had good grades a good girl and good buddies  until they put him through the Hazing . That's not the case actually. Protagonist Gilbert Lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship. It takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only buddy he has is a very nerdy Charles Martin Smith (still with hair in this film). Both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious Delts fraternity but during their hazing exam  in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies  Barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg. When Lewis returns with the other frat boys Barney froze to death already. Together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend ski-trip. With Barney's body hidden in the cafeteria freezer Lewis has to cover for him so that Barney's absence doesn't look suspicious. The set-up of The Hazing is quite original and potentially innovative but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better. The tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie even a black one but on the other hand there aren't any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills neither. The soundtrack is cheerful and full of light-headed tunes but that's nearly not enough to make this film a comedy. Around an hour into the film the plot also runs out of steam and idea and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of Lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside. I didn't like the final twist because it's quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after (though admittedly after). The Hazing is not a complete waste of time but still I'm glad I found an ex-rental tape at a friend's house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released DVD. ",negative
" Roman Polanski has made many many movies that are unexceptional. His fame bewilders me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the Water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing safe and/or dull (The Pianist Frantic Oliver Twist The Ninth Gate Pirates). R's Baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out. It's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby). But this is just misconceived horror sap. Everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um thanks for that finale-destroying title) and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. It did not sustain my interest. I find that whatever this movie might have been it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was. Farrow is such a chronic distracted helpless waif/housewife. Her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in the extreme. There's no real ideas in it... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. The Dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential. ",negative
" So the other night I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or Power Passion Murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in it and I thought that had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately it didn't. 1) The plot of the film is really confusing. There are two story lines running simultaneously during the film. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the entire movie I was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me. But it still hasn't. 2) The title of the film says the film will be about Natica Jackson. Well it is sometimes. Like said the film covers two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice. To conclude my story I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. By doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life as I did. ",negative
" This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fast-moving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc. Funny thing is you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police. Nonetheless Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes. Snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines providing much of the humor. The bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters. That includes Woody's girlfriend played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean nice people in this movie. For that reason I can't honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity ",negative
" The character acting is a little stiff as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen. Unfortunately one of the better actresses Jean Simmons (played many bit roles on TV like in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night) dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed. The lead role is Mr Ballard as portrayed by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time. He doesn't do a poor job but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time NOT talking and also NOT acting. Robertson's most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies (starring Tobey Maguire). The plot is predictable. A husband murders his rich wife for her money. thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window (fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him) on the day he is predicted to die no less. The second chauffeur Mr Ballard hires looks a lot like an English mark Hamill. Uncanny really! The only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue. Many minutes pass in quietness no one speaks and few act. It is a shame the MST3K guys never got hold of this movie. It could have been much better if not just as predictable with more dialogue or shorter scenes of 'nothingness'. I kept expecting G'Mork's red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the nothing that inhabits this film. ",negative
" This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I've ever seen. And I'm quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus when the Scriptures (as well the other movies) state differently. It lacks also a very important issue: The Resurrection.. None of the other movies skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event. As Paul says in one of his letters If Christ did not rise from the dead our faith is vain . A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. Finally and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator Jesus WAS NOT a myth. And as a matter of fact he was also a JEW. There are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should I said God become a man) that indeed changed mankind. I strongly advise him(given he is a historian) to read about Flavius Josephus the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century. ",negative

" I only watched this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and featured Claudio Cassinelli an actor I like. I was certainly disappointed. The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for TV ratings has been overdone with Rollerball Logan's Run Blade Runner and the new film Death Race which will certainly suck me in because it stars Jason Statham. This was just a bore for the most part. The Kill Bike action was ridiculous. The training was a snooze-fest. It just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone including Dallas star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. Pick one of the others mentioned and you'll be better off. ",negative
" Ira Levin's Broadway smash comes to the screen with hardly any meat on its bones a mystery plot with just a few tricks and twists but nobody worth caring about. Frustrated writer Michael Caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own; his devious plan may include murdering the talented kid which has Caine's flighty spouse up in arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead with Caine doing everything an actor can to keep the pacing up. Dyan Cannon is miscast as his wife (she's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle portion of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer. These three characters and Irene Worth's bothersome neighbor are so undefined that what happens after the set-up barely even registers until well after the second act has begun. Sidney Lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy the set design unconvincing and poorly-lit and the finale is a total disaster. The actors struggle to give the script some substance but with such thin material all we see are their laborious efforts. *1/2 from **** ",negative

" This movie commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue for that matter). The main character's metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene (being an over-dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from A clockwork orange ) is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his/her goal. At least in my opinion. To wrap it up: shockingly brutal revolting and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. See A clockwork orange or Le pianiste instead. ",negative
" This is truly an awful movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. It is simultaneously bland and offensive with nudity and lots and lots of violence. However the nudity is not that exciting and the violence is repetitive and boring. Also the plot is flimsy at best the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped and the acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. I have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny but it's not. I did not laugh once while watching it nor did I even crack a smile. The makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie and they failed on both counts. Some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad but this is not one of them. ",negative
" About twenty minutes into this movie I was already bored. Quite simply these characters were fairly dull. Occasionally something enjoyable would happen but then things would slow down again. Fortunately my patience was eventually rewarded and the ending to this movie wasn't bad at all. However it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes. So I would say that the movie was mediocre overall and considering all of the talent in the cast I'd call this a disappointment. ",negative
" The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is bad film in every way. The script the dreary pace the lack of depth in any character the pointless sub-plots the dreadful acting the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I found nothing likable enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way. I imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark with its moody lighting long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. If so they failed utterly. It just bored me and I wish I had never watched it. Avoid at all costs. ",negative
" I had read a few positive reviews of this film and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was. Positioned as some cross between an AIDS-related story and some kind of Ghost / Blithe Spirit tale this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be. Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an open relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. Mark is HIV+ and he and Simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore. When Mark dies Simon - who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was much different. But Mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings. Unfortunately Simon is such a selfish SOB it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film. By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic it's too late to care. Mark on the other hand follows in Demi Moore's footsteps from Ghost by crying profusely throughout the movie. There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor a la the TV show Bewitched. But that doesn't last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings. The finale with a gold-plated muscle-boy angel guiding a tearful Mark to heaven while a chastened grief-stricken Simon waves goodbye is just stupefying chiefly because it isn't intentionally funny.

" Absolutely one of the worst movies of the year. The plot is ridiculous the characters poorly developed and the premise irritatingly stupid. It all begins when Michael Keaton fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since Batman loses his beautiful author wife Anna to a car accident possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible VW bugs even though she's supposed to be rich. In his grief Batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby: recording nothing and then watching it. He learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his TV. Pretty soon he starts to see dead people thanks to EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomenon which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders video cameras dead cell phones ( Anna cell calling? But she's...DEAD!...Must be ghosts. Mhmmm. No other possible explanation. I'd better start messing around with this indiscriminately. ) etc. Why they can't just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained. ANyway eventually Batman discovers that he's actually seeing the future and he decides to go help this woman he doesn't know. He gets out of his house just in the nick of time because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves ( D*mn it! Can travel between the living and dead using electronics but I'll be d*mned if we can be on time! Am I right guys? (They nod in bemused agreement). ). He tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie (look hard or you'll miss him!) is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons who in Raiders of the Lost Ark style swoop down and kill him looking like the cartoons that they are. Just then some detectives show up and save the lady. After Batman's funeral he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of EVP is to expose him to it. The little kid just smiles. Nothing phases that dude not even when his dad Batman of course starts talking to TV's. The high-point of the movie was when someone's phone rang and some guy yelled out It's Anna!  ",negative
" I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue doesn't explain the story very well and I was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes. There isn't one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting. I just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love. Also Cate and Heath's love seems very incestuous. They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers. I don't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof. I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films but like I said it's extremely hard to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrid which was a complete shocker. She was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of Edward and there just wasn't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel they were supposed to be our heroines but came off as whiny and overdramatic. I just didn't enjoy this movie very much or the music in it. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band MxPx but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not. I just pictured something so completely different. ",negative
" First of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic Gregory's Girl and Local Hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated. While it's true that sequels are usually bar a few notable exceptions a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a thinly disguised retread of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense. In the case of Gregory's Two Girls Bill Forsyth has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins - on the one hand revisiting the plot of Gregory's Girl while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving Scottish arms dealers. Schoolboy Gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing Dorothy. Although now thirty five Gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing Frances also sixteen despite the fact that music teacher Bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him. His passion for Frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend. There's no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all. The main problem lies with the character of Gregory himself in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old Gregory who actively and comically pursues Dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over. At thirty five Gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and friendless creature whose life is neither active nor comic. Outside of work his time is spent watching videos of Noam Chomsky and reading magazines about international injustices. As his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly vanished save two pointless scenes with his younger sister who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life we are left confused about what it is Gregory really wants who he is and why he is the way he is. Why for example is he friendless? Why does he never see his father who is clearly still alive? Why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended? Why is he so interested in Noam Chomsky and injustice? Why has he become so apathetic? Why is he attracted to Frances? Why isn't he attracted to Bel until the last twenty minutes of the film? What in heaven's name do Bel or Frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting? Why does he continue to try and impress Frances even after he and Bel have become an item and when their association threatens to completely disrupt his life? Are we really to believe that a Scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive regimes could manage to evade media scrutiny but fall foul of a couple of school-kids? Does Gregory really think that dumping a handful of computers into the sea will change anything? To make matters worse actor John Gordon Sinclair attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent Gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language. Unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy. On top of that it's hard to feel any sympathy for or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing pupils while they both lie on a pile of gym mats. Rather than being amusing it simply smacks of paedophilia. It's hard to know what was going through Bill Forsyth's head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic. I can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all.That at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent. As it is Gregory's Two Girls adds up 116 wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and signifying even less. Gregory's Girl was responsible for launching Bill Forsyth's career here's hoping that Gregory's Two Girls won't be responsible for sinking it. ",negative
" What a disappointment... admittedly the best of the prequels but the story is weak the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly. There are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years. I won't complain about the abysmal dialogue as this is Star Wars... the original three films had style cult feeling and cracking stories and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were shallow attempts to make more money and this lack of love shows in spades. Utterly disappointing. ",negative
" I just did not enjoy this film. But then I loved Babe a Pig in the City and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way. The animals were not likeable. They were all irritating especially Chris Rock's guinea pig but then what could I expect it's Chris Rock. I believe I smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines but that's it. ",negative
" I got to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out Aug 3rd. It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father. When we meet him he's jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped yes a mo-ped and almost makes it. This would be worthy of a 'Jackass' movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl-next-door Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother Kevin who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mom Marie. She remarried Frank Powell played by Ian McShane. Frank's a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls. It's clear that Rod's not going to earn Frank's respect till he can beat him. We find out Frank needs a $50 000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass' once he's healed and prove himself a man. A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to 'go big' on one stunt. Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch- at a children's birthday party. There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns out and the world tunes in. Does he make the jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise the $50k? Does Frank get his ass beat by Rod? Wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out. ",negative
" Ever wanted to eat worms? Here's a 'documentary' to show you how! Yeah...The kid eats live worms! And that's about the most interesting part of the movie. This movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring. I'm totally in agreement here. The movie just doesn't go anywhere....unless you're fond of worm eating! This is one movie it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for....because nothing much happens. Now on the technical side: They should have given that kid a haircut. Who's he trying to look like anyway...Bozo the Clown. It was almost comical...I almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something. And on top of that; the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry! Should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming. All in all this movie nearly put me to sleep. And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting. I will admit that the scenery was very impressive. And had there been a decent story to go with it it might have made a hit. It did seem safe enough for kids to watch: The bear scenes and the 'oddball' eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids and the brief 'skinny-dipping' scene didn't show anything. I gave this one a very generous 3. ",negative
" First off I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies but this movie is just like my summary. The Biggest Sack of Crap ever. In the beginning Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who get stage fright at a Comedy Building called the Apollo. On his way home from a gig while riding his BIKE he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a Truck. A little while later he chooses the body of an old white and selfish millionaire. Then he dresses up like the music group Outkast while trying to replay the scene from the original where he comes out as a Jockey. Second he goes back to the Apollo and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body and starts dissing the white population and tries to be black. Do you get my drift? This movie is awful it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a sack of crap. Just take my advice don't even watch this movie. ",negative
" STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat. Meanwhile her mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails. The film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives. It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable and that would include watching films that entertain them this way. Films like Nil by Mouth highlight this. It's a tale of a broken family torn apart by crime poverty booze and drugs the kind Jeremy Kyle would lap up like a three course meal. It is also essentially a tale of self destructive men three generations apart and each copying the other tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together despite not being strong enough. If you pick up a little of what it's about from the off-set you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn't disappoint in this. It's true what everyone said about the performances and the lead stars Winstone and Burke do deliver some great acting. We see Winstone lose it with his wife beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid. Likewise in a private moment we see Burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase the full impact of the night before kicking in. This is another of those films where there's no 'plot' to follow as such just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next. It's been acclaimed by many (including the Baftas!) but it really was just too grim and bleak for me. I have no right to criticize it for this knowing what I knew about it from the off-set but sadly this is how I found it. ** ",negative
" First of all: I love good Splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art but this zero-budget-flick is none of it! The picture-quality is so damned low the soundtrack the most annoying one I ever (!!!!)heard and as for the FX... well the super-low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie (what this junk here isn't). No concept a wafer-thin storyline primitive acting and rare dialog - I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie each one repeated about 20 times... same for a lot of film-sequences (may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made!!!) The story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring performing a show of self-mutilation. So far so good... But for these pseudo-art-idiot-directors this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense (freshly taken-out bowels are thrown on a naked bound woman in an earth-hole... why?? and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody movie )??? Disturbing? Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Necessary? No! Artistically? NO!!!!! Everyone mistaking this cheap gore-show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch Pink Floyd's The Wall to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way... I hope this was your first and last (!!!!!!!!) movie Andrew Cobb... !!!! And all you gore-heads out there remember: Not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically Art ... ",negative
" It was a good story but not very well told. I liked the themes and the main story line which wasn't as clear as it could have been. Maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in. The acting was okay to cheesy some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting. It took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it didn't keep my attention and the flow was just bad. I only just finished watching it and I'm glad I did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end. Again a good story but the delivery was sub par. Would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy and I do mean a little. ",negative
" It utterly defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist. It's hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience and then when you couldn't think of anything else to do layer another voice-over to the first voice-over which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? It was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the Stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. The bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. Copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic that Godard's one-time great friend Truffaut with Nuit Americain made the best film about film-making ever and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris! Incidentally Godard didn't choose the Stones' track of Sympathy With the Devil. It just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.

" This movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes as a family movie should and this wouldn't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn't be seeing. Not the best ABC Family film if you ask me. If there were less sexual themes in the movie then maybe it would be better. Hollywood isn't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations. There's really no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I wouldn't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do other than watch this movie please proceed to them. ",negative
" The producers made a big mistake casting Mark Lester who couldn't act or sing in the title role. Aside from his very bad acting all of Lester's singing had to be dubbed by a girl. I don't know why they cast him at all since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well. Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy who was only supposed to be 16. The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than Jack Wild ever was. It was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968. ",negative
" Stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham Michael Lerner Zane Busby and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted. Lame jokes abound and every punch line is well telegraphed. The dumb one liners come at a fast pace and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid this and seek out one of Lampoon's truly funny films like National Lampoon's Golddiggers - MERK ",negative
" The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: About halfway through F.Murray gets zapped because The Darkling is some kind of demon-like creature who enjoys living vicariously. He takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success. He feeds from their enjoyment of the Seven Deadly Sins. However part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil. Otherwise he cannot pervert their natural goodness. That's what the little guy said in his Barry White voice which I found both charming and amusing. Mostly amusing. Like imagine Barry White if he were a little dwarf and he was telling Aiden Gillen Dee Plane Dee Plane Bos Here eet come Dee Plane! All through the movie Dee Dwarf (actually a robotronic cherub) talks to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice saying things like It's OK to be bad you know you want it. Now you've committed murder you're really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for Being Evil Stores or something. It really is hilarious in a sick way. Anyhow Aiden Gillen is no F. Murray Abraham and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the axe (or knifed?). F. Murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film. He is a good actor. Aiden Gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face and he looks like maybe his remedial English Comp. class had never hit the Mythological Characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about. The ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comical. If this movie were a parody the ending was perfect. If it was not a parody then it was creepy; but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross-out that the movie itself could not deliver. The people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending. It just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending. ",negative
" I had some expectation for the movie since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic. When I saw the credits at the beginning I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way. Well the very first scene itself pis*ed me off. Then the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies. Well the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena who looked really hot in this one.And for that I give a rating of 2 out of 10. Guys please..please...don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie. Well you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes. Thats all. ",negative
" I don't think I'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: The Longest Day To Hell and Back Bridge on the River Kwai (all black and white) which all have good plots rich characters and great acting. I've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays. The plot however isn't a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's kind of like a traffic accident though I couldn't seem to turn it off! A movie doesn't need big money or great sets i.e. Twelve Angry Men and Lifeboat to be good... so budget is no excuse. What were they thinking? ",negative
" About the worst movie in distribution right now! I love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so I thought why not? Oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre! Whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school! There are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn't dignity. I know it what it takes to make films and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making Meat Market but none of that money and time went in to making it good. You need actors a script a real camera invest in some books on how to make independent films. I don't know how you got a DVD release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall. In gore films it is quality not quantity the effects are weak! I was so angry that this is actually in stores and that I couldn't get my money back. Please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock. I know I'm being very harsh I only had 10 lines so I'm trying to get to the point. ",negative
" The story is seen before but that does'n matter if you can figure out to make a proper storyboard. It is clear that the director haven't spent his work on the storyboard. Alongside this the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angles that do not match the message of the movie. The funniest is however if you take a look at the movie's website you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles. Because it remind us about hunting. But I have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles ;-) It will have 1 stars because the story is OK. It is a pity that Ti West has not spent more time to review his story. It is as if the movie was more important than the planning. Because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away... come. Everyone can make a movie but not all will be just as good. So a word of advice to Ti West are: stop and labeling what you want. Use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down on a storyboard. You certainly have the ability and desire - so don't abuse your talent. ",negative
" That's what the title should be anyway. This movie combines guns explosives and mindless killing to make one flop of an action movie. Let me make my point in a series of questions: answers type deal. What happens in the movie? People die. Is that it? Yes. What is the plot about? What plot? What is the point the movie is trying to make? Killing is the only solution. What are the characters like? Extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities. Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras in filming it. If you like constant killing and greed then watch the movie. If you happen to be repulsed by such low-standard entertainment then Made Men is not for you. To sum it up the plotline stinks the characters aren't worth their while the storyline is completely resistable and nothing fits together. This proves one thing: the actors directors and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren't Made . ",negative
" and it did. It is through my experience that when a horror film reaches franchise status and subsequent titles are released thereafter they all in turn become stricken by one inevitable factor: irrelevance. Omen IV: The Awakening makes no exception to this rule featuring another small child supposedly embracing their role as the Anti-Christ foretold by a religious prophecy. Haven't we seen this before? Wasn't it enough that over the span of three films prior to this release we've experienced the rise and fall of Damien Thorn? If you're a horror enthusiast such as myself you'll realize that it's common for a horror movie that has many sequels and prequels to its credit to fade away into redundancy - Children of the Corn Hellraiser Phantasm; the list goes on. At this point in the game I'm sure you know what to expect when you're prepared to view the fourth title in a series. Regardless there are times when you sit back and realize how shameless some filmmakers are. Omen IV: The Awakening is just that too - a shameless money making exercise. This film does not offer anything new or intriguing to the Omen lineup. As unique and genuine as Omen IV tries to be compared to its siblings the similarities and plot devices are embarrassingly alike. Elements like the guardian dog the involvement of a priest the skepticism of the people involved the decapitation death scene (clearly a homage to the original film when the journalist is beheaded by the sheet of glass)...even right down to the father's involvement in politics and prestige within the community make it too predictable. Although it is common to star a B-Rated cast into a horror title this far into a series the acting is off the charts chock-full of ridiculousness and unintentional humor due to some of the poorly delivered lines throughout this film. The atmosphere has completely vanished in comparison to the first three titles. In addition the epic score composed by Goldsmith in the previous movies has been replaced by an auditory debacle; an absolute joke and made me wonder if it was actually intended to be used for this film or just pulled from a bank of stock audio...which really says something because rarely do I comment on the lousy misuse of a musical score - until now. All in all I'd call Omen IV: The Awakening a failure. In the world of horror movies that carry a long list of titles behind them some manage to hit the mark and some don't. If you're interested in creating another notch on your weathered horror belt such as I am for completion purposes perhaps you could carve this title into it as well - if not for entertainment value then to appreciate when a film is executed properly or poorly.

" Les Visiteurs the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor but there was more. There were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain absurdness that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes. Now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling. The plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke Jean Reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been emptied so there's not a lot he can do to save the film. Now the duke's slave/helper he has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longer. If you liked Les Visiteurs do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you didn't like Les Visiteurs you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel... well I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies. ",negative
" I don't know why this has the fans it does and I don't know why I have even given it the score I have. This is preposterous. There are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen. But this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack even by Italian standards. Not a giallo this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in one his most blatant 'phoned in' performances. I reckon he turned up did a day's work and cleared off leaving Mr D'Amato to get others to fill in. Ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood! ",negative
" This movie is a bad to alright rip off of Friday the 13th. The movie is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp. He kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother (Another F13th take off). The intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victims. Then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son. Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute. He sets Bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on. This Movie is only recommended to those who enjoy B grade 80's Slashers. ",negative
" I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. It's not that bad for a made-for-TV horror movie but it is derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and businesslike for lack of a better word. It won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting but it's not a waste of time either. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard. However if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you won't be disappointed. The early scenes with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning. Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV.

" Please be warned: this movie though a pretty bad storyline was one of the most gruesome movies I have seen...EVER. Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie. So it officially begins with a party. Just your average party but there's some guy there. He's pretty into Kate...if you know what I'm saying. Memorise his face; it'll help later. So anyway Kate goes of to find George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. That's London underground at the middle of the night but she's just stupid like that. So the timetable says the next and last train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate dumb party girl that she is decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. Typically she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well almost... So the movie just carries on from there. Blood guts limbs even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body. In short it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick weird psycho. Or as the case may have it Creep. I'd say give it a go if you're into Saw Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre but for the rest of us Scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much. ",negative
" As with most of the reviewers I saw this on Starz! OnDemand. After watching the preview with my girlfriend she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched. I on the other hand thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching. I mean the design of Dr. Meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title. After watching it I can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it (namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story) it's best to pass over this one. *Major Spoilers Ahead* After making their first video for their as-yet-unfinished CD the lead singer Cassidy kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend Neil to notice her. 3 months later the band is trying to decide if they're going to finish the album or not. To try and see what Cassidy would have wanted they go to see an old psychic friend of hers Dr. Meso and try to contact her through him. In his card reading Dr. Meso turns up four straight Death cards for the four remaining band members. Bad times are ahead. (I just wanted to make a point that later in the film they do explain that the Death card really just represents change. Kudos to them on that at least.) Even without the approval of their deceased friend they decide to go ahead and finish the album. But while in the bathroom Cassidy's best-friend Dora catches a glimpse of her deceased friend. When another band-mate goes in to check on her Dora is standing in the dark requesting his sunglasses. That's when the killing begins. My main problem with the film from the very get-go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault. Too many warping effects unnecessary zooms and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film. An incoherent storyline doesn't help anything either. While the narrative hangs together for the first part once Cassidy is resurrected everything falls apart. We have jump-cuts between Cassidy and Dr. Meso (who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building) which show they are connected in some way or another. However within a few minutes of that revelation we find that Cassidy really is an independent being from Meso. She then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind Jack Nicholson as The Joker. But not in a good way. From this point on the whereabouts of Cassidy are shown but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence. One scene we see Cassidy standing at a desk when a character enters in the next she's nowhere to be found. As he moves behind the desk we see her at the end of a hallway. Then in another room grabbing the keys (which Neil already has) then back again. Not to mention that from one moment to the next Cassidy's mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it. One moment she wants to kill everyone (although she's only wounded 90% of the characters) - the next she's apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again. Sound confusing? That's because it is. It's a jumbled mess that I'm sure the writer couldn't even figure out. As for the performances most are particularly wooden. Some though are interesting but overall this isn't a piece that would be known for it's acting. The story is the driving force behind this piece. ",negative
" THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits (an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music) but sadly the movie is all downhill from there. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion... admonishing his servants and friends that the new Mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past. Well in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assures her that it's all merely in her mind and... well you can probably see where this all is going. You will have figured out what's going on long before our hapless heroine... because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and done better too). To add to the movie's myriad transgressions most cuts of this movie (on numerous cheap DVD compilations) seem to be missing a few key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walking towards the window... she goes to open it... you know she is going to see something scary... and then... suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband's arms. So what did she see??? I guess we'll never know. ",negative
" This documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence in which Brian Flemming perhaps purposely fails to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: His claims concerning the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ disregard key facts like: **The existence of some formulated creeds within Paul's letters. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. **The testimonies of the early Christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy. There were indeed many people claiming to be the Messiah during that period but only ONE of them has remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed Christ was the messiah and go on to die for those beliefs if they knew that he had not been resurrected. **Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. What I am saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian view. Don't be fooled by poor investigation. ",negative
" I viewed this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been affected but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the DVD. I will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was Claire Forlani. While fun to watch I feel she didn't live up to my expectations that I have so far found from her other films. I actually was equally pleased to see Arkin turn in a humorous performance. The other two actors I wasn't very familiar with so I can't compare their performance however they were fairly enjoyable also. The acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. The story line while some could say slightly compelling lacked direction. I feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. If you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then I recommend this film but otherwise leave it alone. ",negative
" Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear fantasizes about murdering his roommate tries to steal a magazine from a news stand and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station. And he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up (except for Krabbe in at least one scene too many) but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion. Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations overt symbolism and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas. ",negative
" 15 years ago Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations especially that of the youth. When I was a 3-year-old kid living in the Philippines I would watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 over there). When the movie came out in 1995 it was all shock and awe to me when I watched it with my dad and 2 uncles. My grandparents even sent me a Balikbayan box full of Power Rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build Megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the Rangers). I even played the video games and loved only one of them ( MMPR: Fighting Edition ) which was REALLY sad. Anyway it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series (especially anime mech series like Gundam ) Now that I'm 18 I'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now. To prove this I took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2-set DVD collection with MMPR: The Movie and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie and watched both of them. I was like Ugh. How awful. Just another junk in the attic for me. For all of you people of my generation this is NOT a show that you'd want to watch over and over again. I'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life but occasionally is not a bad thing now is it? Instead of Power Rangers I'd recommend something like Mobile Fighter G Gundam (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Ninja Senshi Tobikage (aka Ninja Robots) or even the ORIGINAL Sentai shows that were the basis of Power Rangers.

" This isn't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology or being dated issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with but rather a review on the story telling which most of us are truly interested in. The plot is about a combination of WWII Allied and German Navy members and two civilians (the hero and heroine) who are thrust together on a German U boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs. The manipulations aren't so bad by film standards and we know from the plot that realism isn't going to be high. What films like this need are credible and likable characters along with some semblance of reason in the actions. This film lacks both. For a full length film only 6 characters are given any time and 3 of them are barely looked into. McClure's hero is beyond routine and doesn't make much sense in any era. The female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered but the riddle is not much of a riddle and we could care less. A lot of failure in a film that should have been better even for its time. ",negative
" Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event even though he did save many other captive children. The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways bathrooms and even class rooms. In other words the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field. However the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it if you decided to View IT ! ",negative
" This is the last time I rent a video without checking in at the IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed such trash as Out of Sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film. There is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story filming and just plain common sense. This film does everything wrong. What were they thinking? ",negative
" There was not one single redeeming factor in this movie. The girlfriend and I both love action films. Especially fight scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer was awesome) but this movie was not entertaining. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and angry facial expressions. The main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously constipated at all times. The Army has disrupted his bowel movements on top of perfecting his fighting technique. The music isn't good either. They fight to the rap and hip-hop style of the streets 'cause these guys are thugs. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to low-budget dramas. Everything about this movie is classic B-style. The actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten Hollywood alleyway. The film is called Honor but there was no honor in making this film. It was simply a waste of money and spending wisely is something I consider to be honorable. Go see Felon instead. The fight scenes and situations are more real. ",negative
" i cannot believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was I wrong. The plot was abysmal the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful. Not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However i cannot lie some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the Asian boy says '' i lost my virginity to the babysitter so f**** stereotypes '' please do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh .. maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates ",negative
" Stalker is right! Girl sees guy girl wants guy girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him girl won't leave him alone girl pretends to be a patient girl can't stop talking about him girl pretends to love another guy (or two) he doesn't pay attention to her because she's annoying girl STILL won't leave him alone. Played right Drake's character could have been charming but she's completely wholly unrelenting in her pursuit of Cary Grant's character her girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull and sadly Drake's attempt at playing charmingly screwball comes off as disturbingly demented. Grant is himself as usual which is fine for Cary but it's as close to a phoned-in performance as I've ever seen from him. The direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim. Screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails like in this stubbed-out butt of an attempt it just stinks. Worse still Drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of Valium and a restraining order. She ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic. ",negative
" Without wishing to be a killjoy Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them and Camp Blood being another. The acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself . Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for £1 but remember you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price. ",negative
" warning:It contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). This one confirms the above lemma. The second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action. The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. Even more other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. And this made more frustrated. To compensate the consequent lack of suspense we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters. And oh yes they have lots to show. Andy (P.Hoffman) for example is a drug addict more? he is cheating his wife more? he plans to rob his father more? his wife is cheating with his brother more? he doesn't regret his complicity to his mother's death more? he is a serial killer more? etc etc it's not enough space to write here... I wonder how could he have a top job. And why his wife didn't leave him before. On the other hand I enjoy much the performances of the actor Hoffman. Even here PSH saves what is left from my 7$ spent for this absurdity. Why absurdity? Because it doesn't have sense why should I care for the despicable characters? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic( at least pleasant) character. Also it's a lot of sentimentality for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents'lives before the crime. ",negative
" Too bad I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director failed to put this together. There's a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off hokey. The director didn't do his job. Promising action comes off lame. So much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of The Rage (DirecTV credits it as 1996) simply isn't worth the time to watch it. Another director would have done a better job. ",negative
" What the ........... is this ? This must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever. I know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high but this is too stupid to be true. I baught this film for 0.89$ and I still feel the urge to go claim my money back. Can you imagine who hard it STINKS ? Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations??? Well actually you couldn't possible care less. And why should you? The makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care. They didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension. The director ( Stephen Carpenter -- I guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the Kindred (1986) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did Soul Survivors. Complete crap as well but at least that one had Eliza Dushku. This junk has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! ( Who ?? ) Yeah that's right the Melrose Place chick. Her very memorable character dies about 15 min. after the opening credits. She's the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? The rest of the actors...they don't deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting. You're hoping they die a quick and painful death...and not only their characters My humble opinion = 0 / 10 ",negative
" The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army including the Legion marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into horizon blue and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right. ",negative
" Sadly the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at Universal Studios last week so we were stuck with video. That could even be a metaphor for this second-rate King Kong movie from Toho studios' stalwart director Ishiro Honda. Essentially it's a warm up for King Kong versus Godzilla . It even uses the idea of a Mecha-Kong like Mecha-Godzilla. Of course the movie climaxes with King Kong fighting Mecha-Kong on top of the expo tower in Tokyo but if you didn't know that already then maybe you're in the age group that this movie was intended for. The cast is headed by a guy named Rhodes Reason who we had never heard of... glancing over his list I see mostly a lot of scattered American TV credits so it's interesting that they dragged him all the way to Japan so that they could have a nominal American hero. The real hero of the movie is the more sensitive Japanese commander played by Akira Takarada who I recognized from Hiroshi Inagaki's iconic version of Chushingura (47 Ronin) and also from the original Godzilla films by Honda. I'm sorry Rhodes Reason whoever you are but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde played by Linda Miller. We laughed at the way Reason would always find a way to interject himself between Miller and Takarada who it seemed like she kind of preferred. Of course like all Kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the King himself. She discovers a nice trick: if you talk to a giant ape really..... really.... slowly..... he'll understand what you're saying. And if you're a blonde gal that means that he'll do whatever you tell him to do. That fact is not lost on Dr. Who (Eisei Amamoto) and Madame Piranha (Mie Hama) -- representing a nation which shall not be named -- who plan on using her as bait to get Kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the North Pole. Yes this is truly the plot of the whole movie -- apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons. Dr. Who builds Mecha-Kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way so they decide to go for the real Kong. Kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with Mecha-Kong a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasn't followed up on. By the end of the movie the cute blonde has shouted Kong or King Kong in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they're speaking for all of us. Basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the Kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early just like the newest version of the story. Kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously. It's a nice looking movie I'm sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways. The monsters don't ever really scare in these films they just jump around and push each other around a lot. It's not a worthless movie but it's extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy. ",negative
" Nacho Libre (2006) Directed By: Jared Hess Starring: Jack Black Ana de la Reguera Héctor Jiménez & Darius Rose MPAA Rating: PG-13 (for some rough action and crude humor including dialog) Say what you will about it (I know some people who despise it to no end) but I have always thought that Napoleon Dynamite was a funny movie--not the brightest brick on the wall but a funny movie nonetheless. Jack Black is also a very funny man--irritating at times yes and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him but funny. There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree. So I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess the writer and director of Napoleon Dynamite and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie. This plot had it been done as a skit on some such show as Saturday Night Live or possibly even Mad TV would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat. Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. Feeling shunned by the entire monastery Nacho (Black) now the monastery's cook decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances hit an all-time low Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with School of Rock after all. Well to my displeasure this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie. It is again Hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course for all I know maybe that is the general thought of teenagers as many seemed to enjoy this movie. Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie. A seven-year-old could make up the same joke. The performances in Nacho Libre are actually good. Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic worthless lines in ever put on paper comical. Unfortunately this movie just wasn't enough for him. It didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before but now I can say that not only is she quite talented but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight. She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well. Héctor Jiménez who plays Nacho's bumbling partner Esqueleto kept me laughing continuously. He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black's. Darius Rose who plays an orphan named Chancho didn't have many lines but what can I say I just enjoyed him. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did their job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie. Nacho Libre just does not work. Its plot is stretched far too thin. The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work. I very rarely laughed and if I did it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast. And that leads me to the bright side of Nacho Libre : yes the cast. This cast was justwell for lack of a better word they were on. They all clicked had excellent chemistry together and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hess's Napoleon Dynamite kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie I was surprised to find myself so often bored with Nacho Libre . Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was. All I know is that Nacho Libre is not a good movie and yet because of its cast it is completely worthless. There is a small reason to watch if only to watch Jack Black work. But if you are not a fan of Jack Black then avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black but I am done with this movie and with this review. Final Thought: Yikes! This is Jared Hess's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical Napoleon Dynamite . Overall Rating: 4/10 (C+) ",negative
" Man To Man tries hard to be a good movie: it has its heart at the right place it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate. But there lies also some of the problems of this picture. It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. So it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - Man To Man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to look concerned genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer. Add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it: it is entertaining has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch) but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied. It tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious) and succeeds most of the time. ",negative
" After seeing this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound-track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty. For at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20's music and the scratchiness of the sound-track. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it was the Director. I was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film. The music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. These days directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same. So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) the sound-track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss. You will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound-track and certainly not a cat's meow. ",negative
" I have to say I was very curious on viewing this film and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th Century Fox in 1970. It has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films and this only deepened an interest as I just had to see what made this movie so bad.Upon seeing it I think I have my answers. Although I will say it does make for curious viewing the acting direction and script are so laughingly bad that the supposed satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to try to carry the film but after the opening sequence of the sex-change operation the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help as he licks and leers at the screen he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he's doing there. Rex Reed bounces around as Myron Myra's alter ego and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in this role. But of course arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west. The sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film. I don't mean to put this cast down personally; but in this film no one comes out looking good. The direction seems so unassured and non-existent that the film is not only bad but boring as well. Throw in some old film footage of old stars and the movie becomes even more disconnected. To each his own to anyone that enjoyed this and I was glad I at least saw it but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the beginning. ",negative
" Okay... it seems like so far only the Barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint. Beware this writeup is *LONG*. For those not in the knowing (mostly the non-Belgians) : Tom Barman director of this film is the frontman of dEUS one of the better known rock bands of the late 90's here in Belgium. Basically they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale. Then egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart with Barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the dEUS-monicker. The way it always happens in such cases the post-breakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original. They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album The Ideal Crash in 1999 presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting. They didn't quite make it. However egos were still pretty big it seems : big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies. More often than not this sort of thing is a VERY big mistake and this film does not make the exception. And Barman clearly went for *art* on this one another very big mistake. For one thing he's a musician not a movie director. For another dEUS at it's best made fun and provoking music but never anything close to what I would consider *art*. It shows. So what's this movie about? Basically it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in Antwerp as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting. The characters are shallow the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole film made me smile (slightly) about 3 times and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh (not quite loud). Mood? The film just doesn't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all. Mystery? Well (*MINOR SPOILER*)the idea of the wind-man inspiring the name of the film is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very and has been done a thousand times before (anyone remember Johny Destiny - one of Tarantino's worst appearances on film to date)(*END MINOR SPOILER*). And well its *artistic* so don't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous. In other words except for the few smiles it bored me out of my shorts. So what remains? Well the soundtrack is pretty good though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST's have shown lately : first it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the CD. Second it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs which simply doesn't work. In the end it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs. And sadly it's Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I'm concerned. All in all it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies. Camera work is okay as well though not anything that would make you scream out with joy. The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor. Since I originate from Antwerp it was fun to play a kind of guess-the-location game. I would hardly consider this as a quality though. All in all another chance lost for Flemmish film. I keep on noticing that lately the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country. This is mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional (the brothers Daerden come to mind). Maybe the Flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too. ",negative
" The female lead was a terrible actress which made the whole movie mediocre. She was smiling too much when she first went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should have made the police suspect her. I would have been inconsolable in the identical situation. She seemed way calm for a mother who could not find her daughter. It was as if she did not want to even be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the part better. And it would have made a lot more money for such a controversial important subject. Everyone else was excellent. I don't know where the lead actress is but I hope she got some acting lessons. ",negative
" You gotta love the cheesy low budget movies. This one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting (really bad). Plus every time I see Mercedes McNab (the sister) I keep thinking 'Watch out! She's a vamp! - for those that know Buffy/Angel. A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course. I don't know if I feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any money. I'd say it's good for little kids in it's simplicity but I don't know if I'd want to subject a kid to it... umm...1/10 because that's the lowest it will go. ",negative
" Despite being released on DVD by Blue Underground some five years ago I have never come across this Italian sword and sorcery item on late-night Italian TV and now that I have seen it for myself I know exactly why. Not because of its director's typical predilection for extreme gore (of which there is some examples to be sure) or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time (it is set in the Dark Ages after all)it is quite simply very poor stuff indeed. In fact I would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that I have yet seen and believe me I have seen plenty (especially in the last few years i.e. following my excursion to the 2004 Venice Film Festival)! Reading about how the film's failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director's subsequent (and regrettable) career nosedive into mindless low-budget gore I can see their point: I may prefer Fulci's earlier giallo period (1968-77) to his more popular stuff horror (1979-82) myself but even on the latter his commitment was arguably unquestionable. On the other hand CONQUEST seems not to have inspired Fulci in the least  seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist sprinkle it with incongruent characters (cannibals vs. werewolves anyone?) irrelevant gore (we are treated to a gratuitous nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh-eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists!) and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked brain-slurping villainess (don't ask) and her slimy reptilian pet!! For what it is worth we have two heroes for the price of one here: a young magic bow-carrying boy on some manhood-affirming odyssey (Andrea Occhipinti) and his rambling muscle-bound companion (Jorge Rivero i.e. Frenchy from Howard Hawks' RIO LOBO [1970]!) who despite being called Mace (short for Maciste perhaps?) seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger protégé out of trouble (particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the 'boils'). Unfortunately even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti's electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times. Fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness (after defeating one and all with the aid of the all-important magic bowso much for his own supposed physical strength!) onto his next  and thankfully unfilmed  adventure!

" Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society in a life without meaning purpose or direction. I watched this because of all the stellar reviews but I'm afraid I must have missed something. The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. She's not interesting or exciting. She's just useless. I've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing. They are just lazy bums. I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch. Sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her. Lots of junkies winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I wouldn't want to see a film about them either. Possibly there is something there that I totally missed. Otherwise I'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a French female director is high art. ",negative
" This film turned up on local TV here in South Africa recently and I thought that I'd warn even those who enjoy watching B grade bad movies (which I do)that this is not even amusing. The plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the film obviously shot in the early seventies consists of extreme wide shots of people walking in real time and awfully slowly from A to B. This makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens. I am really curious - how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end?

" I've seen this movie today for the first time and I never heard of it before probably because of it's poor message. First of all the directing itself is quite good the actors played well and the CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) is magnificent. But that alone doesn't make a movie. No story at all no message behind beautiful exploited talents. Or do I have to make people remember the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story. And this is what's missing the whole 7 minutes. There for a simple 4 rating. ",negative
" I'm not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie but few minutes after it started I wanted to leave the theater. For a while I hoped at least the story will surprise me but then realized it's a waste of time there was just nothing there. I stayed only because I had another show after it. Design: some designs where quite beautiful mostly of the environment but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design. They look great while still - on posters and screenshots but not when they have to come to life! They just didn't work mostly because the very same mistake most 3D companies make: technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in 3D that would make you feel that the character is alive. You need a lot of effort and knowledge (hence money) to create something that really feels like hair skin fabric etc. Those characters in the movie were made out of cloth and that just didn't work! So they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic. It just didn't have the feel of a material that dolls are made of (that's what those characters meant to be). I think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters. It just had a feeling of a 3D shoot'n'run computer game. I don't want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen don't know about you... Animation was also a disgrace. I am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in 9 . It was stiff boring almost lacked any imagination or mood. It was just a little bit above most average 3D animations I saw and that doesn't add to it any good... And all that - the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story right?! That was not the case here. Actually the story was the worst thing in that movie. It was below any level. It starts straight forward it goes straight forward and it ends the same. There is no twist no surprise no good dialogs even no development. We've heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and 9 is just one of them and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie. The characters don't even have time to get into the story - they are just there showing themselves almost immediately and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know what's going on. It just didn't work. There are also many repetitive action sequences that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story... Acting sound and script - oh my gosh what can I tell it was pathetic. Bad story has a bad script and except dialogs like No don't do it! I will do it! But... you cannot do it alone! We can do it together! But there are rules! But we have to save him! etc etc and so on and repeating itself all the time so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs there were those non stop Ahh and Ohhh and Ehh and Oooh and Whatchout and Run! and OhOhh! that were following almost every jump run or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsed. Conclusion: bad acting bad animation bad sound bad story bad script bad characters everything expected no surprises no twist nothing. Only some good designs are not worth the time. BIG NO! ",negative
" Demi Moore's character in the movie was selected for the SEALs because of her looks. That was a bad start and the movie went down from there. The plot was totally unbelievable. The will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough. This movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required. Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. The differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting. ",negative
" I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest/worst attempts at one. A lot of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre. Usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre but the challenge generally resides in making it original new and inventive. This movie fails to do so. There is no sense of who the characters really are apart from Sylvie Moreau's (who is the real star of this movie not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative. The pacing of the movie can become annoying rhythm lacks and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally or rather making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious. Of course along with that you have the right-on-cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched. I can't believe that a movie who makes obvious Woody Allen allusions ends up being this deceptive. If you expect a good light-hearted romantic comedy this is not it. Or rather this a poor attempt at it. You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior Quebecois directors making better flicks. Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur's. ",negative
" JUST CAUSE showcases Sean Connery as a Harvard law prof Kate Capshaw (does she still get work?) as his wife (slight age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern cop (!) and Ed Harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer. Weird casting but the movie plays serious mindf** with the audience. (don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers) First of all I felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the Liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence. The coroner witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. Connery is a Harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty. He is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial. Connery is stonewalled (yawn...) by the small town officials and the good IL' boys club but finds that the case against Blair the alleged killer now on death row was all fabricated. The main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him. The beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even played Russian roulette to get the confession out of him. Connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris he finds out where Harris hid the murder weapon. He gets a re-trial and Blair is freed. I think... film over.... Then suddenly! It turns out that Blair IS a psychotic psycho and that he used white guilt to enlist Connery. He concocted the story with Ed Harris in return for Blair carrying out a few murders for Harris. now Blair is on the loose again thanks to Connery's deluded PC principles! The final 30 min. are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama Connery and Fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts (yes you read that right) in the everglades. That was one weird film. So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient the cops are all just bullies and Abu Graib type torturers but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry. Truly depressing on every level! The system is completely rotten and the PC white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too. Two thumbs down. Connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something. ",negative
" A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background contained the comment A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's . This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South America's War of the Triple Alliance (1865) Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia. No society however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier. G.I. Jane is Hollywood fluff.

" TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert. One of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? If this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness. If its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons.You will laugh long and hard AT this film probably more than many other Hollywood comedies . ",negative
" This Italian semi-horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes. The only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film. The story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon go berserk and seemingly kill them. They show the nudity but they never really show the murders at this point in the film. Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her. He has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business. After a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes foxes and such. At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely. This movie just did not work for me it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where Evelyn did rise from the grave. Granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave just not under her own power. The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too. I just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull.

" Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it you're a better person than me! This movie while a great attempt at 'imitating' Laurel and Hardy through appearance sound and routine falls very short of honoring them or even being a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue is torn from old L+H movies and planted in unrealistically the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) musical number? Editing is choppy acting is stiff lines are horrid physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap sets?) and overall it's a terrible thing to witness. It's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can and learn how things WERE. You know what a MAGNATE is don't you? Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence. I pity anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update/honor of the boys. Where was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG?!? Why ruin 'Here's another fine mess'? Why skip 'any the wiser'? Why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars?! WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ???? WHY MUST LARRY HARMON BE IN IT? WHY BOZO!? And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing? I mean really. Fart jokes for God's sake. FART JOKES. ",negative
" I couldn't make sense of this film much of the time and neither could anyone else based on other reviews. The opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story. In it a photojournalist with a big mustache cancels his vacation to get away from his girlfriend. He is assigned to photograph a mountain range. It's rumored to be haunted but I couldn't tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film. On his way he meets a beautiful writer (Patty Shepard) and convinces her to join him on his working trip. Throughout the film there is this terrible music score mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream SHUT UP ALREADY!!! What really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it's about to become good though it never does. There is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere. The inn and the silent abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous. The foggy nights look real not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set. And the idea while not original had potential. But it never does improve at least not enough to be worthwhile. Here's how it goes more or less. They stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper (you expect him to be named Igor) with a hearing problem. There is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window but the scene is so dark I had no idea what was going on. Whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me. In any event we never find out know what happened. There is a scene where she wanders off during the night. Whether she is sleepwalking or mesmerized by the witches of the title is never explained. Another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen then found again with nothing stolen. They wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman. There are other things including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way (will they kill her or brainwash her into joining them?) the witches themselves a bunch of brunette women in white robes who don't show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained. Even the closing scene doesn't make any sense. When all is said and done most people will be saying Huh?  ",negative
" Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell New Mexico suck. Take Alien mixed with The Thing mixed with Contact mixed with of all things On the Beach The Andromeda Strain the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot. Derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie. Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (James Spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join him. he turns her down. AGGH!) In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. I mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke. With about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif. (Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logan's Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them. That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it. Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie. ",negative
" Oscar Wilde's comedy of manners perhaps the wittiest play ever written is all but wrecked at the hands of a second-rate cast. Sanders is as one would expect casually indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy; indeed the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy -- doubtless the Hays office insisted. Preminger's direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal. Stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words. But skip this version. ",negative
" I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews but I guess the critics were just sucking up to Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It is definitely the slowest movie I have ever seen with numerous pointless ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Besides Defoe who was decent the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie Defoe's wife Giada included was ridiculously awful (how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me). This movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie. Sorry for being so harsh but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers' time. ",negative

" Man would expect that a movie shot with an approx. budget of 300 000 000 U$D should at least entertain you for the time you are spending in the cinema actally watching it. Matrix Reloaded proves this assumption wrong. The Matrix worked out better despite having apparent holes concerning logic of the story. At least nobody could explain to me why beating up a bot (aka agent) inside a simulation (aka martix) would harm the responsible computer program in any way... Unfortunately the Wachowski brothers made excactly this agent-bashing the main thing in Matrix Reloaded : it's a beat 'em up o-rama. This fighting scenes may be work out sufficient (or even cool) in a 5 sec. trailer but prolonged for several minutes apparently being faked choreographed poorly and repeated over and over again it is nothing more than boring. Despite seeing the promised spectecular stunts there is nothing more than simple low-quality unimaginative bashing already seen (or better not) in eg. Van Damme 'movies'. The difference of post-production (etherything is 5 times faster the camera floats around a lot and freezes on certain scenes and this is repeated for at least 5min) doesn't help here all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of martial arts . Beside these 'fights' all actors do refuse to do what they are payed for: acting. What's up besides the fighting scenes? Few except Hollywood routine. This oh-so-multicultural bunch of hippies which sucked in Waterworld are recycled as citizen of Zion (mans last city on earth) and on the order of Morpheus they start dancing 'cause this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and butts. The oh-so-popular clichée of the frog aka frenchmen talking with this je ne sais quoi dumb accent who wastes his fortune because of a liason d'amour is bravely served. Following this (and unwanted funny) is the fight between Neo and the sinister followers of 'the frog' since it takes place in an Erroy Flynn like enterieur luckily featuring a lot of mideaval weapons for decoration. For Neo posing with the hellebarde just add 2 stairs and a lot of statues (for being destructed thrown over evil guys and the like) and you get 5 more senseless boring min. of this junk.

" This is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't care what the critics say it's bad. I think the problem is with Kundera's novel. It's not that it's unfilmable; it's just that like 99% of his work it's pretentious and overdrawn. He seems to be enamored with himself his characters come off as navel-gazing and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. I have read many of his works (even his Socialist Realist poetry. That was truly awful) -- I just don't understand what the fuss is about. Characteristics (like the self-absorption) in his novels make for infuriating reading. In a movie all the things that I dislike about Kundera were magnified. Maybe I just missed something but I don't think so. On a side note I cannot believe that this is a Criterion Collection DVD. No way is this movie THAT essential. ",negative

" The plot of this film is not strong at all lots of holes. If you approach it as a car movie its not bad lots of great cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I am from the area where this was filmed. I get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89. Its an interesting historical piece for us locals. Seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on VHS. Had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay I find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town. I didn't know the director was from St.Cloud. ",negative
" I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Candians but i found this show to be not funny at all. The producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it's getting talked about! I was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true. But there really wasn't anything funny about these stereotypical characters. The fresh of the boat dad who doesn't understand his daughter. The radical feminist Muslim daughter (who by the way is a terrible actress) and the young modern Indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can (he's a pretty good actor i only see him getting better). it is very contrived and the dialog doesn't flow that well. there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and don't really care to watch another episode. I did however enjoy watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again she's always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesn't have the same acting abilities!

" I have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie. I guess I must have missed something. The beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories. That's the best part. After the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads. That's when boredom sets in. Certainly the thread with the Felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity. Unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular. Bottom line: a two-hour plot-thin listlessness.

While they wait for him to recover all sorts of mysterious goings-on happen including a couple of murders. A creepy film; worth seeing! ",negative
" I picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales. Well for the previous it is better than daytime television....though I'm not sure how much. It does have its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for TV movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together. In short a terrible Sci Fi channel type movie. It has its points such as the future is dirty like Blade Runner showed ..... of course this is no Blade Runner . The Captain looks sort of feels like actor Robert Forster the kind of person one might want to be around. But unfortunately it rather ends up feeling like a bad Andromeda rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of Aliens the mystic is vampire Willow sexually intensified and the new Captain might as well be like Jan-Michael Vincent running around on Danger Island in the Banana Splits ; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets; he's got very little right to it. All of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the 'Eureka Maru' as they are fighting a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities.......just like the Nietzcheans in Andromeda . It might have a redeeming feature with Michael Ironside but after a while one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot! He probably had fun doing it but it doesn't help the movie much. It's ..... okay . Okay in the way that one might watch the DVD once without turning it off; if they watch it with commercials they will probably change the channel. One might watch it once .......... but a few hours later be wondering what it was that made them watch it all. For me that was the femme fatale ............. when she was fighting. ",negative
" I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this God that and Christ is our saviour stuff. The movie and the story line did not need it. If as I am you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been. ",negative
" Where to begin there's so much wrong and horrible about this movie I am not sure where to start. Okay the two stooges who wrote this crapper. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton first they couldn't make up their so-called minds for a name. My guess they split the difference that's why the main title is BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE but the end screen says HEAD THAT WOULDN'T DIE. Neither one knows anything about the Medical profession. After all Doctors take oaths to do no harm . Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered harm . Plus a little thing called blood and tissue matching. Rejection would spell death for Jan in the pan. Plus who keeps a patch work monster. What medical school did Bill graduate from FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name that bugs the hell out of me. Plus the brilliant surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner doesn't know how to keep a patient sedated? All and all a disaster of a movie it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable except on MST3K. I give it THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY. ",negative
" I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well I found it strange and completely pointless... so I decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it. Wow. what a difference. The original one was way better. I'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement it's existence did have a purpose. It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I don't want to go into details just simply put if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it SHOULD look like feel free to watch the 70s version a little dated but A lot better.

" This is a badly made poor remake of Bimalda's classic Parineeta. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. Well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity. The acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham. Shekar's father's choice of words in abusing Lolita ( Balan ) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again the scene where Shekhar ( Saif ) slaps Lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters is quite jarring to the senses and could have been easily avoided. Similarly the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it's spirit the work falls apart. The song piyu bole is quite OK. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where Saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. On these counts this movie deserves 3 stars. The song and dance by Rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on. The song is tuneful but I remember having heard it somewhere before and if Iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized. Well agreed the times have changed from then to now. But then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times. This is what happens when the modern Bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the NRIs and grabbing the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such movies end up neither belonging to India nor to any other part of the world. ",negative
" There was nothing of value in the original movie this one was even lamer. The fact that I even found it to rent was absolutely amazing. Anyone connected to this film has to be high on something! So what was the story line? What was with the girl? Was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film. Sadly I tried several times to watch this. I even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback. Kid said it was stupid and he was four years old. I find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a B film. That might be pushing it. I did love the theme song. Good thing it was only a dollar it was worth it. I suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be. Is pot legal in France? ",negative
" (48 out of 278 people found this comment useful and counting...) People are such suckers for image and looks - as much as for the intellectually hollow idealism that lurks behind Communism. Che's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by Leftist propaganda (such as this movie) about him. I don't know what's worse: being captured by one of Che's murder-squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically Soderberghian garbage. The question isn't why this pet-project was made but what took them so long. By them I'm referring of course to Left-wing Hollywood and its secret love of Marxist tyrants (Lenin Castro... take your pick). I am fascinated that it took decades for one of Tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand even? It's a mystery. All these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically one-sided projects yet somehow Che Guevara who is arguably the most popular and well-known Communist hasn't been a film topic of theirs yet. Guerrilla has all the hallmarks of an American truth-bending story of an epic scale; there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar Hollywood big-budget political fairy-tale bios such as Malcolm X or Gandhi i.e. almost none. The movie stars Del Toro as the famous Argentinian revolutionary. Nevertheless however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why Del Toro fits the bill only visually. Del Toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble Guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes Guevara come off as too primitive. Casting such mediocrities as Bratt Philips and Franka Incompetente only underlines the director's lack of sound judgment. The movie is to the most part extremely slow (no surprise there) and visually uninteresting. Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour mark so it's quite telling that this Soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that His Oceanic Grandness was up to the task. If you think the film's length indicates that a bulk of Che's life has been shown here - then think again. Soderbergh focuses on Che's last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of Guevara's alleged idealism. (Psychopaths don't have ideals.) I do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of Che's earlier life. Did he actually consider it too uninteresting? A massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer huh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this over-praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4-hour movie. Soderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative dark side - which is more than 90% - of Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth (God forbid he should taint the holy image of Che) Soderbergh proves himself not a humanist - a fake image which most Hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold - but the opposite: that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested (like on guinea pigs). Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind; such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat (what a stupid term) they're supposedly siding with. Half of all students around the world wear Che's image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why. He has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this man's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting. In reality wearing a Che shirt only underlines one's overall shallowness and total disinterest in self-education. (Wouldn't YOU want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his/her face to the world?) Wearing Che's by-now cliché image has become as common as having a Bart Simpson coffee cup. All those Che-wearers probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they'll ever read up on about Fidel Castro's dead ally. After everything that'd been done in the name of Marx one would think that these mongrel ideals would be finally laid to rest. It seems mankind will never learn. Stalin Mao Kim Il Pol Pot Castro Milosevic Ceausescu the Iron Curtain a hundred million dead more than a billion ruined physically and/or mentally through this system... so none of that matters huh? The fact that Del Toro won a Cannes Award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote.

" My goodness is this movie bad. I was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage. Yeah yeah good guys wear white bad guys wear black....and the good guys always win. Now go home and hug your kids and feel how good Hollywood has made you feel. Blech! I can't believe this brain dead movie was made by Wes Craven. I'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage so he made this piece of dung. It is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director. Ya see a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle IL' bad thing or he's gonna hurt her daddy. But being Ms. All-American girl next door we know she's gonna save the day and beat the bad guys...the end. Girl power ROCKS. C'mon now only an idiot would find this entertaining... a roller coaster ride let alone something fresh or new. All those super-duper reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick paying back a favor or they have sold their souls to the devil. Rachael McAdams is beautiful....yup that's it. Not a good performance not a horrible one...she's just cute. She would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie. She isn't tough enough to be a good female action lead. Cillian Murphy was at least passable in 28 Days. But here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one. He gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5'5'' McAdams because after all she was a cheerleader...and a field hockey player...and I'm sure she owns all the Tae Bo tapes...so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire. I wouldn't trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11. Ya see this movie was done before except before they did it well. Go re-rent any of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger international terrorists except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are WAY more competent and interesting. I simply don't understand how Hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy. No wonder movie revenues are down. Throw your $6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life you'll never get back. ciao FreddyShoop ",negative
" You know I went to see The Hills have eyes 2 wanting to like it. I really enjoyed the original and the remake was fairly entertaining. They obviously had more money to throw around than Wes Craven did on special effects the second time around. Even though I still prefer the original film the remake was done well and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody intense and great special effects. In short a great popcorn movie for any horror fan. Which brings us to The Hills have eyes 2 . Man where do I start? The plot or lack of one is paper thin. We are not exactly breaking new ground here.The military has decided to monitor the area and all of these people turn up missing. So what do we do now? Let's send in the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever seen. Gee I've never seen that premise before. To make a long story short you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion. Once again the special effects by Nicotero are great but the kills no matter how graphic become boring and predictable. Honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck. It was bloody and graphic but I found it predictable boring and not scary at all. For me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought.Wes Craven and his son shared the writing duties and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films but sadly this isn't one of them.

" AKA: Mondays In The Sun I have no idea what I just watched. Three men wander aimlessly and drink grousing about everything and at everyone in their path. This is supposed to be a drama but what it is is a total waste of film without a single redeeming quality. I have read reviews touting the performances herein as wonderful beautiful and heroic. I'm afraid I cannot agree unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto-humans who ever walked. All in all? This was not a movie. It wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience. I've watched this three times and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage. There is nothing profound here whatsoever.

" The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most awful amateurish film I've ever seen - ranking right up there with Manos the Hands of Fate in terms of poor acting useless direction and kindergarten-level production values. In this movie a silly-looking claymation/stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum CA and begins dining on the local hayseeds. In the thrilling climax the creature described by one local as a giant alligator with flippers drags it's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would-be lunch before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times & it dies from boredom. Every character in this moovie is a complete moron. One pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a $4.75 pint of Ripple; instead of simply buying the bottle the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander shoots at a cop gets chased towards the lake all so that he can eaten by the monster. Unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam. There's a fake magician struggling with a phony British accent (to make him seem more legit) two overly-bumbling redneck boat renters some cheesy pre-historic cave art done in crayon and annoying banjo-pickin' background moosic. In one painful scene the fake magician and his dopey wife/girlfriend/accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky even though it is clearly day time still. Even on constant fast-forward this moovie hurts and hurts bad. MooCow says call the fumigators 'cause this cow pie really stinks! :=8P ",negative
" This has to be one of the top overrated anime shows ever made. And yes I was even shown the End of Evangelion and that still made me hate it even more. Not to mention the countless rip-offs of this show! I don't mind psychological and philosophy untertones but Evangelion drags it out into the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones that seemed to be interesting were Asuka Misato and Pen-Pen. Other than that mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers. They need to go to a psyciatric center not piloting giant robots against aliens called Angels . Even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all. Goes something like this: Well there are these robots and they are really cool because they bleed(!) when they get hurt but they are not really mecha but captured angels so sometimes they go insane and don't do what the underaged pilots want and they have to be controlled better...blah blah blah! I am so sorry but I just cannot recommend Evangelion to anyone anime otakus or not. To those who love this series greatly fine you're entitled to that opinion I respect you. But to thoses that have a out of your mind obsession to think that every one will like this series you are more of an egotist. I prefer Macross Mospeada Run-Dim and Robot Taekwon V myself. ",negative
" My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you have seen the BBC's Planet Earth which I am sure most of you have then you are not gonna like this movie too much. And I own all the discs of Planet Earth I had seen the rating for this movie very high and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. Alas I went to the theater and the movie started I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear I recognized them from my DVDs at home of Planet Earth . The movie continued and went on and on and on me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from Planet Earth . We were very very disappointed as I think 90% of the footage is from Planet Earth . I am saying 90% because some of the scenes I didn't recognize. I have a feeling that I simply didn't remember them. So finally what this movie really is is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of Planet Earth with a narration aimed at kids. Yes the narration is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub the narrator says The polar cubs are not like human kids. They don't always listen to their mothers ( I don't remember the exact words but this is how it is ) So in a nutshell. This is condensed Planet Earth for kids ! ",negative
" In addition to his Tarzan series the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs did write many other books although aside from the popular At the Earth's Core few of these have been filmed. One exception is the novel entitled The Lad and the Lion brought to the screen as The Lion Man (1936) an over-talkative static old-hat slow-moving and rather dull movie despite being filmed on real desert locations. Actually movie is the wrong word. The narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks. For instance at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear. Even more frustrating for the keen movie fan are the characters who make an impression of sorts (like the lass who plies Hall with drugged wine) but are enacted by players who are not credited! The credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns. One exception is Australian actress Finis Barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young Master Fairy. Admittedly most of the cast are saddled with atrocious King James dialogue which has to be heard to be believed! But the way to play this rubbish is tongue-in-cheek a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the film's roster of no-talent players. Maybe director J.P. McCarthy scotched that idea. Anyway it's sad to see the lovely Kathleen Burke forced to trade lines with the likes of Richard Carlyle (her dad) and Jon Hall (her suitor). Admittedly Mr Hall delivers his lines with marginally more conviction than Mr Carlyle but that is no recommendation. ",negative
" I had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school. As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new. Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through. It had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original. We have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone. Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does. On to the story like I said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling. Everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid. Perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved I've seriously gotten more emotion out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the Leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted. So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie I've seen was Juno. So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message. Like I said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity. I really hope someone decides to either re-make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential. ",negative
" This film was abysmal. and not in the good way as some have claimed. First off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF is going on with this van love. The plot basically is: boy wants sex so buys a van (which in fairness is quite cool). Unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks! And he fails with some. Then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get. Then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend. And he tips his van. At which point danny devito saves the day. Although he didn't need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first. I gave this 2 *'s as i'm willing to assume that there's some sort of 70's Vanning subculture i'm not getting and also because there's some 70's boobage too. ",negative

Ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I am tired of Hollywood making it seem like it was. This is not the worst of the films concerning Vietnam that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case John Rambo carrying around a 50 cal Machine Gun taking on what seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a good many Russians is an insult to watch.

" Nahhh! Leila (Grace Mills) is a teenager turned on to Satan (and LSD) by her archaeologist fiancé Richard. There's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle where Leila and Richard drink blood drop drugs join in sex orgies dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants masks and capes and the women don't wear anything at all. Unfortunately these kind of extracurricular activities have left Leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded spirit of evil. Leila also comes from a screwed up family which doesn't help either. Her older brother John is a recluse who seems to be in love with her. Her mother Patricia (Maria Perschy) is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father's death. To top it off her sister (Maria Kosti) is a slutty semi pro golfer named (gasp!) Debbie Gibson. There's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time. Two maids (a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone) plus Udo (Luis Induni) a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on Leila changing clothes takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit. Oh yeah and Borg the pet German Shepherd. Paul Naschy is Father Adrian Dunning the doubting priest (zzzzz) who starts snooping around after John and Richard both have their heads twisted around backwards. Leila tells him They say I am perverse and I'm going to prove it is true! During her birthday party she tells her guests You make me sick! I hate you all! and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches I don't want to see that fat ass! Debbie suggests they commit Leila to a sanitory but Leila runs off and joins the cult again. She is rescued (again) and brought back home (for the third time). By this point in the movie there's only about ten minutes left to go and all we've basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f-ed up their lives are and how Leila is acting weird. It's almost as agonizing to sit through as an Andy Milligan movie minus the gore and laughs. But finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies - an EXORCIST-like possession flick. Unfortunately the best part of it are the contact lenses Leila gets to wear. Some cheap time-lapse slashes appear on her arms legs and face she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles. She begins reeking of rotted flesh spits up some clear gunk starts speaking in her dead dad's voice sneaks into her mom's bedroom slaps her around a bit and calls her a filthy bitch of a whore. In comes Father Adrian who now finally believes she is indeed possessed fends off her attempts at seduction hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses Leila with holy water. Doors open and close a mirror breaks there's sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor. After she tackles Dunning and the two roll down the stairs the spirit is out of her and into - guess who? Why Borg the family pooch! The demon dog then turns on Adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker. Then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film. It's Leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self. But then there's ANOTHER time-lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body. It's so badly done you really have no clue what to make of it which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they've wasted an hour and a half on this worthless POS. Screw the contacts 1 out of 10 it is. ",negative
" The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. He sounds so concerned. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie. Jimmy Carter unlike Al Gore is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well. When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater. Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a 50% loss in revenue and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%. So just turning it off would not be a very good idea. This movie is a veiled appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything in the name of saving planet earth that is. ",negative
" The eight Jean Rollin film I have watched is also possibly the weirdest; the intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along! A would-be female vampire (scantily-clad as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote château and emerges only to 'feast' on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) As if unsure where all of this would lead him the writer-director ultimately has the human villain  actually the blank-faced hero's kinky father  ludicrously revealed as a mutant(?!) from the future! The languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are of course typical of both the film-maker (ditto the seashore setting at the {anti}climax) and the Euro-Cult style as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display. Personally the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six latter-day Luis Bunuel films) crop up bemusedly through it from time to time!

" You know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably? When you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? House of the Dead struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema. From start to end House of the Dead manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which they exploit shamelessly) whereas the males for their hardcore kick-ass attitude. I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least then we'll get better acting However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as: These are zombies pure and simple and No cap'n we must not go there! It's evil! . We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action blood and closet terror. Trash yes but entertaining trash. Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins. According to IMDb House of the Dead received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie. If only we could have had the same privilege. Final Score: 1/10. ",negative
" This review may contain some SPOILERS. Just when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore along comes Rae Dawn Chong as a space vixen and Willie Nelson as a Native American witchdoctor! It's even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of `Starlight ' a film that should only be viewed for laughs. Chong is an alien sent to Earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed part man and part alien. Apparently the Earth is in dire straits. Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland. Only by duplicating the DNA of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet. Don't ask me how that is since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution which is caused by humans. You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures not saving them! Anyway the half-breed turns out to be Billy Wirth a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother's line despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather is Willie Nelson. Wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic Carmen Electra bomb `The Chosen One' such a howler? Chong arrives in her ship just as Wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend. Before you can say utter the word `hogwash ' Chong is revealing her secret to Wirth who isn't surprised for a moment and spreading the word to Wirth's family. Chong also makes pals with Wirth's mother who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years. Well this is because Wirth's father was an alien that abandoned her. Of course he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirth's DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves. (Huh?) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie. Not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most. The ideas might be nice on paper but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien. But the effects are the bane of the movie. The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship communicating with her superior someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light. They use no spoken words but telepathy so we are treated to subtitles. Trouble is both Chong and her superior's subtitles both look alike and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually `speaking' at any given moment which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish. The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film. Now I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this but these effects really got to me. The most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky. The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone. Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades and we get a shot of the seven stars. Thing is the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all. These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment. Be careful for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . Oh it has to be seen to be believed! Starlight star bright; Last star I see tonight; I wish I might I wish I may; not have to watch any more of this trash today. Zantara's score: 1 out of 10. ",negative
" I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes I have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot. That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia who has the worst Australian Accent i've ever heared and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be at least it wasn't as bad as Going Overboard . ",negative
" The plot has already been described by other reviewers so I will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory. Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest prettiest examples of posh totty to have been committed to celluloid. Of her era and ilk only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close. What was it about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here. As a whole the movie is very poor and being of its time very cheaply made. The song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling. ",negative
" Oh my god. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old. the plot the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace. I am not usually this critical about any movie cause every person has his/her style. But this movie however was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown and i think it should stay like this for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke. I advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies or even simply movies to stay far away from this one. ",negative
" If Ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received. Instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in said their lines and picked up their paychecks without much conviction. Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in East Africa. Along comes Peter Ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a Moslem slave dealer. As Johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well. Of course Caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has such folks as William Holden Rex Harrison Omar Sharif and Indian film star Kebir Bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing. Usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery. But Ashanti doesn't even have that going for it. What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of tax write off is permeating the air. ",negative
" Buck's role as The Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker (of The Price is right) running a country the same way he runs his show. But there's lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey. Kurt Thomas as the baby-faced hero displays some considerable acrobatic skills but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever. There's a few spooky moments (in the Village of Crazies mostly) and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences. But any given Ninja movie will give you much more entertainment and you won't feel as guilty about laughing. ",negative
" I never much liked the Myra movie tho I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Certainly Miss Welch's costume became an iconic image though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about - I rewatched Myra on FMC a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years. There's a segment about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books where it's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production. However IMHO the movie is too bitter to be charming too silly to be a turn-on and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform engage OR entertain --- ",negative
" you must be seeing my comments over many films under Evren Buyruk ..I am off to make another comment over a movie that is not even worth a minute of talking though..This film is basically two hours of Dafoe's character drinking himself - nearly literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. It was just a grim sad waste of time. Willem Dafoe is excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this film just sucked. Slow doesn't make the movie bad it was just bad. The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep. (Seriously I fell asleep and had to re-watch the film - which was even more disappointing.) I generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film warranted one. It's just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result. ",negative
" Slashers.....well if you like horrors its definitely one to see otherwise don't even bother.It is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget For instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow trust me you wont need to look for them.Also try to ignore the cheesy actors if thats what you call them!!The basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live's at the end gets rich. Now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days For example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game! especially for $12.000.000. so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind.

" This is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesn't turn out to be a great movie. What starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS THELMA AND LOUISE SHOWGIRLS FRISK and even a curious dash of 400 BLOWS thrown in towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but in the end this slick well-produced flick doesn't quite add up to anything. However the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind-the-scenes world of gay porn. ",negative
" Very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue bad flashbacks and an almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men. O'Toole is riveting whenever he speaks; unfortunately he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he too is terribly underused. The film has one additional positive aspect in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Too many of today's films about WWII paint the Allies as all-good and the Axis as all-evil when history tells us people are far more complicated than that! This would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize this is the movie for you. ",negative
" A fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do. that being stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem solved . They are of course out foxed at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land. The film version and I use the term film very loosely is more of a god awful pastiche of American heist movies particularly the Oceans movies. They they even have George clooney as Mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely. So kudos to them .They'll make lots of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children book. ",negative
" This movie was horrible. I watched it three times and not even the whole thing. It's just impossible to watch the story line sucks it's depressing and utterly disgusting. I don't write spoilers for anything so if you want to know why it's so disgusting see it for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts in the movie. The little kid in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie at movie stores around America so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ was I wrong!!!! The acting is all horrible and the nudity itself is lame and nasty. Another thing is Starr Andreef the other main character hasn't been in such bad movies in the past in fact she was in some pretty good ones. Same with John Savage. This movie SUCKS! ",negative
" I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho-hum event . Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film probably the most intriquing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned Cole Younger ditto and Bloody Bill Anderson who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script. Instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about. how sad. The costumes were wonderful however as was the location shooting in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another film from the period and try again or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on . ",negative
" Trash/bad movies usually ain't bad because I will find them enjoyable. This one is so bad that I am out of words to describe it - its below bad . There is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie. Needless to say the instruction and a dozen of beer couldn't help me seat through the entire film. One tagliner compares this one to KILLBILL which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. Obviously. this tagliner had a plan to tempt you into buying this DVD. If you are considering renting this one put it down! If you are thinking of buying Dont think! If you unlucky to have this dvd dont play it throw it in trash bin immediately. ",negative
" Johnny Weissmuller's final film as 'King of the Jungle' after 16 years in the role TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans. At 44 the ex-Olympian one of Hollywood's most active 'party animals' was long past the slim athleticism of his youth and looked tired (although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS). Not only had Weissmuller gotten too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield the quintessential 'Boy' had grown to manhood (he was a strapping 17-year old) so he was written out of the script under the pretext of being 'away at school'. Brenda Joyce at 35 was appearing in her fourth of five films as 'Jane' (she would provide the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan in 1949's TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever. Produced by Sol Lesser at RKO on a minuscule budget the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in Mexico. While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest Africa veteran director Robert Florey utilized the country extensively incorporating cliff diving and an Aztec temple into the story. When a young island girl (Tyrone Power's future bride Linda Christian) is rescued in a jungle river by Tarzan he learns that a local high priest (George Zucco one of filmdom's most enduring villains) had virtually enslaved the local population threatening retribution from a living 'God' if they don't do his bidding. The girl had been chosen to become the 'God's' bride so she fled. Faster than you can say 'Is this a dumb plot or WHAT?' the girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and returned to the island and Tarzan followed by Jane colorful Spanish character 'Benjy' (charmingly played by John Laurenz who sings several tunes) and a government commissioner are off to take on the Deity and his priest (poor Cheeta is left behind). After a series of discoveries (the 'God' is simply a con man in an Aztec mask working with the priest in milking the island's rich pearl beds) a bit of brawling action and comic relief and songs by Benjy everything reaches the expected happy conclusion. Remarkably TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS features a musical score by the brilliant film composer Dimitri Tiomkin and is far better than what you'd expect from this 'B' movie! While the film would provide a less-than-auspicious end to Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loincloth (he would immediately go on to play Jungle Jim a more eloquent variation of the Ape Man in khakis) the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been. Tarzan was about to get a make over and become much sexier... ",negative
" I only hope that no classicists/ancient historians saw Cleopatra or if they did that they took it as a laugh. The movie is horrendously inaccurate more laughably even than Gladiator (which is at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story). Most blatant is Octavius Caesar's heir in the Senate before Caesar's assassination: at the ripe old age of 19! Besides this the acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond in him when he says Caesar. Julius Caesar. Billy Zane is a laughably dense Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela tries her best to be the seductive Pharaoh (who in real life was not good-looking at all) but comes off as unbelievable. So this is a warning for all historians--this movie is not true to life! ",negative
" F*ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p*ss! Honestly I can't express in words how bad this film actually is. Besides the plot that isn't really there the comically crap acting the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies; You know what I could go on all day. Every little thing in this film is either stupid pointless crap or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... don't! I'm ashamed to say I have this on my rack. It's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile. I couldn't even give this horse-sh*t excuse for a film away. That's how bad it is. ",negative
" Philip. K. Dickian movie. And a decent one for that matter. Better than the Paycheck (Woo) and that abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But lets face it the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me. Half way through the movie I already started to fear about such kind of ending and I was regrettably right. But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time. No not at all. First half (as already many here have commented) is awesome. There are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future (we will do such kind on corny sf things because we CAN) or is it simply over combining. But the paranoia is there and feeling out of joint also. Good one. ",negative
" I think that deep down in the darkest slimiest part of their heart everyone likes Jerry Springer just a little bit. While his show is undeniably offensive and stupid it also gives us a chance to see that relatively speaking most of us have it real good. When you look at the trailer park livin' dollar whiskey drinkin' incest lovin' people on the Springer show it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park. Jerry is performing a public service and we should be grateful. He ditched a political career to host the show just for us. What we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie Ringmaster . Ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show or so they would like us to think. The movie follows the pre-requisite Springer story line: Love triangles. One triangle involves Connie her daughter Angel and her husband Rusty. The other involves Starletta Vonda and Demond. When the two hapless groups meet up in LA their lives intertwine and collide head-on all culminating in an explosive episode of the Springer show. It's like what Short Cuts would be if Robert Altman had had a severe crack habit. Ringmaster is true to the show as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish. It also makes me very glad that I don't live in the squalor it's characters do. But the movie has a problem. It's billed as a comedy but it just isn't very funny. What laughs there are to be had are few and far between. Maybe some people watch this and laugh non-stop. If you think blow jobs and rape are funny well then I guess you're one of those folks. Personally I laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of white-trash life. The Jerry Springer Show just isn't meant to make the leap from TV to the silver screen. What's funny in an hour long show (less when you count commercials) isn't necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie. Movies have to tell a story and that's something else Ringmaster has trouble with. The story is threadbare. There are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder. And even if there weren't such problems how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story? Even the Hollywood formula couldn't make this better. Ringmaster: is so bad it even screws up the best part of the Springer show: the Final Thought. Somehow even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built around. The worst offender in all of this is Springer himself. He's such a bad actor that he can't even play himself convincingly. Watching Springer play Springer is sad. It's like he was going for a 'What if Woody Allen played Jerry Springer' vibe and he failed. Miserably. He went to the trouble of producing this disaster the least he could do is try to make it just that much better. Not that I'm saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance. Just the opposite. They all suck. Not so surprisingly no one in this movie went on to greatness. The best any of them was did was Molly Hagan landing a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom. Apparently Nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the '90's to star in a children's program. It makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts. Here are my Final Thoughts: What we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience. Should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely brain-damaged lumps of goo? I say no. Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed up world there is a perfect movie for each of us. We just have to keep looking for it. Until next time take care of yourselves and your loved ones. And don't ever watch Ringmaster . ",negative
" I found this a good movie to pass your time but not by any chance of any historical value. The portrayal of Cleopatra reminded me a cheap soap opera. The twist of the facts is... funny! She gave birth while feeding her people!?!? O please... A pregnant Queen of Egypt (especially this one) would not bother to go from one room to the other for that reason! They tried to make her appear a saint for God's sake! And the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister... beyond description. Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals. She did everything for only two reasons: Power and self-preservation! She was borne in a family where she had to straggle for survival something she did very well. Anything that stood on her way was either murdered (her brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). Unfortunately Octavian was too powerful to kill and too... gay to be seduced. So he was her end... ",negative
" I can count (on one hand) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is not one of them.

" We have an average family. Dad's a famous rapper we have the rebelious teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid. And we have careless housemaid what show has had a housemaid like that? Do we have a messed-up Brady Bunch? Yay! When it first came out I thought it was really cool mostly because I was young. The music was bad. The raps were so bad and they were too g-rated. All of his raps were about his family and friends and problems. The dad was kind of the Danny from Full House type of dad. Always gave the advice out. But he wasn't a clean freak. They had a house-keeper for that. Remember? The plots were basically Lil' Romeo was in trouble of some sort or... not that's it.

" Why is it that any film about Cleopatra the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making? Whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of them all Julius Ceasar and his successor Mark Anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors. Despite lavish sets and costumes this movie is as bad as any Italian sandals and toga extravaganza of the 50's. Admittedly this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why Gladiator went over well but Gladiator did not have all the romance novel sex. Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. Pity some of it didn't wash off on the others. ",negative
" Why oh why can't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale? This is the second adaptation of Beowulf I've been disappointed with in a year. But I have to say the previous version ( Beowulf & Grendel starring Gerald Butler) was far superior to this. That one was only a little disappointing. This one is a mess!!! What bugged me most? Was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason (Human sacrifices? Pointless love interest?) or the bad CGI or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting? Even worse was the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis look so horrible!!! And lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow? And why did they continually remind us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film. He was tossed around by both monsters he fought relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon. Even when he slugged the arrogant prince he didn't knock him out. He was much too reliant on weapons. Beo-wimp is more like it. This was certainly not the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem! I'd like to end this on a positive note but I can't really think of one offhand. All I can say is if you've ever read Beowulf you'll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal inaccurate excuse for an adaptation! ",negative

" 'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It is a very dark film and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself. It is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred. The film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours (contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. However despite the film's cleverness at portraying this idea the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across. It seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story. ",negative
" Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful. I wasn't going to comment but the film just bugs me so much and the writer/director in particular. So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers. I saw the original Wicker Man and really loved the cornucopia of music sensuality paganism in a modern world and the clash of theological beliefs. This said I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done. For example I liked the original 1950's Invasion of the Body Snatchers but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake. Both films can stand on their own. Another example is The Thing . The original as campy as it looks compared to today's standards has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell (my all time favorite horror movie). So that small minority of people who like The Wicker Man re-make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re-make. This film solidified for me Neil LaBute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies. It also made me wonder how executives wanting to make a serious thriller would green light a product that is so anti-female. There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion. The threat to the main character came from everyone male and female. There was no sexual hierarchy. The metaphor of bees drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient ( The drone must die! ) especially when Cage's character has bee allergies. I kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts. These were not women with special supernatural powers and half of them seemed to be pregnant the other half old and fat and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women. Physically dominate them. There didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy. But if they were content being drones why make them unable to speak? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community. They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated. (That movie was made already. The Stepford Wives anyone?) Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh*t together and were truly equal citizens. The problem with the man-hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out. I belief LaBute should've left the society an egalitarian one kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island. No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited. So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused thus an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children. LaBute has said he created the fiancé and daughter story thread to give Cage's character an incentive to search. I don't think you need that. Any child abused will make an adult react to save them. The irony of course would be that the child Cage saves ultimately brings him death. The dialogue was contrived and campy. The whole third act was hilarious. The audience I saw it with guffawed (and later booed at the end). I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is. We don't need that. Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child. Most of us in America have seen Law & Order and other cop procedurals. We come into the movie as if we are Cage's partner solving a mystery. So much potential...wasted. Neil LaBute stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort. Stay with your own company of men. Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers. Here is your jar of honey. I'll watch that. ",negative
" This seemed to be a good movie I thought it would be a good movie and throughout the movie I was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time and yes I have to admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval where truly commendable but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message which it seems is it seemed was what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens; a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied if indeed that was the director's intention. This falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most. Another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo-typing of the American characters - they all seem to be carved out of the same block. Seems to me that most American characters in Indian English movies are based upon how common Indians themselves perceive Americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American in the movie. These two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story. ",negative
" Well no not really. Its not really a good movie but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money and sometimes thats all you can ask for. The plot is OK nothing brilliant or new the acting is pretty bad but the cast is pretty. The directing is passable but the effects are horrible especially the werewolf effects which in a werewolf movie is a pretty big problem. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity which to me is a pretty good thing but it wasn't all that hot. All in all its a fairly average direct to video movie not the worst film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan check it out sometime. I'd even watch it again. Bonus fact for horror geeks Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf. ",negative
" Gee what a heck of a movie!... I said I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies from all decades so I decided to start by this one. It was a pretty adequate choice. I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces but I didn't see anything of the sort in this pastel-coloured mess. I haven't really watched many bad films before but I've got the feeling this is what's called so bad that's good probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny! First of all there are the inaccuracies. There are plot-related inaccuracies physical inaccuracies and also psychological inaccuracies. The latter in particular are as insane as Van Damme's ass cheeks inside that blue spandex. Extremely tacky lines exist too and I won't even start to talk about some of the hilarious action moves. There isn't exactly bad acting from everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie except in one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank which is an utterly stupid character. And to tell the truth I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing the twins. He succeeded in achieving a different tone and mood in the two roles that was convincing to me. But the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a major motion picture studio... which is now bankrupt. ",negative
" I really looked forward to see Planet of the Apes but it was a huge dissapointment. The settings and masks are great but that is the only good aspect of the film. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting he is just in the movie looking stupid. The other actors are also not very good. But the worst point of all is the story. It is absolutely ridiculous! For example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground but the humans don`t attack them no they wait until they are up again! This is just one example for the stupid story but it would take too long to tell them all. ",negative
" If movies like Ghoulies rip off Gremlins then Hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like Ghoulies. These barely-animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies (which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams - oh joy) but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica. They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell one suspects. There's no real plot - just goblins - kill! and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience. ",negative
" A friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio. To say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I'd ever read would be a bold understatement. Yet I never told him this. Why? Because in a world where films like While She Was Out can be green-lighted and attract an Oscar- winning star like Kim Basinger a screenplay lacking in character content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell. As so many other reviewers have pointed out While She Was Out is a dreadfully under-written Woman-in-Peril film that has abused housewife Basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve. Every gripe is legitimate from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw-dropping lapses of logic but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. Here are a couple of things that struck me: 1) I don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk the house IS a mess with toys. Since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves? 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen. 3) Sure the film is stupid. But so are the countless thrillers I've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not I found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors. 4) I LOVED the ending! 5) Though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase I really DO think this film should be retitled The Red Toolbox of Doom.

" As said before the visual effects are stunning. They're breathtaking. I personally use Blender and graphics like that are not easy AT ALL. But that's all this movie is. Not only is the plot confusing but the overall conflict is not clear. For example in the first scene Proog and Emo are trying to run away from who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later when they enter the room of the bottomless pit Proog explains that one step out of place and (you're dead) . Here there's a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. As the movie progresses it's clear that a conflict exists between man and nature. But suddenly a conflict exists between man and man when Proog out of nowhere murders Emo. Proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a sick man . He betrays us. Not only is this depressing but we don't care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed. It's not a story about someone through struggle emerging stronger. It's depressing and has not point because there's no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does. In my opinion the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects. However the graphics are stunning but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy. There's no truth no struggle and a bad surprise ending. In conclusion an underdeveloped movie without a point. ...but the graphics are good. ",negative
" I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb Blondie romantic interest or damsel in danger.But everything changed when she won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie L.A. Confidential and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance.However after that moment her career did not follow the ideal path.Sure the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor) but we have never seen her again on a substantial character.The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty but also that the movie is really crappy.The screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic.However Basinger brings some conviction to her character and that makes this poor movie to win a few points.This movie is full of clichés and generic villains.The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone.The ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous.I do not recommend While She Was Out at all.This film commits the capital sin of being boring.

" As far as I can understand TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. My doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student since there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts in the final credits. Nevertheless director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It doesn't matter for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you're studying cinema is how to tell a story. You learn that just like in novels in movies you should also construct your story in three acts: the introduction the development and the conclusion. You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn this is valid for a 3-hour-epic for the regular movie for a short film and even believe it or not for a 30-second commercial. You also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that ultimately you can even deconstruct it. In rough terms TIM WATCHER introduces us its main character and then the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Jeunet's AMÉLIE. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art film thus you can't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure. You are expecting to be told a story and it doesn't happen. Worst than that TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; and one with no real purpose. It doesn't make a point or at least not a valid one. Its point is childish with a sense of vengeance. The situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is Manichaean. I was expecting a lot more from this short. The movie opens with a rather good-looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular Portuguese short film. I don't know the budget for this movie but judging for the thanks-list in the end credits merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers. TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style color and carefully chosen plans combined with a fine score. That's all. There's nothing else. There's no plot. And that's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values. Hardly you can see in the regular Portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story. As absurd as the comparison may sound I must refer the BMW shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography.

" Not the worst movie I've seen but definitely not very good either. I myself am a paintball player used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change. The movie portrays similar qualitys First of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this Phantom guy or whatever they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags autocockers. One guy sporting a bushy. Not much wrong with the movie but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy. A bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting better guns . Another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah The phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the professionals . So what exactly is wrong with the movie? Well the budget is a huge thing a paintball movie WOULDN'T be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur. There are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is pretty bad too. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap. It just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what paintball is. To be honest real paintball isn't all buddy like it's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not respect and playing by the rules. Don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming 4 is 1!!  ",negative
" This film is pretty poor. The acting is abysmal and completely forced. Furthermore by shooting the film as a docudrama doesn't necessarily make it more believable you can't get out of it that easily Mr Dir. Don't let my comments mislead you however as i would recommend you watch this film as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to put it! It pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere! What takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation panic fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances. No instead it leaves you with jaw dropping Was that it?! spilling from your tongue and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions. Rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point.Zero Day indeed....zzzzzzzzzzzzz ",negative
" Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (**SPOILER**) needs a family member in order to do it. A failure as a horror movie because it simply ain't scary at all. Works better as a dark macabre black comedy to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer. (Too many wisecracks that's for sure.) The actors aren't interesting (save Robert Englund as always and an obviously slumming Yaphet Kotto) and there are simply far too many visual effects. The finale is OK but doesn't provide as many sparks as I think one might hope. In adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer's story it provides Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before. There are cameos worth noting: a joint cameo by then-couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold that is devoid of entertainment value an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker Alice Cooper and a funny cameo by Johnny Depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become. Film debut of Breckin Meyer who plays Spencer. One of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits. 4/10 ",negative
" I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that they basically came up with excuses -- rewrites budget constraints production formats etc -- simply underlines how bad this movie is. And my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut. It's watchable but barely so. There are plot holes in every corner the dialogue borders on the ridiculous and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would ya wrassle us up some Hamburger Helper Sally between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to MREs. Once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone. The rationale for the encounter with the fearsome Rook is that it can't be killed single handedly. Yet only one scene ago the hero making that case abandoned King to do exactly that. Huh? Vivian Woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie. But that's not saying much. ",negative
" I was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.But it turned out to be the the biggest let down. A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss. It was vulgar and distasteful I don't think Dr Seuss would have approved.How the Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on. Whereas The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than I would have liked.Growing up with Dr Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .Lets see what they do with Horton hears a who.I hope this one does Dr Seuss some justice.

" I read Rice's novel with interest and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths. However I was simply APPALLED at this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based merely on physical appearance and not acting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher who was neither blond-haired or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag). The cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a French accent was hilarious but not in an entertaining way. I found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe and was surprised I made it to the end. A warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one. ",negative
" This movie isn't about football at all. It's about Jesus/GOD!! It's the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for Jesus or pump iron for Jesus. Yeah Jesus was totally buffed liked contact sports and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells. DUHHH! This movie should have been entitled Hiking for Jesus or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to Christianity and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb. That the title is derived from the Bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his Bible and asking Jesus for help. The recent sports movie Invincible was 100 times more inspiring than this was and Jesus wasn't even a factor. It was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream. Any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant Bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda. One gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept Jesus as your personal savior. But this is simply not true and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it. The image of the winning athlete thanking Jesus when he wins comes directly to mind. What does he do when he loses? Does he curse Jesus? Of course not! When he loses Jesus isn't responsible. Jesus is only responsible when he wins. And the logic goes round and round and round and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be every time!! I had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so I could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath. Materialism is not what Jesus taught. I find it odd that most so called Christians seem to either forget or ignore this message from their savior especially when I see a Jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling SUV that passes me like I'm standing still. Another message this movie implies is that Jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world. The final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey. I only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act. ",negative

" This movie has not aged well. Maybe it's just the impact and artful characterization acting and directing that we've seen with The Sopranos but I just viewed Prizzi's Honor for the first time on DVD alone. The experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different but I have to say I was just appalled at the ending. Not just the violence of it but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending. I enjoy a good shocker but this seemed so out of character... Also when was this move supposed to be set? The cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s and yet the World Trade Center towers {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes. Another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person. Somehow mid-1980s audiences found this film charming and funny. Mid-eighties meet the late oughts: only of you can live. ",negative
" When we were in junior high school some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs. It was considered funny then. But the producers directors and cast of Semana Santa ( Angel of Death in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and they are STILL setting them off. Like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home I doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes. Mira Sorvino hot in Mighty Aphrodite and other top-rated films seems to have undersold herself to this project. Her acting is non-existent confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how sensitive she is to the plight of the film's various victims. But let me warn you--do not be the next victim! Step away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. Tbere are not many good leg shots of Mira (the only high points I could find in the film) and the supporting cast is of inferior quality delivering a mishmash of badly-done dialogue with embarrassing Spanish accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production.

" Tainted look at kibbutz life This film is less a cultural story about a boy's life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general. In the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves. And it's all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim. Besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of wellevil. The story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. There is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz. Every character/situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc. For example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality. He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers like trash. After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn't seen in a long time due to his military service he orders Quote  Linda go take shower and I cum in two minutes. There is one other good character in this movie  a European foreigner who plays the mother's boyfriend. When the animal rapist tries to hit the mother's son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm. He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members. More hypocrisy: The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act that's supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid. She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy's mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult. Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. The mother apparently can't escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone was/is always free to come and go as they choose. It's a mystery how the boy's father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son. That's the gist of this movie. One dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience's head  that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didn't fit in. I feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz. But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs. ",negative
" Faces are slashed throats are cut blood squirts and in end the three main characters are either depressed or they die. They even blow up Kevin Costner's dog with a shotgun. Why would anyone want to see a movie like this? Violence is valid only when the good guys kill the bad guys not the other way around. Take for instance Underworld and Underworld Evolution where you can enjoy seeing justice done when the demons are slain. In this movie the good guys are cut up. See the difference? Why would anyone want to MAKE a movie that depresses the audience? Beautiful photography and skilled editing in a motion picture like this is a waste of talent. Let's put this one into the category of the exquisite corpse. ",negative
" This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films. First let's admit that 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people the horror!. Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school? Doesn't Buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people? ",negative

" I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I did see was Quentin Tarantino's seeming insane obsession for it... There were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality. Overall however I found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous. The hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks I found clumsy and dizzying even sickening. Overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the U.S. military against various malcontents. The various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and conclusions. A depressing movie (not a true _film_ a term I reserve for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a romantic comedy though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content form and conclusion any association with this genre. I suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of IMDb and other ratings sources. ",negative
" This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichés from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film what he ended up with was a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore the movie is largely devoid of scares (although in fairness there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery). *MILD SPOILERS* We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin diabolical librarians ghostly love interests identity confusion death by savage monkeys oedipal conflict abusive stepfathers sublimated homosexuality and crime gang connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary. *END SPOILERS* Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological ambiguous horror tale check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003). ",negative
" And I mean ultra light. This film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that. There really isn't too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isn't very funny. Nor does it work at all as a romance. How about as a romantic comedy? Not on your life. Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusing. What's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all. This movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics. The film uncovers the un-mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews. But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance. The same with Catherine Zeta-Jones' character -- the whinny self centered movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she's given but she's given practically nothing. It's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years. In the end it is hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones Julia Roberts John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of The Love Boat. In fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. It would probably make a better story. So go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this? ",negative
" Because some people like me like to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they plan to see it including the ending. Anyway here's the ending as I remember it because I couldn't have been more than 8 yrs old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV. But I'll tell ya it sure scared the little kid that I was and I thought about it for days afterward and it still stands out in my mind to this day even though some of the details are a little vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I don't remember that! I didn't even remember that ol' Barnabus was in this movie and I LOVED Dark Shadows. So at the end the lead character (Belinda Montgomery?) is lured by the Judge (Joseph Cotton I'm guessing even though I remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge; see how memory fades?) to the wedding place which as I remember it is in a cavern of some kind? Maybe I've got that wrong; and Shelley Winters is there laughing and the Judge has a cape on and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him and he throws back the cloak and he has goat legs and he announces he's actually her father the Devil and she's played right into their (the satanic cult's) hands because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with (I guess that's Robert Foxworth) turns out also to be the guy Satan wants to marry her off to The Demon with Yellow Eyes and yep sure enough they show Robert Foxworth and his eyes glow yellow. There are a lot of close-ups in the last few minutes of the film. Everyone is laughing and rejoicing except for Belinda Montgomery who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something and that's the end. The bad guys win. ",negative
" I'll try to use words to describe this on.... I saw the original which was good in its own way but back then I should have feared a sequel. And I was 'afraid' when I picked this one up but now that I've seen it I have to say it's even worse then I thought. Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin. Let's start with the actors;they aren't all that good but it has to be said some make heads turn by being just plain awful. But what can an actor do with a script like this one. It's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn't been done before fails miserably. In a futile attempt to get it up-to-date they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big-brother' theme but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad. In conclusion if you have nothing and I mean nothing to do... go watch it or play Frisbee... with the DVD.... by yourself. It'll offer you the same amount of fun.. I promise ",negative
" This is listed as a documentary it's not it's filmed sort of like a documentary but that I suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming. This has just been released in the UK on DVD as an American Pie style comedy it's not that either. Basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to Mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid. Throw is a couple of dwarfs also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls. Considering the 18 Rating this has very little nudity and practically zero sex scenes mainly I guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty. If you like crude Jackass behaviour without the humour then this may be your thing if you have any brain cells left then I would probably avoid this! ",negative
" Movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it. The dialog was bad. Women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures. And two of the supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese had Chinese names and spoke with clearly Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why the Emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a tough choice: Do I give this movie a rating of one? or two?

" It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone Brian DePalma Al Pacino and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage. It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable trite and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time. This movie represents the worst of Hollywood. What is this? Is it based on a true story. Well they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today. But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine. Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie. The accents are totally fake and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values. The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show. Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida. Afterall a palm tree is a palm tree. Is this a romance novel. The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. Is this a drug movie? Well no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. Admittedly the acting is terrible. Let's get to the rest. The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show. I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly the photography budget was excessive. The sound is bleached in a number of spots and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. The writing is appalling. This is one of those movies were the script writes itself. You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks. So I am going to ask Is this even a movie? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. But at least a drama series has some kind of focus. Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together. Whatever it is movie or not it is a piece of crap. ",negative
" The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton Julia Stiles Jerry O'Connell Jeremy Sisto Jordana Brewster Leonard Roberts Bill Smitrovich Annie Corley Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull incoherent and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release). ",negative
" What made the French Connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe directed by Frankenheimer (who also brought us such gems as Raindeer Games and the Island of Dr. Moreau) the movie focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession of capturing Charnier (Rey). The fictitious idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of the French local authorities is laugh out loud funny. Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack!!! A street value of 32 million but yeah let's send Doyle to find this guy it was his pinch after all. Please!!! The story was weak. The acting was terrible (with the lone exception of Hackman who completely overplayed his part). The direction was all over the place. Even the cuts between scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one. ",negative
" What an appalling film. Don't get me wrong Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors but aside from a few interesting set pieces the film is mostly taken up with hysterical submariners shouting crying sweating and generally freaking out when anything goes wrong. Take that with simplistic asides to make sure the audience still understand what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairman how he must be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke) and you have a dumbed down thriller not worthy of the acting. Let us just hope that the real nuclear US Navy is not in the hands of such a script! ",negative
" RUN...do not walk away from this movie!!!!! Aimed at the very young kids this movie will bore you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90's raised the bar this film just lowered it. It's slow paced and the monster fighting is good but seldom seen. This movie had me dry heaving in the cat box. Just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90's series. SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons Gamera fans of the 90's series will HATE this film. 10. This movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby Gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult Gamera die. 9. You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film. He gets his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and self destructs??? He looks old and lethargic. Plus he looks nothing like any gamera you've ever seen. His suit looked cheap and rushed. 8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon. Big-eyed and cute...it will remind you of the baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute. 7. This movie has the pace of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay. I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along. I've seen an SUV full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster. 6. Like Godzilla:Final Wars this movie had very little kaiju time on screen. Final Wars had much more actually and better fights although short. 5. Kids take the title role. The friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970's and history repeats itself in the 2000's. The most successful Gamera films abandoned the Sesame Street feel and went to a darker place. Why go back to a failed formula? This was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue (thank god). 4. Gamera lost his iconic roar. He now sounds like an Elephant with strep throat. 3. This movie may produce a new Olympic event.....Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm's way. You have to see the ending to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yea..right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone. 2. The special effects were good but sub-par for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was showing the apple sized baby Gamera fly. Not too impressive. 1. This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect. The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows. It comes off like a cross between ET Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Kudos if you know all 3 references. Rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series. ",negative
" This movie is being shown over and over on cable lately so.. There is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either Luke Wilson or the equally vapid 'villian' in this movie. The female actresses are very cute and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it is 'funny' that Luke's even uglier/dorkier/stupider friend is around but well that is what we get. Neither of the female leads would ever EVER talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in Friday the 13th 4. Dead *@$# ",negative
" Spoiler!! I love Branagh love Helena Bonham-Carter loved them together in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein - but THIS - I can understand an actor's desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well they did but really - the script droned on Bonham-Carter's clothes were tres chic and the occasional speeded-up madcap sequence could have been an outtake from a Beatles' movie or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh-In. I never got the point - other commenters say the Branagh character was a dreamer. I never felt that. He was a loser and not very bright and certainly not endearing. The business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch. Certainly not amusing. Bonham-Carter's realistic (one supposes) attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire accent in Full Monty. The poetic ending with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated. Was there a choir of angels or merely a soundtrack? Go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it. Donate this to PBS. ",negative
" This is quite possibly the worst Christmas film ever. The plot is virtually non-existent the acting (Affleck in particular) is poor at best. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree. As far as I could gather the plot consisted of Ben Affleck a millionaire salesman is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. On doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for Christmas... and that is it. The film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family.... blah blah blah. ",negative
" Wow here it finally is; the action movie without action. In a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future Seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood. There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly Matrix without having the money to do it right. Yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then. And yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes. Believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get. In fact it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money. ",negative
" Have not watched kids films for some years so I missed Here Come the Tigers when it first came out. (Never even saw Bad News Bears even though in the '70s I worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie Warriors Man Who Would Be King and Rocky Horror Picture Show among others.) Now I like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on. Just minutes into this movie I could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for his/her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job. Lo and behold I spied Wes Craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer. He'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the Scream movies. Maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic. More surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the cast credits as Aesop a wacky character in the movie. F.J. Lincoln from the '70s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films. He was associated with the adult spoof The Ozporns and just that title is funnier than all of Tigers attempts at humor combined. Let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel. ",negative
" I've now seen this film twice and I must say I enjoyed it both times. It's fast paced and fun but ultimately daft. Having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original. It is clear for those who have seen the awful 'Zombie Creeping Flesh' that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to Bruno Mattei and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to Fulci. This is not idle Fulci sycophancy the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout and you can tell who directed what particularly in Mattei's case. The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus (oddly referred to as 'top secret' by a scientist it's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind) somewhere in south east Asia. The virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land. Our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians. The film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick and an out and out action adventure and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves. They do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all. Some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety so well rendered in the original and probably Fulci's creation here. The other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu: Indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims. Martial arts skills aren't their only talents either they are well versed in guerilla tactics hiding on rafters and under bales of hay and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves. This is all definitely the work of Mattei. There is a third more chatty variety of zombie. This type apparently retain a sense of irony as well 'I'm really thirsty...FOR YOUR BLOOD'. The ridiculous twist at the end in which the DJ turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind only serves to enhance the WTF factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution. Then there's the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face as if to say 'yeah we know how bad this looks'. The characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect. But its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously. Having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace. Indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro and one of the only effective scenes in the film. The guy who played the chief scientist has heart but no talent utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. The scientists' on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing 'now lets put these two molecules together!' There are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however. In an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor all shot in an atmospheric diffused light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her. His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead and this is quite tense. Things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs. But this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been. All in all I would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest rather than simply a through and through bad film. If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that I've come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties. ",negative
" Surely no Saturday morning TV kids' show was ever done this poorly. After all those producers had to count on the audience coming back. Well in this awful offering they could at least count the money they saved on sets. The script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline so the action just plods boringly along. The spaceship props are absurd--a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter for example--but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history. Most are crude drawings and it's all bathed in an often misfocused red light. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop. And it's a bad one--as rib-thin as the plot. Any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians--and will probably agree completely! ",negative
" Home Alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies. It's the cream of the crop or s*** if you tend to be more cynical as it ranks up (or down) there with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact it could even be worse than those two since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. This just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling. No other movie has made me cringe in pain. Now I will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious. First off the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Dumb stuff. The action that ensues is similar to that of the other two Home Alones with boobytraps and all but watching these boobytraps being executed is rather than being funny incredibly unpleasant to watch. I didn't laugh (or even so much as smile) once rather I cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. The bird rather than providing comic relief was unfunny and annoying. The acting as done by a bunch of no names ranges from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid while the terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits look) as they've been hastily picked off the street...and well that's it. I can see some people saying: Man it's for the kids. Don't dis it man. Well MAN kids may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting this out. Hell even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suck - see those reviews for more) are better than this! So in short this is an irredeemably atrocious movie. This was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely rips off the first two; the only thing is it completely insults the first two as well. No human kid or otherwise should find any reason to see Home Alone 3. Ever. It's THAT bad. 0/5 stars ",negative
" To grasp where this 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN is coming from consider this: Its final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second close-up followed by another two-and-half-minute freeze frame of Ms. Streisand -- striking a Christ-like pose -- behind the closing credits. Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra's distinctive visage dead center filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. That just might be some sort of cinematic record. Or think about this: The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars yet while Streisand's songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar Kris Kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs. Nor though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties do they actually sing a duet. Or consider this: Streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times including taking credit for musical concepts and her wardrobe (from her closet) -- and she also allegedly wanted but failed to get co-directing credit as well. One of her credits was as executive producer with a producer credit going to her then-boyfriend and former hairdresser Jon Peters. As such Streisand controlled the final cut of the film which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. What it doesn't explain is how come given every opportunity to make The Great Diva look good their efforts only make Streisand look bad. Even though this was one of Streisand's greatest box office hits it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance. Anyway moving the melodrama from Hollywood to the world of sex-drugs-and-rock'n'roll Streisand plays Esther Hoffman a pop singer on the road to stardom who shares the fast lane for a while with Kristofferson's John Norman Howard a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to Has-beenville. In the previous incarnations of the story Norman Maine sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer Vicky Lester achieve her success. In the feminist seventies Streisand & Co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man so the trajectory is skewed; she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one; he's a burden she must endure in the name of love. As such there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher but almost ruthless while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit. Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance and oddly it serves his aimless listless character well. Streisand on the other hand exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. Everything she does seems if not too rehearsed at least too controlled. Even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical. The two have no chemistry making the central love affair totally unbelievable. You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence though at age 34 Streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive. The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom. And indeed had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way to make Streisand's character openly play an exploitive villain the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist. But I guess the filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim; they don't seem to be aware just how cold-blooded and self absorbed she is. But sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points: note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio The Oreos. And the film makes a big deal of pointing out that Esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of Hoffman yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from Esther Blodgett so that Streisand won't be burdened with a name that is too Jewish or too unattractive. So much for ethnic pride. The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees. And the film did serve its purpose producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes (including the Oscar-winning Evergreen by Paul Williams and Streisand). But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be a vanity project. ",negative
" ...which isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Overall DinoCroc was a much better movie. Sure in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the DinoCroc. But the special effects in DinoCroc were better the plot lines were better and the acting was better. Here are the problems with Blood Surf -- 1) the killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. get shipwrecked on a deserted island in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there's not enough croc time. There are a couple of redeeming qualities of Blood Surf -- the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie. But if you're on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one Matt Borlenghi/killer crocodile movie skip this one and fire up DinoCroc instead. ",negative
" It's not so much that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION had little potential. Indeed the under-explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and for at least the opening half this Tobe Hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy '90s horror can. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's on-again-off-again performance and the overly intricate plot this would-be thriller loses its way. Dourif featured here before his built-in horror fan base had accumulated is average guy Sam. Of course average guys don't stay average for long in horror movies so after a well-done origin outline we see Sam's various body parts start to ignite. Soon he's igniting other people too much to the consternation of gal pal Lisa played unmemorably by Cynthia Bain. While the title of the film implies a fire-happy monster on the loose director Hooper opted to make Sam an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower. We're left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight-up villain-versus-everyone effort ala NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a pretty nominal effort when all is said and done. It will carry added appeal for Dourif's fans and those who can't get enough 1990s horror be it good bad or in between but only on a slow night. ",negative
" Yes the first Howling was a classic. A rather good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. Yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure...well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. Oh sure they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie however I read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before but still read the script before you take a role. Maybe you could have gotten into An American Werewolf in London hell that could have been possible. It was set in London after all. Heck werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude's ear's started bleeding. ",negative
" What are people on here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so bored that I walked out of the theater. What is up with this stuff. I only laughed once and not even that hard. Whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten. I usually always find something I like in a movie but this is crazy. Slackers makes Not Another Teen Movie look like a classic. It ranks up there with such trash as Body Shots Con Air and Conspiracy Theory as one of the worst of all time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies but to my dismay that wasn't happening. Looks like I will never see that money again or the two hours. ",negative
" Absolutely fantastic. Now before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés allow me to elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. Of course they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. Whilst there really are very very few positives to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out flushed with laughter buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making. Whichever way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film. P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film free...so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was THAT bad. ",negative
" METAMORPHOSIS I am working my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set. Released in 1990 METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of The Atom Age Vampire which also featured a scientist striving for similar results. Set in modern times METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie. A university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging. Pressured by the administration to publish his papers; and produce some results (or risk losing funding) the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner! The acting is stilted; and the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film. The score is pandering. And the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious; it's absurd; it's ridiculous  at best. As others noted the end turns into a 30+ minute gag which is seemingly endless. Without giving too much away I'd call this one Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creature From the Black Lagoon meets Home Alone.  ",negative
" Oh man it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science well I guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to make this issue sound complicated even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big hoax by a man with his own moneymaking agenda! How have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet? By estimating the sun spot activity. Has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate? No not even Gore himself! So how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past? According to sun spot activity the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be. How come the temperature in the entire universe has risen (relatively) equal much as on earth? Does our SUVs cause temperature on Jupiter to rise? Use some common sense! You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a HOAX. Please research it yourself. What does Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (banking family that arranged live earth event) to gain from this? Well the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits that is tax on everything that gives CO2 omissions and it is easier to get away with these taxes if the people are lured to think it is to save the world when it is only about money centralized control and more power to the elitist bankers. Al Gore has even a company that sells carbon credits! Is it not noble to pay voluntarily carbon credits to save the world especially if it goes into his own company? I do not want you to blindly believe me please do your own research and use your own common sense and I am sure you will come to the right conclusion! ",negative
" yeah cheap shot i know but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of 'deepness' (political turmoil love/lust) can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim (see also 'american beauty'). kaufman's movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences (in one scene i counted three different 'generic European' accents affected by the actors) and displays of state might run amok yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered. and in its over-long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot and in this manner sacrifices the novel's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs. it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas' son used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel. combined with the overweening soundtrack these flaws make this movie's three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content.

" This movie wasn't awful but it wasn't very good. I am a big fan Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The movie starts off about Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid. The book is great and he cant't believe a kid wrote it. Toni Collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists or if she's making it all up. I am not gonna ruin the movie but I will say this the movie is not scary. The acting is pretty good and Toni Collette's performance was awesome as well as Robin Williams. The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD. ",negative
" A one is the highest rating I could have given this movie considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee yew pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b-list actors who have done better work written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns and poop and fart jokes. For example Gene Stapelton's (Ding-Bat from All in the Family) character telling Marilu Henner's character that she swings both ways sexually was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie... You want good cheeky humor? Rent Animal House American Pie (part one only) Old School or Office Space. ",negative
" this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out im guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i didn't have to pay for it in short DUMB ASS MOVIE don't see it...but then again thats my opinion ",negative
" Shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. Unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters all of whom die. OK so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb. Fine fine! There is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes right? Yet again NO! In fact many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely in my opinion). I'm talking about things like Lalala I'm walking along and I- *neck gets slashed*. THE END for that character. Not even halfway through the film I threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it. ",negative
" A surprising misfire from the usually reliable Larry Cohen (God Told Me Too Q etc.) Full Moon High tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably even with decent turns by Ed McMahon(!) and Kenneth Mars.

" I am very unpolitically correct guy so when I say sexist I really mean it reduced the female guest lead Dr Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. in spite of all her supposed brilliance and self control to nothing more inside but a big jealous unreasonable baby You prolly got the plot by now after her technical sidekick Marvik also a spurned lover flips out when he tried to kill the Medusan Ambassador Kollos out of a jealous rage but glimpsed first it instead. (You think he could have just walked in to the room with his eyes shut and phasered the box too easy) he takes the Enterprise into un-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could subdue him. Well the ship is stuck in limbo at that point they could have gone to the good lady doctor-liaison and discussed it. Spock has to make a mind meld with the Medusan so we can get home. I mean like beetch do you want to stay adrift until we run out of supplies and die? But the lady in true Star Trek fashion is a jealous monsters who whines and wails when the idea is broached even when her Medusan idol told her to shut up & go along with them. So the beetch out of spite messes with the melded Spock causing him to forget to put on his visor which makes Spock go insane. Kirk naturally figured out what a total twit she was and shamed her into fixing Spock up with her superior telepathic powers. Of course at the end the Lady and Medusan leave and all is forgiven. You almost wish the President from Battle Star Galactica showed up to jettison the witch out of an airlock for her destructive stunt. But in Star Trek land ladies are permitted to be totally unreasonable and cruel yet at the same time supposedly there is sexual equality. This is what I mean by sexist. ",negative
" I mean really. This is not going to help the Australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind. Okay if you're a stoner and have nothing better to do then maybe.

" Curiosity led me to this masterpiece . Unfortunately I didn't rent it I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin' good ! And with all the flash-backs and flash-forwards I had trouble following the story. All in all Jeremy Renner's performance wasn't too bad. You can catch him in S.W.A.T. in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop. Anyway I would rate this as a 1/10. It only got a 1 because of Renner's so-so performance. There are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this one. ",negative

" It's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life melodramatic overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror. If comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and yes it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial contortions. Throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad. ",negative
" I think that can sum up this show about as well as anything. Batman TAS may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet. It's just too damn good. Was Batman Beyond good? Yeah but it was no TAS. Is Justice League good? It's not too bad but it's no TAS. The Batman is certainly no TAS either but I won't hold that against it. It would be unfair and besides it has plenty of other problems with it. The concept of a younger less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one and at times the art is very nice. But all of the rest of the time the art is worthless Americanime and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself. It is paced written and designed like an Americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures I'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect. The Joker is a homicidal mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits unpredictability and clever gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight hand to hand he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched. He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung-fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air accompanied by speed lines. If they had wanted to do that with a villain there were other less important characters they could have used or *gasp* they could have created a new one entirely. And it's not that re-imaginings are a bad thing don't get me wrong. TAS (there I go again) took Mr. Freeze from your standard icegun-wielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character. Of course Freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade but the point stands. What The Batman does is it takes everything you liked about Batman comics and lore and takes a large smelly dump on them. Guess what? They were eating corn. It's obvious this show can't stand against TAS but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn't work for me. The plots aren't good and they don't develop any better. They've been written for the demographic of children under twelve. Should children be able to enjoy a show? Of course they should. This shouldn't be an adult show with swearing nudity and gratuitous violence. But the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages. This show misses that mark. Is this show a TAS? No of course not. The problem is it's not even a JLU. ",negative
" This movie is a blatant attempt by the left in Hollywood to portray Reagan's administration as incompetent and bungling.

" I just finished a marathon of this series and it became agonising to watch as it progressed. From the fictionalising of the historical elements to O'Herlihy's awful accent in later episodes the show just slumps the further it goes. If you are looking for some low quality production generalised WW2 fluff then I could recommend season 1 but avoid anything after that it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility. The old B&W film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the Colditz name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for. ",negative
" Just PPV'd this. I don't want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than I ever could but I did want to say a few things. I didn't know which was funnier: Redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse; Close wailing that her precious boy (whom she and the Mr. had decided was a drunken loser) has been turned into roadkill; that the tone-deaf Ann schmoozed with Peggy Lee; or the horrid CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie gazing at her younger self! I never bought Danes as the younger Redgrave. I didn't buy Richardson and Collette as sisters either. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress she better get Mama to give her a few lessons! I had zero idea why any girl (or Buddy) would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she Luc is a retarded slacker on crack and I didn't give a rot about any of them! Evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name! ",negative
" I have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it. However I can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. However just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make. Granted this movie is supposed to be a B movie nothing to be taken seriously however you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie. Perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer but no they indeed made a full movie and a rather weak one at that. ",negative
" After Disney's witty live-action George of the Jungle I had high hopes for this flick. Major disappointment. Thread bare plot bad acting bad visual effects. This film relied on lame one-liners idiotic ( and pointless) product placement and the lamest most annoying side-kick in that gadget car thing. I took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind. The only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin! ",negative
" Christ oh Christ... One watches stunned incredulous and possibly deranged as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this movie actually exist or was I the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of films and a lot of bad films but nothing prepared me for this; by the end of it I was a gibbering snivelling wreck tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog clawing at the walls howling till my lungs were sore. I pleaded desperately frenziedly for mercy (to whom this appeal was made I don't know) and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet Weeping Jesus the memories... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm at my most vulnerable when I'm least able to handle them. I shudder I break down in tears I bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood but I can't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind. I'm haunted. I'm damaged. I'm a shell of a man. The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does in fact exist or b) I am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is quite mind-boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal or at least have not been left traumatised by it. Perhaps they're part of the operation. God damn them the maniacs!

" Uh oh! Another gay film. This time it's showing the black side. Bet your last dollar it's gonna have an unhappy ending! But WHY? With only less than a half dozen exceptions ALL gay films have to end in death or an addio finale. It's like all the European Film Noir releases in the 40's 50's 60's and 70's. The lead...male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion. Why in God's name must writers directors and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed? After all it's supposed to be gay...not glum. Maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' film. A large percentage of gay relationships DO last and the couples DO ride off together into the sunset! No matter who writes or produces he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. If you rent the DVD take an antidepressant for here comes another 'gay' film! This is WRONG! ",negative
" ...when he remade Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Recasting Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help a screenplay that was 'dated' in 34 let alone 50. This sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles unless they were dead. Though being older did not seem to matter to the Director. Nor that the Cars and Clothes in the background plates from 1934 did not seem match up too 1950s' standards. Not even 'der Bingel' singing can redeem this effort. We rated both the original and the remake IMDb Four****Stars. Frank's touch was long gone and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. That did not stop Mr. Capra though. After floundering around the 50's making some educational documentaries he wound up his career remaking LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again a fine cast was let down on that IMDb Six******Star effort compared too the originals Eight********Stars. Sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead right after STATE OF THE UNION (1948). ",negative
" I agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. I found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading misinforming and harmful (at worst). Like others I found this film to be an awful mix of real science and pseudoscientific New Age propaganda. As a psychologist I was especially offended by Candace Pert's contributions. True I was not a fan of hers before this film but her discourse on the consciousness of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term ( consciousness ) that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. It is an old Orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay Politics and the English Language. To refer to consciousness in this manner--indeed to refer to this film as based in science in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by Stalin when he labeled his slave-states democratic republics and Hitler when he called his party a socialist workers movement. I don't claim to really understand quantum physics. I know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. Ah but we Americans do love instant enlightenment and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. If it ASKED questions that would be one thing but it clearly attempts to ask and ANSWER them which no film could possibly do simply because we are far far away from the answers (if they indeed exist). By the way ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several expert commentators with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM) not to mention J.Z. Knight who often speaks in her Ramtha voice. (I'm always amazed at this channeled 10 000 year-old Atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. But then again this film argues that the past present and future are all one and the same so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10 000 years ago I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. Only then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? Oh I forgot I'm the creator of good and bad advice so it's all my fault not Ramtha's.) What a mess. ",negative
" I guess there are some out there that remember Nicole Eggert from her little girl days on such TV shows as T.J. Hooker Charles in Charge and Who's the Boss? You perverts you! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants. No matter you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about man-eating aliens. There are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained. How did she recognize the alien? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon? Why didn't the alien eat her? You get the picture. Before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity you get to see her in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican/Ukranian beauty is the only reason to watch this trash.

" Watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again. Even when you thought That mackerel surely can't be coming around again *slap* there it was. I'm not sure what they were thinking. This is the sort of pilot I watched and wondered Did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series? Not only black stereotypes but Swedish and Indian ones as well. And while Blazing Saddles made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness these stereotypes were just downright offensive. There was no plot line the ending was slapped on and the jokes aren't. Still if you are a student of comedy watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do. ",negative

" I'll just put it out here that was the Worst sequel to a classic Disney film I've EVER seen. In 1950 Disney released what I hail as one of his greatest films of all time. Now Take away the great songs add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. Put it together and what do you get? the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After i saw this I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should've ended with and they lived happily ever after. not this garbage. This film did not deserve a sequel like this. I thought it would be like A twist in time which was moderate but better than this. Also What do we care of Anastasia? She switched sides like Iago did but it didn't help anyone. ",negative

NOTHING in it makes any sense. none of it is clever or well thought out. out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop-out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothing's there. thats OK to do once maybe but i counted three times. there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters half-formed story lines.... the characters weren't well developed at ALL. the ending was.. bad. bad bad bad everything every component of this film is terrible. and I'm just here to warn you all of that.

" After watching this movie on DVD I watched the trailer. The voice-over describes the movie as surreal. Well there's surreal and there's surreal. There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me but frankly it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual imagery particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor were so nonsensical they had no meaning. I don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything but these scenes just seemed irrelevant. My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else would explain what was going on. Unfortunately nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about what his perspective was or even his emotional state. All I could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance and that he had a crush on an older boy. I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become but not much else did. Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision. Still as tiresome and as content-free the movie was for me it was a definite change of pace. I very much liked Madagascar Skin and I had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative and perhaps even style. It didn't even come close. For me there's no question about it: this movie deserves an A for effort but a D for execution. ",negative
" Before I start let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing which I gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some. So it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new DVD version would make a difference. I have also not read the corresponding book; I'm only familiar with one other Japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context. Potential minor spoilers ahead. I usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories (the likes of Blade Runner 12 Monkeys etc.) but I did not enjoy this movie at all. While it started out mildly intriguing it became tedious by the time it was only half-way finished. There are all sorts of problems; let's start with what is probably the most severe: the dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they aren't shouting each other's names for the n-th time they are usually grunting monosyllables ( Kanedaaa! Tetsuoooo! Huh? Grrr etc.). This leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It doesn't help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals. The grunting is augmented by some random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - it all seems haphazard thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci-fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever. What little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction. Not that there's anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction of course; but in this case you'll find yourself asking what's the point of it all and how long until it's over . Character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no readily apparent reason. The ending resembles the one in 2001 - a bizarre string of images that far from resolving or explaining anything leave the viewer feeling he's just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art; but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes. (Some of the music was also quite interesting). Unfortunately it's all style and no substance. Tired of Disney? Want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with adult themes? I'm sad to say you're more likely to find that sort of thing in South Park . ",negative
" This esteemed production has it's fans. But to paraphrase the classic bad review of 'Mary Reilly ' Moby Dick is like a painting only slower. This is because the philosophical grounds for a movie production are never to make a great film rather it's to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case for a books transference to film) with a list of hopelessly atomized undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they've seen greatness. As viewers & critics are apt to fall for this Oscars follow feeding the whole dumb equation. I don't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found. Moby Dick is stunningly uninvolving. Actors dutifully recite essays about Jonah Moby Dick the ocean Moby Dick Moby Dick... all things that can't respond and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest. It's dramatically inert. It doesn't build. In narrative terms Moby Dick (as a movie) is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story. After half an hour I was muttering Oh terrific... another oath ...another 4 minute soliloquy! In the failed effort to involve you it's a pretty campy overacting showcase. A lot of grey hair here. Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!) One knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else's paintings & palette or reverently embalming a classic as Huston does here. Paintings and books are nice but they're a different mediums. A movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap (Village of the Damned) is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture. This is the Eat Your Vegetables school of film-making. One appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie but not the narrative. Only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting; the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work & various sea efforts; and the technology of whaling. And that doesn't call for a two-plus hour movie. ",negative
" Absolutely horrific film. Ameteurish and it isn't funny at all. Lead character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Edits by E.T and star wars is just plain stupid. Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good think about this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities. Other than Goksal this movie is a garbage. Director Gani Mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this date. Music of Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac also have some presence. Actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever. ",negative
" It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of Russians or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that British police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. In addition Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains but far to be the Russian one. So Nicole if you really want to talk Russian kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning Russian language grammar and its pronunciation. ",negative
" I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it for while it is suppose to have a good message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation in my opinion will mislead a lot of people. In addition I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority then by all means get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the Time Machine probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future.

" Intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it. This is my second (and I assure you it will be my last) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video. As far as I am concerned this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip-off. I do not make this observation lightly  I am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life. Period. My collection boasts over 1 600 films (93% on them on DVD) and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed. I hardly own every gay movie ever made but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film. Sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise - Aimee & Jaguar It's In The Water Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally. So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right one of my favorite subjects I decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS. That film was pretty bad but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND. So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR? Plenty! To begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous. This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls (like this even makes sense). The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic follow-up or connection to the story. Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired. The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting. This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves. The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue. Hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is. It is an embarrassment to Queer culture and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it. At $9.95 this film would have been way overpriced; I understand that it's soon to be re-priced under $20 which is STILL highway robbery. I paid the original price of $29.95 and I never felt more cheated in my life. The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  I have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites and there is always one or two that praise the director / writer / actor in such a way that it's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe. How sad. How desperate. I just wish IMDb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero. If ever a film deserved it this is it. ",negative
" Words really can't describe how bad this film is. I thought Zandalee was bad but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off. This is just laughable! Terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what? I can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long. If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money (assuming that you need it!). Incidentally I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. IT IS TERRIBLE! ",negative
" I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format. Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past. And that is the disturbing point because Columbo is no ordinary detective. There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing. First I can't figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Maybe a better title would've been The Vanishing Bride or something similar. Second Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (to the viewers at least) why he does it. I don't feel betrayed just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk went back to the usual Columbo. ",negative
" **WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER** If you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama. Surprisingly enough this movie has been copied and ripped-off several times over the years although it's hard to fathom ANY filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama. Neither one of the Hemingway women can act here (although Mariel HAS improved over the years) Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney and Chris Sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking smarmy bad guy of the piece. Veteran director Lamont Johnson can't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear of a script which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations. For example the final sequence where Margaux grabs her shotgun and chases Sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead. Add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by Michel Polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure even though you're likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it. Don't say you weren't warned. ",negative
" Most would agree that the character of Wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history. I'm no Marvel expert but I did grow up with the adventures of the X-Men and definitely approved of Hugh Jackman's now widely known portrayal of the scruffy Logan. I enjoyed the first X-Men found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment. All through the three movies I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else. I figured the idea of making an origins -movie about Wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three X-Men movies. If we concentrate on one character I figured there could be a movie that achieves what I found the second movie failed at - being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure. The reason that the Wolverine-movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after The Dark Knight. It's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary - even though that certainly isn't good - no it's because the movie doesn't even seem to try. To begin with this does not qualify as good entertainment. There is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very very automatic. With no greater special effects or elements of suspense and when one event will make you predict the following five it almost feels like an Uwe Boll movie imitating an action/adventure movie concept that you've seen a dozen times before. Of course nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of Bolls**t but when everybody's talking clichés as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough. But there is an even bigger problem. Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and by the way that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities. I think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title. I mean Origins . Really? What to the people behind this movie think about that title? What do they mean?? You want to know the origins of Wolverine? He grew up with his brother. They ran away from home during dramatic circumstances. Then they went off to war. All of them! The Civil War World War I and II and Vietnam too. Why did they do this? Still unknown. Eventually the brother (Sabertooth played by Liev Shrieber) became evil. How? you ask. I don't know it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi. Yeah but why? you still ask. I just said I don't know!! The movie doesn't explain. He's evil alright! Yeah but... you know 'origins' ... Yeah well that's an origin! I mean duh! Anyway eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers. Something with the government ho-hum. Wolvie gets enough and leave his brother. For six years he's a happy lumberjack with a loved one who ends up a little defenseless around the time Sabretooth suddenly appears again. Yeaaah... but... whyyyy? - Oh shut up! - and Wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh-covered metal war animal. He goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped cue X-Men the first movie. There. That's the origin. You can also find it on the back of the DVD cover. The actual movie won't tell you anything else. With no worthwhile scenes of action no good heroes villains or characters in general (lines from my couch audience: Fat suit! Token black guy! Oh I give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie.. That is supposed to be Gambit...? mmhm yeah well... uh-huh right) not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a T-shirt with added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive...... well that sounds pretty much like a waste of time right? Fans will check this out or have already. There's no stopping that. But if you liked the X-Men movies for no other reason than that they were well-made and entertaining - see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none.

" *WARNING. THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU CARE.* Okay the basic premise of this homegrown Texas film is: College kids + spookhouse + evil magic book = scary stuff. In practice it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on. A bunch of frat boys along with assorted girlfriends & volunteers is setting up a charity haunted house. The project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character whose main purpose seems to be verbally & physically assaulting as many cast members as possible. I had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity: he's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone including his girlfriend and his buddy. Regardless the kids are visited by local character & annual pumpkin-carving champion Pumpkin Jack an elderly coot who is described as the Santa Claus of Halloween and who drops off a load of props for the house including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe-flashed prologue(where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir-fry). Needless to say some damn fool starts messing with the book and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive. There's some good stuff in this film but not much: everything is shot well and the makeup effects are decent. On the other hand the performers either underact or overact drastically; much of the plot makes little sense outside of a this happens so that can happen series; there is hardly any musical score to speak of just snatches of songs throughout the film; and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere. That last problem is the most telling: two-thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters. Tom is a nice guy dating Heidi the control freak but he used to date Jill who is now dating Dan the jerk but she's started a relationship Kira the girl who wears too many shawls/capes. Dan is a really big jerk Gary likes to play jokes and Steve & Lily like to have a lot of sex. Stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on to the point where the lesbian sex scene(calm down it's pretty tame) left me looking for the fast forward button. That leaves us with half an hour of lo-calorie scares a klunky ending and a deep-seated dislike of ol' Pumpkin Jack who I blame for the whole mess. Unless you can get this on some sort of deep-discount rental(and really have seen everything else in the store) put it back on the shelf and keep looking. ",negative
" This one is bad. A really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it. A series of crimes the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie the classic investigations.

" I am Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentary of I've ever seen of any type. You can see that the people on it are clueless. They don't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican because they are from Puerto Rican descendants but they probably know less than others who are not from there. You can see while they are talking that they are contradicting themselves. If you would like to see a real and I mean a real genuine documentary from Puerto Rico then you must see Mi Puerto Rico . That's a serious real documentary. Not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself. I thought it was suppose to be about Puerto Ricans. They keep repeating I didn't know. Well that's about the only thing they got right on this so called documentary. I hate to see such a piece of garbage being done using the name of the Island. It brings down the standards. ",negative
" I like Billy Crystal and I thought it would be fun to watch this film since I know he admired Alan King and they would be funny together. I thought I had seen all Billy's movies but couldn't remember this one and now I know why. It's so full of clichés and phony emotion; you can smell each scene coming (and going!). Billy doesn't even get to be funny very often. He's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down. Alan King himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies. But what a coincidence that Billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc. etc. Or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in LA. And when the end comes boy does it come quickly! Almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene. Mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor. ",negative
" Much of Over Her Dead Body is so painfully unfunny that I was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors. Eva Longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy and further that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing. She's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé. The fiancé is played by Paul Rudd drippy and charmless while the psychic is played by Lake Bell bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has. I felt most sorry for Bell as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work. Unfortunately she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of Titanic. Over Her Dead Body actually pi**ed me off because of its laziness and utter lack of effort. I started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this. Seriously does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough? How stupid do they really think the movie-going public is? Grade: F ",negative
" I was mad anyone made this movie. I was even more angry I lost valuable minutes of my life sitting still to watch this. I could have had a wax job and been more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. I was a bit confused at first but then I caught on and realized what was going on. By this time the film was half way through and Yes I am a procrastinator but I always want to see things through until the end. So I stuck it out I watched it all. Not only are the actors not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions they just aren't convincing. I've seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust portrayed on screen in this movie. If you like bad movies with bad acting watch this. ",negative

" Ridiculous. This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who the *bleep* Ramtha is: Ramtha is a 35 000 year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in J.Z. Knight's kitchen in Tacoma Washington in 1977. Knight claims that she is Ramtha's channel. She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood's version of Elizabethan English in a guttural husky voice. She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars ($1 000 a crack) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment and from the sales of tapes books and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). She must have hypnotic powers. Searching for self-fulfillment otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold muddy doorless maze. John Wheeler one of America's finest theoretical physicists would roll his eyes about this movie. He has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory. This movie does the same thing as those fools. There is a great review of this movie at Skeptico. I recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult's coffers. http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed one reviewer here at IMDb say to take this movie with a grain of salt. It will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbage-thinking of this movie. ",negative
" Having low expectations going in the opening new footage (clocked at over five minutes) of 'Husbands' came as a pleasant surprise. I won't say the new footage was grade A material but it provided a very solid foundation for what could have been a good all-original film. Unfortunately this was put together in 1955 during a time of one day shooting schedules. After the new footage Jules White decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'Brideless Groom' into this short making for a not-so-smooth story transition which Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end giving us the old worn-out ending of the boys (Moe & Larry in this case) getting shot in the butt. 3/10 ",negative
" Kings and Queen is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose. The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie. The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. The other story involves a young man named Ismael a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier tragic relationship. With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining Kings and Queen might have been a potent engrossing drama about modern day relationships. It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power and the performances are for the most part complex and touching. But taken as a whole the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that quite frankly it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on. Even more distressing is the fact that even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over. For instance Nora's father on his deathbed writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours. Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then again who is?) but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father. Nora could be accused of being confused indecisive a bit self-absorbed at times but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? I don't think so. Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom. But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here. This is a well acted pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.

" I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Be warned the following will not only give away the plot but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie. A computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body. What it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck develops tunnel vision his skin will turn white of the calcium after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. This virus is very intelligent. When it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head. The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water. Oh dear...

" It was probably just my DVD---but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD. I had to turn up the volume on my TV to the highest possible level in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland you might have a chance albeit a slim one. Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds including unwrapping a package footsteps even puffing on a cigarette. With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment such as a disco. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down. There is art and there is art even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort in a time of war would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity. After about a half hour I gave up having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture either.

" Before writing this review I went back and reread the reviews of others. This movie was a particular disappointment to me since it features two of my favorite dancers Gene Kelly and George Chakiris boasts a score by the often wonderous Michel LeGrand ( Wuthering Heights Ice Station Zebra The Thomas Crowne Affair ). The dancing was stilted unmotivated and unoriginal the songs forgettable the story a joke. Even the costuming was not particularly flattering. Only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit. I'm glad other people enjoyed The Young Girls of Rochefort though I most certainly did not. ",negative
" DVD has become the equivalent of the old late night double-bill circuit the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like The Border. There were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script co-written by The Wild Bunch's Walon Green Jack Nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast (Harvey Keitel Warren Oates Valerie Perrine) Tony Richardson directing (although he was pretty much a spent force by then)  but now it doesn't even turn up on TV. The material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s American Dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption with Nicholson's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife's relentless materialism until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business. Unfortunately he never really gets his hands dirty barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface. The film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and sadly the recent DVD release is a missed opportunity to restore the original nihilistic ending where Nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film's trailers. While that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low-key Nicholson's crisis of conscience is in the film it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point he's holding characters at gunpoint then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the Rio Grande while Valerie Perrine's character gets dumber on an exponential level. The villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease (and one impressive car stunt) in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely. What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring. Unfortunately Ry Cooder's beautiful title song Across the Borderline says it all much more economically. But if you want to know the film's real crime it's completely wasting the great Warren Oates in a nothing bit part. When even he can't make an impression you know something's really wrong. All in all all too easy to remember why I found this so forgettable at the time. ",negative
" The clichéd Polynesian males drink fight and make a stream of sexist stupid and unfunny remarks. Real life Polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped cardboard characters. The supposedly Samoan girl didn't look or act Samoan at all seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim. With weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script. It's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene and only two or three 'jokes'.

" Up until the last few minutes of the movie I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars. However the ending is so terrible and Hollywoodized that it completely undermines the first 80% of the movie. The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles. The Captain Gene Hackman is all for launching while his first officer Denzel Washington is in favor of confirming the launch orders first. The problem is to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub. Eventually the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. However here comes the part that just doesn't ring true. After they are back on land and go before a review board Washington and Hackman (who'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all buddy buddy! Huh?!

" Yuck! And again I say...YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And it had a naked chick on a motorcycle. This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife. There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry... ",negative
" In a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. She's institutionalized. A year later she's out has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a BIG beautiful condo in Florida. Naturally the killer pops up (for no reason) and starts killing again. Lousy slasher thriller--a textbook example of how NOT to do a low-budget horror movie. For starters large portions of this film are ENDLESS filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves having fun (more fun than the audience) getting drunk acting stupid etc etc. Also there is NO nudity in here at all. I'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but ANYTHING to liven this up would have helped. None of the deaths are really shown (you hear them) are only a little bloody and there is no gore. There's one REAL gruesome one--but that's not till the end. With a few exceptions the acting sucks. Dorie Barton is dreadful as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is lousy as Oz. Chad Allen pops up as Brad and he's TERRIBLE. Lawrence is actually very good--handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all. And Jeff Conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job. Logic lapses abound--after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex; Baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and WHAT happens to Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Dull stupid no gore no nudity--skip this one. Rated R for Graphic Violence and some Profanity. ",negative

The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts. He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller. The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a catman . Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancé ends up dead. Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not. Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed. There are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections. The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer he's the most interesting thing in this film. despite its short running time (just over an hour) I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it. As good as the talk is I just wished someone would do something. When it finally did happen in the closing minutes it was too little too late.. Take a pass. ",negative
" I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. Its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way. Gael is absolutely terrible I mean he just cannot act period. He should give up now as acting is clearly not his thing.. His co-stars are about the same caliber i'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous.. Somehow I don't think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy. I have never written a comment on IMDb but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do so. If you get the chance to see this film don't 0/10 if there was a 0 ",negative
" I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week. It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships. She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (A regular married guy with Kids)after driving her car into the back of his. After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happens at the end I was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot. The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan Lois Chiles Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere. It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me. I am not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. Overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine. ",negative
" Ouch! They don't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of C. S. Lewis's beloved novel. While the adaptation is very true to the novel the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. I've read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the BBC has ever given at the time but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the $2 that it looks like this was filmed for. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid. Better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role! Avoid this at all costs. ",negative
" The subject matter seems pretty dated today. Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe's book; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence. Four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player a young Tom Hanks enters the fantasy world too deep. His co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm. David Wallace Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game's foursome. Support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton Vera Miles Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. At this date it seems lumbering and tame. But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his Bosom Buddies salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen. The youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment. ",negative
" First of all I'd like to tell you that I'm into comics anime animation and such stuff. It is true that everyone has his own preferences but you can trust me on this movie. I'll be objective. To begin with the story - it's OK. Follows the story line of the comic books as far as I'm familiar with them. But the animation... Well it's not actually terrible but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be a lot better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more. Looks a little bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for instance - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better! In addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable the music is nothing special. So all in all - it lacks atmosphere. I watched it but I cannot tell I really enjoyed it. It just does not capture you. There's plenty of blood and violence but that does not impress me at all. May be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?) but I don't think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and spice to it. The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty and hell we have Lady Death herself! There are few sexy looks but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all - the movie isn't that bad but if you want something better take the original Heavy Metal Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards maybe. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust ",negative
" Well let me start off by saying how utterly HILARIOUS this film is I simply couldn't keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it. Don't get me wrong it IS well acted particularly by Bassinger but the script is just well the mind boggles truly. The premise is good and up until Della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill . Half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guy's head she decides to pull out a screwdriver car jack and finally a flare (as in for a sinking ship) respectively to kill her victims. Then there is the final line that I promise if it doesn't have you in stitches then I will eat my own left foot. I would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned appalling film making. Might I also suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard with the guy falling from the one foot high plank of wood gets me every time. ",negative
" Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The single real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life. Abundant emotionally powerful scenes do not go with this plot and because of bad acting they also fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to introduce Anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution. The characters do not seem to evolve although it is difficult to speak of any characters... perhaps except for Sonny. Beside him actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to they come off as self-indulging amateurs. I wonder what ruined the movie more: the superficial script throwing away all the potential of the plot or the bad acting disturbing any appeal that might be left. ",negative
" ...the first film I had to walk out on. And it was the cast and crew pre-screening (Not that I was involved I hasten to add). I made it through the first hour so I reckon I'm just qualified to comment but that was my limit. Like other comments here how did this get through any kind of QA. An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a plot. Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre almost comic. She possesses the worst Russian accent in movie history. As I left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema. They obviously couldn't sit through it again either. ",negative
" I ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews on the request of a female. Just out of curiosity I thought let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie. I am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it's a scam. As far as my opinion goes I have to ask are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded? The movie is atrocious on so many levels and I'm not even talking about the story or presentation. So these bunch of guys plus one girl (the lead actress) form a Music band; guessing from the constant presence of guitars it is supposed to be a ROCK band. Hell when did dancers started becoming the part of a Rock band??? Anyway let me accept it as the-Bollywood-version-of-a- Rock-band but amusingly enough all the scores which actually had these two guitarists doing all kinds of cool ROCK GESTURES and I am assuming they were playing the instruments the sound of the guitar was completely missing!!! I simply can't comprehend the magnitude of stupidity here.... I am just going to conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the movie. Bollywood directors seem to have no shame anymore!!!!!!!! ",negative
" Please someone stop Ben Stiller from acting in ANY movie. Write the studios hell write your local congressman even. I've gotten more laughs going to a funeral then I have watching ANY Stiller flick. Jack Black tries to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap and Christopher Walken perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation simply looks embarrassed to be there. Stiller is his unfunny self but now even with someone to bail him out proves that he is way overrated as a comic. It's no wonder why this movie tanked badly and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks. I warn you and you must warn your friends Do not watch this flick it is just awful worst then Gothika (personally i'd never thought i'd say that) worst the Plan 9 Worst the Ishtar worst then The Golden Child. Please Hollywood quit allowing Ben Stiller in your movies he's not funny he's a god awful actor and he's bringing others down with him. The following film was ranked 1 because there are no negative scores allowed so while the board says one I'll give it a Zero. ",negative
" An absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It's mind-blowing to me that this film was even made. Hip-Hop and old westerns just don't seem to mix. What target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck. Not only is the concept and plot a joke but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock. The chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke. After some research I actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith Denzel Washington Brandy Monique Kim Kardasian Jenna Jameson Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. Simply put I would rather stare at a blank TV than watch this movie again. ",negative
" This was probably the worst movie ever seriously. I could actually do better myself it wasn't even set up properly. It's like this movie had a $5 budget and left with change. Don't watch it. I didn't even get all the way through this movie had to turn it off. I've give this a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie but actually turned into a really bad comedy. Basically a bunch of girls crashed into a car broke a headlight and the owner of that car went after them. The bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off what the hell? it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well. ",negative
" THE TOY BOX (1971) BOMB Sure I like looking at nude women. While I prefer hardcore porn flicks I'll take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances. Well these aren't the right circumstances. These aren't ANY circumstances. There's supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere but I'll be damned if I can untangle it. This is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place. Bah -- if I want to see good sex scenes I'll watch the real stuff. ",negative
" Not that a film by Ulli Lommel filled me with hope but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock. But many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the mockumentary style because it never looks like anything other than video. Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer. It does not feel like watching a movie. And what's even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He ought to know better. He ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) on video. For the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business. And lucky us he wrote the script too! So you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing unjustified behavior and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied. Please please miss this film. You'll thank me later. ",negative
" First a little summary. This reporter named Torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military & government censoring him. Nice message government censorship and all that but the way they DID the movie was well let me explain. This movie is beyond description. The idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by George Romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution. The script is atrocious on its own like it was written by a sixth grader.As for special effects I understand that independent films have low budgets and some gore effects looked acceptable but if you want a scene with fire here's a tip: buy some nonflammable material have an extinguisher ready and get a fire going! Don't digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a Nintendo 64 game. The acting well let's put it this way. In my summer theater program a cold reading of the script is compared to this The Godfather. I won't even go into the inconsistencies. Find them yourself. What disturbed me the most though was when everything was finished after shooting and editing somebody might have said Okay this looks good. Let's release it. It sends a chill down my spine to even think about it to think somebody felt that this was good enough for DVD release. This isn't DVD quality. This isn't Sci-Fi channel quality. Hell this isn't even film school quality. If you were to submit this in for a project at a film school you would get an F. No not even an F more like an F-. I wouldn't be surprised if he would try to get you expelled. I felt used after I saw this thing. Blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now and I'd prefer not to think of what they're doing with it. I have been the pawn of some elaborate nefarious scheme at legalized theft and it doesn't feel good to think that I walked right into it looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 Days Later only to find a film Ed Wood would watch and say afterwards I didn't much care for this. This film is the single most terrible movie I have seen. I have not seen anything by Ed Wood but I have confidence this is worse. If you are looking for serious cinema so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache. If not I still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night. However if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then I recommend you check this out. You won't be disappointed. ",negative
" What a disgrace! I was checking this out hoping it would be an undiscovered James Garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be! The production quality was fine but the plot was undeniably lame and I can honestly say that I am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now. The movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out it will give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it was about it's about nothing and in this case it's not a good thing. We are subjected to watching one old ornery woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her. She drags him through one mess after another gets him into one embarrassing situation after another and is proud of herself the whole time. Then the movie ends. What a relief that was! Not worth the time it would take to watch it so do yourself a favor and skip this one you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is. ",negative
" If you can believe it *another* group of teens return to *another* lakeside cabin three years after *another* one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of their number. Low and behold a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask (a cheap papery one at that) turns up to waste them one by one. This mechanical 'Friday the 13th' knock off gained slight notoriety as one of the first digitally-shot features but that's where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable amateur production with sub-par performances and a recurring boom-mic intrusion. A last-second twist does little to lift the spirits and 'Memorial Day' is something best tossed in a lake and forgotten about. One for insane slasher collectors only. ",negative
" I wonder who how and more importantly why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit Broadway in many many years? He's an Academy Award winning director. Yes he won for Ghandi you moron! Jeremy Irons is an Academy winning actor do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Really? Oh what a lovely war have you forgotten? To answer your question yes! The film is a disappointment clear and simple. Not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings. Every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical. I felt nothing. But when I saw it on stage I felt everything. The film should have been cast with stars unknown newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who could dance beautifully. Well Michael Douglas was in it. True I forgot I'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like a Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical. ",negative
" This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest this past weekend The Gravedancers being the first. Gravedancers was better. I can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited. I will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end. We weren't really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying. I have to mention that there was also a bit of mis-casting with a 12-year-old boy acting as Sheriff. The only reason I sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was which turned out to not be all that interesting. Some more background about the family would have helped but they didn't really seem like a family at all to begin with. To me this film is so amateur that I couldn't even see putting it on DVD. The four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had. This was one to skip for horrorfest. ",negative
" Okay 'enjoy' is a pretty relative term but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of James Glickenhaus' calibre. McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous over the top action films I've ever seen without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos but how about making a film in the Philippines that is set in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact the only character who looks remotely Hispanic is good ol' Victor Argo as the much reviled 'El Presidente'! Oh yes we also have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of American imperialism. ",negative
" This movie had the potential to be really good considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci-fi actioner THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles. But someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one. Dolph plays a butt-kicking monk (!) who travels to New York to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years. He must battle the minion who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL. The minion naturally wants the key so it can let the antichrist out. Along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the minion-possessed bodies. If I'm making this sound entertaining forget it. The pacing is very awkward and sluggish the acting subpar at best and the fight scenes staged poorly. Dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career. The cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine-gun wielding monks at the monastery but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest. Too bad I really wanted to like this. ",negative
" This is only the second time I stopped a video/DVD part way through. I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first even though it managed to be both shallow clichéd and stupid.. AND joyless plodding and pretentious. It was like an After School Special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him... creepy and sad with voice-over narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry... and some singing and... no really the poor child's suffering... Enough already especially when it morphed into a brazen clumsy and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff. And did I mention the singing? This isn't the worst film I've ever seen but certainly the one I've felt least compelled to sit through. I don't recommend it to anyone. ",negative
" This movie is a lot like the movie Hostel except with *BAD* acting and not much suspense. The gore elements are there but you don't really feel anything for the characters making the violence not very effective. Some parts are just strange... like forcing a snake down someones throat. What's up with that? Is that supposed to be scary or gory? It's just kind of stupid. As for torture there really isn't any (except for the guy getting blow-torched in the beginning which they don't show anyway). The main bad guy keeps saying make them die slowly yet the butcher kills them all very fast. The deaths are all relatively quick. Yes I did watch the unrated version. So overall not the worst gore movie I've seen but not at all good either. You won't miss anything if you skip this one. ",negative
" Clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes Salaam-e-Ishq is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love (which is at least four tales too many in my estimation). Filmed like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings dazzling colors sexy showgirls high-stepping song-and-dance numbers dream and fantasy sequences winking character asides corny dialogue and way-over-the-top comical performances - all pretty much standard-issue stuff when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days. It's an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline. There's plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here - not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women - but he'll need the patience of Job to get him all the way through it. ",negative
" Oh my God what the hell happened here?!! I'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this? The dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in King Kong vs Godzilla Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy.Its about some villain called Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong.When he does(thats when Linda Miller gets annoying)he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes.Then Dr.Who sends the robot after him. Later when I was watching the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning.As I sat through the misery of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight.The ending has to be a really bad one because they could've shown Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again. Don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do... beware of the disappointment you will receive. ",negative
" This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system. How quick he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it. Ice Cube's character is the epitome of an instigating black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other. When Omar Epps says I need to be with my people that racist remark spoke volume. And John don't think for a minute that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the tower stairwell did not get my attention. Nice touch! ",negative
" This so-called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The plots are identical as is most of the script. I loved the book its based off of and I loved the first movie but I'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie. The pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal and...I just can't stress how bad the movie was. If you don't want to take my word for it just watch it and you'll see what I mean. If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE! Although the plot is not even as good. They took so many lines from the first movie Its hard to tell which movie you're watching. ",negative
" A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up. I'll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience. The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. Fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. Although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady the otherworldly mother. King manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case) trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.

" may contain spoilers!!!! so i watched this movie last night on LMN (Lifetime Movie Network) which is NOT known for showing quality movies. THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing as it was terrible. could this movie contain any more stereotypes? (harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor catholic family with priest sons big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family's house mexican whores bad guy who is really a softie at heart incredibly bad country accents) GAG!!!! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it. anyway the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick's beauty. i suppose pollack's and nemec's acting is okay but they have a horrid script to work with. unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents (the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang) i think that the accents were there (in supporting characters like mary margaret's date and john) and were unnecessary. they were also very very bad. i am so very tired of hollywood southern accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from. and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town: the beautiful capitol building the UT tower lit up for a winning football game etc. none of these things were there. also it takes about 5-6 hours to drive to mexico from austin. at one point in the movie michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark (during the summer and early fall it doesn't get dark in austin until 9pm or so) spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican (is there any other kind?) whores and then return to austin by dawn. while this is theoretically possible it is NOT very likely. and if anyone has started school in the hill country (usually the third week of august but may have been in september in 1960) they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they DO NOT wear their letter jackets!!!!! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90+ degrees. only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school. all in all a very bad made for tv movie experience.

" The reason the DVD releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public domain film a modest sea story at best. Distributed for television thru Allied Artists DVD's (or VHS) on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16MM television print. Films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b/w prints because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway. Striking b/w prints for television was also cheaper as it often involved quite a few prints to cover all stations running a film on a syndicated basis. ",negative
" I have recently watched this movie twice and I can't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap. I mean yes It gives a great impression of Hitler's environment and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890's WWI and the Inter-war period. What I can't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100% pure evil mad unreliable mentally unstable freak. He was after all a very thoughtful loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides no doubt about that. But why in heaven's name portray him in this way? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario leaving nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever. Yes he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War. Yes he was racist and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public? To warn us? I absolutely don't think this movie was a warning. The true danger of Hitler and the Nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness. The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive (not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization NOT the fact Hitler was such a 'weirdo'. If it would have been like the makers make us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded. A man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. 4/10 ",negative
" The Radar Men from the Moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950's serials. The special effects are pretty cheap the lunar rovers are obviously World War II surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them and the like. The acting is only so-so. It does inspire the imagination of children to whom I believe this was directed to. By today's standards it's boring cheap and bad. There's also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters. ",negative
" Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting. I watched this because: The premise sounded slightly promising: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good either. The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful: It's not. It's SO not. The amateur cinematography makes sure the fallen angels are about as sexy as the average homeless person. The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. Come to think of it Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since. But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. Everything else is a negative. Obviously the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. That's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless pacing; the way the director treats plot and characterization as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving walking and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general. This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad: If it's written and directed by the same person expect garbage. ",negative
" When i looked at this years Wrestlemania's match card i was SO stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement. It starts...and it ends. I'm sitting there angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back. I mean you watch Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then. The one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when HBK tapped out!!!! That very moment of HBK losing to JOHN CENA!!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser/poser. It almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat TRIPLE H! I couldn't watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to watch it again (luckily). I again have faith in WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the greatest i have ever seen) which was a pure classic Wrestlemania. It definitely made up for 'Mania 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as well. If you have watched ANY of the Wrestlemanias before this one like the ones that turn you into fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan) PLEASE don't watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave WWE behind. And if you DO watch it and are angry start watching it again and watch Wrestlemania 24 it is absolutely classic. ",negative
" Reviewing KAZAAM and saying it's a bad movie isn't hard at all--after all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film--saying it was among the worst films of the decade! So the fact that I say it's bad or anyone else says it's bad is certainly no surprise. It's like someone talking about WWII--practically no one says that was a GOOD thing right?! The question I have and no place on IMDb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place?! . After all it's obvious to anyone who isn't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible. But movies like ED (a baseball playing chimp) COOL AS ICE (starring the ever-popular Vanilla Ice) TROLL 2 (which doesn't even have any trolls in it) BABY GENIUSES (Einstain-like superhero babies) and PINOCCHIO IN OUTER SPACE (huh!?!) prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen! So the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright 'normal'! The film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school. Like the punk from FREE WILLY this kid is somehow 'misunderstood' (in other words a total brat) and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown. Just once I want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film! Eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him the genie Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes. But the kid doesn't believe him AND the genie's magic seems a tad rusty. Eventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real. However unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so in the meantime Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere--like his own personal servant. And according to the cliché you know that by the end of the film Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed. Oh and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fiancé (I'm gonna gag). Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes. As for Kazaam Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap...very poorly. I'm a middle-aged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well! He's an amazing basketball player and I've heard he's a nice guy--but a rapper...no way! As far as his acting goes he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him--even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things. So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard? through the first two-thirds of the movie I would have said no. Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script. However later in the film the bad becomes horrid--as Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed. And out of nowhere the plot gets really really weird--as the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star(?!?!) turns out to be an evil mobster! And oddly this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation! In addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad. I know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids' film!! What part of 'trying to kill the kid' didn't the writers not understand?!? Then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug-induced hallucination! This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLE...and boy did it make my brain hurt!! Uggghh--the horrible dialog was just too much to bear!!! Overall it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane. Yes folks with a messed up message bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film. Sadly given the idea and actors it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse!! By the way if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD try the British made for TV film Bernard and the Genie --a charming and exceptionally well-written film from start to finish.

" This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix (not I might add the US Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win) that is how far short this film falls. Now don't take this the wrong way I love B-Movies around half my collection is made of B-Movies but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is. First of the story (for a B-Movie) isn't that bad it has potential there to make a B-Movie brand were not talking Friday 13th potential but potential none the less. But what really lets this film down is the acting at not one second do I believe anything it's like watching QVC except the presenters on QVC tend to have a heavier tan. In summary I'd like to say I've seen worse films but I can't. ",negative
" The coming attractions to The Order make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage. First off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects. The acting was also nothing to be proud of but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled that right.) saved the movie in this category. For heaven's sake: DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE! ",negative
" Despite its flaws I enjoyed Cigarette Burns John Carpenter's Season One episode in the Masters of Horror series. Yes the story seemed like a cheap cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints given to it. With Pro-Life however the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There is solid directing as always from Carpenter yet there is a quality to the writing and whole production itself that gives the feeling it was made in a total and complete rush. The script isn't always clear the message fuzzy and the story is full of plot holes once you look back on them. Maybe had Carpenter re-written the script it could have been a worthwhile episode. Instead it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the slightest enjoyment in. Definitely the worst Carpenter has ever done. 2/10 ",negative
" Harsh yes but I call 'em like I see 'em. I saw this in the late 80's and it was truly one of the most awful boring films I've ever forced myself to watch. Yes the cinematography is lovely. The Czech settings are truly stunning. The political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories (e.g. _Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)) this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interesting. Sure Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow. I'm all for romance but this movie was so boring I started hoping the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. I'm sure if I'd read the book the story would have made a bit more sense. However life's too short to expend any more time on this one. ",negative
" I'm a nice guy and I like to think of myself as genre-tolerant. And I guess by that I mean I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in. If nothing else that saves me from feeling like I should be saying really nasty things about people or films which I don't like doing. The plot in this one was patently obvious the production values very low and sets uhm simplistic. The acting rose into good for a high school play territory from time to time. My feeling was this was filmed in a day -- please tell me it was. Worst of all the sex while reasonably plentiful was fairly mundane hampered by at least in my copy a sound-over that was inconsistent with the action (climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra???). There was definitely no edge to it at all--nothing distinguishing or interesting and with surprisingly quick cuts. My vote is a 1 then with the following summary statement: would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded and the rest of the movie condensed. ",negative
" When I'd seen the name of this movie I'd always thought it was a musical. Like The Harvey Girls. It's not. It's a pudding that overcooked hit the kitchen ceiling and was pried off and cobbled together. No music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable. It starts with patriarch James Woods telling the eldest of his three daughters a small child who grows to be Barbara Stanwyck that she must maintain the family name and home. We thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale. And it is for a brief time. Then it turns into the story of cold-hearted Stanwyck's fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead set against him? Well why else? As we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by Stanwyck she had once thought she could inherit some money (for her sisters as well as herself of course) by marrying. She hit on someone she took to be a country bumpkin who was in fact budding lawyer Brent. Lest anyone think the child they had a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot is -- well you know ... They had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together he was conceived. One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young who is played by Gig Young. The other sister tries to take him away. Etc. etc. It is a shrill unengaging mess -- well enough acted but without a shred of logic or plausibility. ",negative
" This movie had to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible Horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again nor will I recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First as soon as the movie began I realized what I got myself into. All they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie. The prank phone calls halloween night a psycho and one knife! Its absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie which I thought horror movies were supposed to do. As for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary. I mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of Scary Movie for example. At least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie. ",negative
" Painful to watch and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters. Two of the main characters Cynthia the mother and Monica the acknowledged daughter spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively. Their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable. It wasn't worth the wait. I wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view. ",negative
" Although the beginning suggests All Quiet on the Western Front this silly and superficial version of war falls far astray of its much better contemporary. This depicts the funnest war ever fought with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times. When we finally see some battle it is lame: An enemy plane flies over? Shoot it down (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he gets a shot off. Enemy soldiers in the woods? Not to worry they gladly surrender. Ho-hum. Tepid turgid predictable... ",negative
" After hearing raves about this movie for years I finally decided to rent it and watch. Let me start by saying that I'm glad that the rental was free from the local library. This move was slow boring unrealistic and the plot made no sense. After 2 hours I was ready to nuke that backwater Texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery. I realize that taste is subjective but believe me I just do not understand all of the hype that I have heard about this movie. Dallas provided as good a detail of the life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good. ",negative
" When you look at this now and hear all the language in here it's amazing this was rated PG but that's the 1970s rating system for you. Peter Falk spews out the Lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! Yet few people consider that offensive and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who rate them. The cast is a clue to how profane this film can be: Falk Peter Boyle Allen Garfield Warren Oates Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino aren't exactly actors you wouldn't find in The Sound Of Music. I like heist movies and a lot of films by director William Friedkin but this script doesn't deliver and it just has way too much of the Sleazy '70s feel to it visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in TV's Columbo it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films. This is far from the only case. ",negative
" Look I'm reading and reading this comments and there's a lot of it that I wanna say but I will try to make it short but clean... First of all lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made...How it didn't show anything of Notorious and I agree with the most people here saying that it was Hollywood I mean what did you expect a real life story? When will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie... Its all covered up and buried deep down. Second I'm not against neither 2pac or Biggie I love them both but 2pac and Lil Kim DID get embarrassed in this movie for sure... Next for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about BIG or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this Hollywood teenage movies. Use your mind and see though the clouds... There is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic I did not say 60% of what I have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie I can only say that it could have been a little bit I mean a much better done. But anyways I'm just some person giving her opinion....No hard feelings... Look I love hip hop and I live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live. With all do respect for 2pac and BIG like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth....Bringing the wrong message to the children and that is: not going to school but living from the streets hustling and just grabbing for the paper.... The true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence be smart and all. OK I know that many of you will think that I'm crazy but this is just my point of view. Look I am maybe wrong about something and Im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if I'm in hip hop for 17 18 years I still don't know anything bout 2pac or Biggie no matter how many articles I read or how much I support them and listen to their music...Like most of you all out there. Only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this. And for the end I just wanna say for all of ya Biggie and Tupac fans and family this two men were and will be the greatest of all time no matter how they lived their lives but PLEASE IN THE FUTURE TRY TO BE BETTER LEARN AND LOVE EACH OTHER THINK GOOD EVEN FOR THE ONES THAT Don't LIKE YOU BECAUSE AT THE END...ITS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY MONEY OR FAME U COULD GET AND HOW FAST U COULD GET TO THE TOP ITS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING YOUR SELF TO THE FULLEST AND FEEDING YOUR SOUL YOUR BODY AND MIND...BECAUSE IF U MANAGE TO DO THAT YOU WILL BE LIVING A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH!!!!

" The film released at the start of 2000 alongwith MELA both disasters So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense The film seems to suit 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000 Anywayz some classic gems from the film: Paresh Rawal I don't understand to laugh at his role or cry Reason: He goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of Anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant I remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke Urrf!!!! as a child i laughed at it that time but here? The whole film is a joke can't explain We have Anil in a dual role(One older and younger) and Rekha playing the older's wife and Raveena the youngers We also have reject Harish while Shakti playing the son of Aruna Irani who both fight on who has the worst wig Direction is outdated Music is bad Anil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort Rekha is adequate Raveena too is okay Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is okay in a cameo ",negative
" Do not see this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our collective viewing me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brains during its course. The only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer. Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. I realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion this movie has bred a deep hatred within me. I hate this movie so very very much. Some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If only it didn't take itself seriously. But it does. The plot is a warmed over version of Blade Runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. The dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg isn't even trying but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like fingernails on the soul. And whether its Juliet Landua with her off again on again British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the blustering Commissioner you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment. I recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall. ",negative
" When thinking about Captivity many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting unentertaining unsuspensful unsexy unfathomable and unwatchable. I used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of Scream but these new Saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics. They still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they're aimed at feel like they're hardcore AND hip. This movie is a load of boring crap! What the hell has happened to Larry Cohen? His name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993! Even so I was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something THIS bad! Was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did anyone not know it when they first saw him? Only someone who has never before in his or her life ever seen another movie! ",negative
" I'm sorry to say that there isn't really any way in my opinion that an Enzo would really be able to keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power to weight advantage possessed by the S7 would just be too great. The S7 has a power:weight ratio of 3.93 lbs/hp while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs/hp. The S7s low end is much better too. Sorry Ferrari fans but the Saleen just gets it done so much better. As for other parts of this film I just have to say it's so substandard as to be pathetic. The story is way too weak. The acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps. I can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem. This film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about. Its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too. I can't give the film a 1 Star rating because it didn't compel me to actually walk out of the theater. I also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal....although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of 'Variety'. ps: the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the skid row version of James Vanderbeek.

" The late 80's saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films set in gloomy penitentiary settings. Renny Harlin's superbly gritty and moody Prison got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling; it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior The Chair John Saxon's enjoyably trashy Death House the passable psycho picture Destroyer and this hideously limp'n'lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium. Your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp Alex (the hugely unappealing Nicholas Celozzi) go to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up-and-coming rock star Sammy Mitchell (blandly played by Toni Basil of Hey Micky fame). Alex's brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic US Civil War cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree thus forcing wimpy Alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter. Although slickly photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere (the film was shot on location in the dismal rusty rundown ruins of Alcatraz Island) Slaughterhouse rock nonetheless just doesn't cut it as a solid effective fright feature. This is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing. The flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more with onetime Playboy playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme Hope Marie Carlton doing an especially irritating Linnea Quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo. Dimitri Logothetis' direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy horrendously sophomoric silliness and most damagingly Ted Landon's sloppy inconsistent overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far-fetched story even remotely plausible. In other words this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn-out cinematic jail sentence. ",negative
" A killer cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. At his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave. This of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look. The two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem are back on the case. Two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. Sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish. The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film. The other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out. Now I'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible. If it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of gore but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film. It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line. The ending is extremely bad. You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. 4/10 ",negative
" There are no reasons of taking this documentary serious and there are four reasons for that: 1) The people who made this documentary (including the director and the producer) are Serbs or of Serbian origin therefore the criteria of neutrality fails. For instance they mentioned that the diaspora Croats (the so called Ustase ) played a huge part in the fall of Yugoslavia but they didn't mention that there were equal Serbian organizations as well (Cetniks)! For you who aren't that familiar with Balkan WW2 history: The Serbian so called Cetniks that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped British paratroops during the war. Well that's only half the truth. They were also a fascist (Monarch) group who collaborated with the Germans but then switched side when Hitler started losing the war. It's also ironic that they don't mention the Cetnik leader Mihajlovic in the documentary a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over Bosnia and Croatia. But they mentioned a certain Ante Pavelic...Hm...Allow me to be just a little suspicious. 2) Most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown. And I've studied this war for a long time (who is the old British lady!!! She really hasn't made her homework!) and they are not even presented by name so they could More or less be anybody maybe someone they took from the street. Who knows. 3) In The documentary they talk about Kosovo and how the Serbs have lived there for ages and therefore it should belong to Serbia (even though they are a minority). Well when they mention the Serbian dominated part of Croatia (Krajina) suddenly the Serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long. Fine but what people don't know is that the largest city in Krajina (Knin) has great historical importance for the Croatian people. It was there where one of the most celebrated Kings of Croatian history (Zvonimir) was crowned and therefore the city has a historical value for Croatia. The Serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later! But no the Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo according to the documentary. Is that fair? To me it looks like double standards of morality from the director. Plus it is said in the documentary that the Croatian constitution didn't have any laws about minority rights this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented BECAUSE of the fact that Croatia had a huge Serbian minority. 4) The film mentions a radical Croatian Paramilitarian leader called Glavas. Or the Muslim radical Oric. They accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war. Yes they were radicals but if you want to talk about radicals why not also mention the Serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as Seselj and Arkan? The flaws are so many that I just presented a few of them just so that people get an overview of the documentary. It looks like the people who made this documentary weren't well prepared and didn't have the guts to criticize the Serbs because they were afraid that their Serbian relatives would slap them or something. There aren't that many documentaries out there that are of good quality but the best so far is The death of Yugoslavia where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed (e.g. Milosevic Jovic Bulatovic Tudman Izetbegovic Karadzic etc.) and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of Yugoslavia and the war. One other thing. I saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the US gave support to a country (Bosnia) that had connections with Bin Laden during the war. Well first of all all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the Bosnian Muslims didn't have an old ethnic identity (previosly they were called Muslim Croats ) they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common: Their religion. And they took help from the Mujahedin because no one else would support them. They had to fight the 4:th largest army in Europe! They needed all the help they could get. Nationalism is the best way to unite a people during war. History has shown us that. ",negative
" I'm still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film. For content that's supposed to be so 'rebellious' and 'controversial' the things that Maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame. Students seem to be easily swayed by vague anti-authoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets. Rebel everybody. I suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm doesn't get set off. Apparently a 'huge fight up on the football fields' is a fight that consists of two people. Characters personalities seem to wildly vary at random. A football jock who Maddox was fighting (and who subsequently got a staple on the face) is all smiles and apologies the next day. The fact that it doesn't come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special. If they had cut most of the attempted pseudo-glitch soundtrack. ",negative
" I think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It does have the interesting fact of taking place in Cambodia. How many American made films of the 30's take place in Cambodia. Nevertheless the conflict there is a little hard to figure out. Even the troop movements are a little confusing. What drags it to a resounding halt is the love story. Why those two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde I don't know. I thought he should continue to use his Zombies (such as they are) and forget all about her. The movie just plods along. The perfect microcosm is where one of the principle characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept. I thought they would never get there. One guy takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue. I actually have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is insufferable. By the way a more apt title would be Revolt of the Hypnotized. ",negative
" Featured in 1955's THE COBWEB is an all star cast ranging from silent screen veteran LILLIAN GISH to Actors Studio progeny SUSAN STRASBERG. Set at an exclusive psychiatric hospital what is this movie about you wonder......high drama ? Doctor & patient relationships ? Shock therapy treatment ? No this howler is about who exactly will get to pick the draperies for a psychiatric hospital ! You think I'm kidding ? You won't believe your eyes as you're watching this unbelievable storyline that was turned into a movie ! Progressive head shrink Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants to have all of the hospital's patients involved in the design selection and execution of the needed new draperies. McIver's wife played by marble mouthed GLORIA GRAHAM wants to get her 2 cents in on this monumental task too. So does long time staffer Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI you kinda wonder if he really became this overly involved in minute detail because of his marriage to worry wart JUDY GARLAND. Talented actors like LAUREN BACALL SUSAN STRASBERG CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are wasted in this hokey story. What were they thinking ? ",negative
" I was eager to see Mr. Fix It because I'm a huge David Boreanaz fan. What I got though was a 1-1/2 hour nap. The premise seemed enjoyable: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen proprietor of a business called Mr. Fix It where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back. Among the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting. Although I've found Boreanaz delightful in his other film roles (with the exception of that Crow movie he did) this was disappointing. At times his character was interesting and others flat. The supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players. I realize it wasn't a big-budget film but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem right. My advice: watch at your own risk.

" Well I like to be honest with all the audiences that I bought it because of Kira's sex scenes but unfortunately I did not see much of them. All sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other B movies - it just doesn't look much like two people having sex. There is a tiny bit of plot toward the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa!!! how shocking!!! Why don't we nominate this movie for Oscar Award? I can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were R-rated (Mine is imported from UK rated 18). Conclusion? Put it down and walk away so yon won't end up with being a moron like me. Score: 2/10 ",negative
" I remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid and there were parts of it (many in fact) that I did not understand. I think I have seen it once as an adult and I then understood those parts. The only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all. So what kind of movie is this? Is it a kids movie ? Not hardly. It contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids. Is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children? Maybe but then why wouldn't it focus more on John Ritter's character instead of Junior? When a film has a 7-year-old as its main character in order to do well with it's audience it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate (even 8-year-olds wouldn't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them). I'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market. ",negative
" Having lived in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a Geisha is all about. Unfortunately a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture a bit closer to the broad Western audience and help demystify the country where Zen Samurai the Geisha world of Kyoto originate from. Some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings.The Geisha dances were not authentic. There was far too much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. The Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy ! Interestingly some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese persons. ",negative
" Before I go on I have to admit to being a huge Bon Jovi fan. In fact thats what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place. I probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first Vampires title so much. But this isn't half as good. Not even Jon could save this film for me. My main problem would be that it simply isn't scary. Apart from Jon's character Derek Bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn't care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman. The female vampire simply isn't scary or sexy. Rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then. Another huge problem is that everything is just too bright . There is no atmosphere or sense of dread. I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be. This film has no tension like that. The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants Berzier's cross to be able to walk in daylight. However the story has less cool bits this time. There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master - the original vampire as in the first film. You really don't care who or what this one is. There is no army of masters. Instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a Disneyland attraction then a creepy temple. So there you have it really. Lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story. A real let down for me personally. ",negative
" Nothing positive to say. Meandering nonsense huffing and puffing with a message . New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind) yet many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a dozor type of emptiness. Acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it distracts from the impotence of the actors. Special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky (would someone please realize that Blair Witch has had its 15 seconds of undeserved fame?) and takes are geared towards attention-deficit pre-teens who subside on CounterStrike and masturbation. The female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often male antihero need a diction coach (although genetics aren't bad: rather expressive eyes.) One (middle) finger for this irrelevant pile of non-art. Anyone who reviews this positively better be a (distant) cousin of the auteurs . ",negative
" The plot certainly seemed interesting enough. How can a real-life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie? Well you can watch Wonderland and find out. I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people. Unfortunately there is zero character development so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters. The pace of the direction was very tedious. This all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie. Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes's wife was a consultant on the film we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters.

" In the first 20 minutes every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director. There was the NTSB primary investigator with the tortured family life; the politically-tortured NTSB board member played by [I can kill ANY TV] Ted McGinley; the tortured father of a crash victim; and the torturing sleazy ambulance-chasing lawyer. Hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft. The crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in Iowa after it lost its hydraulics. Most of this TV plane wasn't even burned. It reminded me of the scene in Air Force One where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it's made of inch-thick steel. The show was so bad it was impossible to watch. Even my wife who is more accepting than I was commenting on technical flaws. What had me stunned was how this POS could ever get made. Are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they can't even recognize them? Somebody read this script and said: Yes I want to spend a million bucks making this real. I wish I was the guy's next appointment. I have title to a wonderful bridge in New York that I'd sell cheap. ",negative
" In 2005 George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared.The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year but the film itself was pathetic and maybe the worst one from that year.Now in 2009 the United States have another President there is another Pope new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 : The Reef which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying : getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut .This sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and uninterested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight but who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.) David Anders (Heroes and Alias) Laura Vandervoort (Smallville) Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollow and boring performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) but on this movie he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension emotion or entertainment.The characters from this movie are not only badly performed but they are also repulsive.Honestly I wanted all of them to die.The cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film but that's the same as nothing as I previously said.Avoid this crappy film at all costs.

" This movie has Richard Pryor Rosey Grier and others. It's a curious WW2 movie and serves as a statement about racism. It is worth watching to understand the fact that Movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray. Meaning this is a 70's movie not a 40's movie (WW2). Still there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a Dam. The story centers on the Captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could be from a Civil War movie and not a WW2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about. The Black Lt. gives a German women a innocent peck on the cheek and the white Capt becomes upset. I enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the Genre were interesting to me. ",negative

" This was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there. But the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie. Hanks is a great actor to be sure but lacks the smarmy morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. Putting Melanie Griffiths in for eye candy reasons is understandable but again she did not portray the depth or ambivalence so need to pull this off. This movie is a great example of how every decision even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file. ",negative
" I am a fan of the previous Best of the Best films. But this one was awful. No wonder I had such a hard time finding it. I tried 4 video rental stores until I found one with a copy of this movie.

I really miss Alex Grady Travis Brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first 2 movies. John ",negative
" The only reason I didn't score this a one is that Sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film. It is a technically adept film. That having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven. Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact. And Sibrel's irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics. I do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free. Don't let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity. ",negative
" Herbie the Volkswagen that thinks like a man is back now being driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan) a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing standing in her way is the current champion Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon) who will do anything to stop them. The original love bug wasn't that good. Even as a kid I remember not liking it very much. I had some hope for the sequel though. I mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie. Unfortunately Herbie is no better now than he was before. The film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12. It will probably entertain the kids but that's all. I realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting. There were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. Most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too. Lindsay Lohan was alright as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. He was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with. Justin Long Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special. Angela Robinson directs and she does an okay job. She tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder. In the end Herbie is a safe predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid. Everyone else is better off skipping it. Rating 4/10 ",negative
" The original Vanishing Point was a great flick. Subtle motives characters that seemed real and spontaneous.The remake was terrible. Preachy overtly obvious; it missed the point as to why the original was a classic. The black Charger was cool but even that couldn't rescue this flick. Why stick with a white Challenger? I didn't think that was the best choice back in '71. Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his Dream Quest . His Indian pal was standing next to him. Vigo was only wearing his white briefs. I'm sorry - it just looked silly - him surveying the vista in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was at the end - after the explosive crash into the bulldosers - the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph. Then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren't found because he vaporized but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! First of all you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with nobody to steer it. It would promptly roll over about 30 times. Thirdly if you hit the pavement at 180 mph you would wind up in various squishy pieces. No matter we see him at the end standing with his daughter. All in all a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence. ",negative
" When this movie was released it spawned one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews: Sphinx Stinks. It does but in a mesmerizing sort of way. The casting is silly starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough makeup in Cairo for that at least not while this film was being made. But it's rather amusing to see them try. The performances run the gamut from mummy-like (sorry the obvious observation) to over-the-top with very few stops in between. The Lesley-Anne Down character seems as though she couldn't find Egypt on a map much less expound upon its archaeological treasures. That's due at least in part to some really bad writing one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie. It's my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric such as Egyptology are ripe for silly overwritten dialogue. It doesn't disappoint and the convergence proves a double-whammy. The plot has one driving source of dramatic tension: Can this get dumber and less believable? The answer is usually YES. The location shots are beautiful and the set design is generally very good the only consistent reminders that this wasn't some low-budget production. That and the fact that there are so many well-known faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher. Cheap no; cheesy yes. ",negative
" Words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is. I wish it were so bad it's good but it's not. It's just dull lifeless and boring. It's so bad I couldn't even laugh at it. In response to other posters Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly who as a true statement on vanity cast himself as the male lead. They both look like inbreeds sister and brother. The gal Sherry Thurig is a looker. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willowy and can act. Although you can tell she's holding back. All the actors seem to be holding back especially the supporting male Mark. I've seen less wood in a rain forest but he's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep his actors from acting? Is he really that bad a director? Everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there isn't one. Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime. I know how he felt stepping in the poo it's how I felt after watching his movie. Yes I tried to get my money back from the rental store. This is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director (and if you search them out you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks). ",negative
" All this dismaying waste of film stock needs is Count Floyd popping up every sixty seconds. Somehow they got Steve Railsback Susan Anspach John Vernon and Joe Flaherty together on a set and couldn't get within five miles about eight kilometers of an actual movie. BOY does this thing suck. There isn't one original line thought shot or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close. The magical ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. The big bug - boring. If this is a scary movie Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary. Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness. Usually it's in the opening credits - Written Directed and Produced by one guy. Or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there's one and only one reason this turkey got made. Here you don't find out till the very last of the credits where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the Canadian Government is gratefully acknowledged. Right now I'm watching MST's take on Beast of Yucca Flats to get the taste out of my mouth. Ghod what an improvement. ",negative
" Despite having known people who are either great fans of Noam Chomsky or think he's a tired relic from the 1960s I really had no opinion of the man save that I knew he gained fame as a linguist although I could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with Marxist leanings. So stumbling across the DVD of the 2003 documentary Noam Chomsky: Rebel Without A Pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9-11 I decided to get it just so I could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him. While glad I got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so what's all the fuss about? For a man with so many degrees lauded as 'the most important intellectual alive' by the New York Times according to the DVD's case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking. I know I would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and I wouldn't even want to watch what a William F. Buckley could do to him. Granted the whole film was seemingly about Chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he'd say rather than being on linguistics so maybe that's the reason he came off so badly. But again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise?. Even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that Chomsky is a target for Zionist assassins. What little I knew of Chomsky before watching this film this much I knew: he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the Soviet Empire. The film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that it's difficult to separate all of the jumble. His wife Carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film. She seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life. The lone interesting thing she says is that 9/11 was a great thing for the Chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then. Not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background. It's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this 'great man' bears. Chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one. Stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by Chomsky videotaped huzzahs of Chomsky declaiming on this or that and slack-jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him. This is really poor film-making by director and editor Will Pascoe who in the DVD's Filmmaker Statement shows he's yet another uncritical acolyte of Chomsky's. Other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is Chomsky shown struggling with an answer. He seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds. Given that much of this dreck was filmed during Chomsky's lectures at McMaster University in Ontario Canada prior to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 much of what Chomsky says seems as remote as things from the Vietnam War era. Yes he makes some good points here and there on American media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals. As example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled. Similarly he claims Trilateralists run the world and that people's fear of crime is yet another cabal's result. Of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys' offices consume. He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when Castro and company were great sponsors of it in Latin America Asia and Africa until the Soviet Union fell. I can only guess that the UFO conspiracists are just waiting for Chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species-mixing impregnation centers up in Idaho. In his simpleminded world without grays Chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of Bushco whom he reviles are; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals. In short Chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually. Near this film's end he warns 'Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice ' yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn't like no matter how barbarous their crimes and anti-intellectual their posit. Please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant DVD. ",negative
" A young basketball-playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses. He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He's pressured into concluding his research because he hasn't published so the university is having trouble justifying funding him (I think). He does a trial injection on a monkey which quickly dies. He then tries it on himself. He starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy; she's the one who had been demanding results from the research. Initially he seems to have no effects from the injection except some new strength. He then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts recalling what happened. Additionally he starts to appear very unhealthy. Since the movie is named metamorphosis he does eventually change into something else. You won't believe your eyes - either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he's turned into. Incredibly there's a further change in store - the end of the movie is really really absurd. About the only thing this movie has going for it is that Laura Gemser is in it but she has a very small part. I'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover. Possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up (the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie). The copy I watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed. The novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason I would have held onto this movie; I'm definitely getting rid of it. ",negative
" Though I'd heard that Cama de Gato was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade I watched it giving it a chance; after all first-time director/producer/writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature (shot in video) for just US$ 4 000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- I can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it (then as I watched it I realized why). But whatever chances you're ready to give to Cama de Gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: it's an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence (and they're made to look like closeted gays too) made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it lasts NINETY TWO (count'em) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and it's not even funny-bad. We've all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there's gang-rape spanking murder the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially Kids and Bully ) but Clark's films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap. I don't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience's throat: Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler doesn't care a bit about technique (the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling) but he's a narcissistic control-freak: he anticipates the criticisms he's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is (I could relate to THAT). Despite his megalomaniac ambitions Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he can't even decide if he wants gritty realism (hand-held video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc). Damn he can't even decide WHERE to put his camera (there's use of subjective camera for the THREE leads)! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the director's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it. It's very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo's Blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in Carandiru Lavoura Arcaica Proibido Proibir ). Here he's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped actors in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn). The film opens and ends with real interviews with typical (?) middle-class youth -- Stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what he's trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they're middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I couldn't tell). With its dogmatic self-righteousness headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom Cama de Gato is bad for a 1 000 reasons but above all it's harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument. Cama de Gato is best unwatched unmentioned buried and forgotten. ",negative

The truth is everyone on Earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible.

" If you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you as fare as I am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes I just can't watch it anymore. It is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100.000+ years ago if you base it on battlestar galactica's timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100.000 year old Chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100.000 year old popular name brand LCD T.V. sets. It also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show there is just to much of today's stuff involved in it to not overlook I think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad. As fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as BSG was and it is a poor pre sequel to it. ",negative
" Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor but it's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well croons so effectively and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy. In his more cutesy moments (with the girl in the train station in the final number with Rosie) I couldn't take my eyes off him he was so repellent. You keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling. Vanessa Williams was the real star the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. By the way if you see a production of the stage musical the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie you'll see three versions that have more revisions (different songs same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical I've ever seen.

" Bad actors terrible script totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all. After seeing films like this you wonder why the makers bothered at all. This film has absolutely nothing to say all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films. A total waste of time. ",negative
" Instead go to the zoo buy some peanuts and feed 'em to the monkeys. Monkeys are funny. People with amnesia who don't say much just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny. Black comedy? There isn't a black person in it and there isn't one funny thing in it either. Walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack. It's labeled Unrated. I think they took out the topless scene. They may have taken out other stuff too who knows? All we know is that whatever they took out isn't there any more. The acting seemed OK to me. There's a lot of unfathomables tho. It's supposed to be a city? It's supposed to be a big lake? If it's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves why are they all wearing coats? ",negative
" I have a severe problem with this show several actually. A simple list will suffice for now I'll go into more depth later on: superficial characters a laugh-track and boring humour. If you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I didn't) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I'll summarize: Friends sucks not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new good shows (Arrested Development Dexter etc.). Friends is as much to blame for reality TV Two And A Half Men and The King Of Queens as the television executives. Now then on with the review. These characters have no soul they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why isn't Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel's enemy? Why doesn't Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility. The laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be comedy requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office Arrested Development). This leads to my next point: the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great it would be like a custody battle! So now I've provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. I have watched very little of Friends in my life but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show in my opinion completely unwatchable. If you've read this far thank you and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned. ",negative
" In the beginning and throughout the movie it was great. It was suspenseful and thrilling. Yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened. They mysteriously turned into zombies by a raven or crow? It did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore was not as good a movie as I thought that it was going to be. ",negative
" I'm sorry but I didn't like this doc very much. I can think of a million ways it could have been better. The people who made it obviously don't have much imagination. The interviews aren't very interesting and no real insight is offered. The footage isn't assembled in a very informative way either. It's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features. One thing I'll say is that Isabella Rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets. All considered this only gets a '4.' ",negative
" Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. This new film is a mess. There was one other person in the audience when I saw it and she left about an hour into it. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I've never walked out of a movie. But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they made a good film. The dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's movie and turned it into another Blue Lagoon. This is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this. ",negative
" I rented this film just to see Amber Benson though after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story.....however the first problem was that there really wasn't a story...or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense. The second problem was there was no set up for these characters...yes I got that they all went to school together but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and didn't like each other...so why did they keep getting together. Flaw number 3...the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense (especially with the typical suspense music dubbed in)...he was sadly mistaken. It was painful to watch a terrific actress like Amber Benson waste time trying to bring this back to life....my only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film. ",negative
" There was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft. All his characters in this movie were so unlikable and I could care less. The best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause I felt so damn dirty that I wasted money on this stinking load. Hey genius....triads and yakuza are from two different places learn something about Asian culture. The dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless. This DVD does prove useful I do love my new coaster. So kids don't waste your cash on this crap buy Hostel instead. ",negative
" There is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film. It was straight up trash. At the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography... and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack (burlap) of FAIL! The fighting is barely martial the acting is teetering on the edge of par and the music is not worth describing. There is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made. The decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak and did nothing but frustrate me. I think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using Yumiko Shaku. ",negative
" as an actor I really like independent films but this one is amateur at best. The boys go to Vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - palms no. And the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees. When the boys are leaving VT they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is Federal Express. Did they ship themselves Overnight in a crate? Come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur. The Christian brother is far gayer than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. The two should have switched roles. The minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible. Applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time ",negative
" In a far away Galaxy is a planet called Ceta. It's native people worship cats. But the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people up for food. This is one of the stupidest f#@k!ng ideas for a movie I've seen. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films. It's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of Limbo. How low can he go? The only losers in the scenario are US the viewer. Mr. Mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who STILL buy this crap. My Grade: F DVD Extras: Commentary by Ted Mikels; the Story behind the Making of (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes 15 seconds of Behind the scenes footage; Ted Mikels filmography; and Trailers for The Worm Eaters Girl in Gold Boots the Doll Squad Ten Violent Women (featuring nudity) Blood Orgy of the She Devils & the Corpse Grinders  ",negative
" Michael Jackson would have claimed a spot for the top-billed character in THE GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves kids. That didn't work (and why should it?) so instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by rescuing Kid Midas . I would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that's a step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does can be best liked but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent; he doesn't belong in this movie and the same went for DR. DOLITTLE! The violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic and that wouldn't have made any sense as Hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy. Speaking of visuals they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential fame. Murphy is far better at COMING TO AMERICA and 48 HRS but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste. ",negative
" This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. It's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style. It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome. Then it rewards the winner money. If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. This show has elements of several types of successful past programs. Reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea. If your not this entire series is as I say drivel dripping with gravy. It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000. It is slick & well produced so it might last a while yet. After all so do re-runs of Gilligan's Island Green Acres The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch. This just doesn't employ professional actors. The intelligence level is about the same. ",negative
" I came into this movie really wanting to line it. I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Don't get me wrong here I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane I was taking this for the B movie that it is. That said it still fell short of the expectation. The historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold. The acting in the movie was very wooden. All in all I give it 4 for a great idea but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals. Is it worth seeing? I didn't wish for my two hours back but I don't know that I'd recommend it to others. ",negative

" I saw the trailer for this film a few months prior to its release and MAN did it look scary Especially how this film was based on a real life phenomenon. I was incredibly interested and thought that this could finally be a decent horror/thriller film after years if crap. Well you know how movie trailers make a film look better than it is: maybe by showing all of the creepy parts or by overdramaticizing certain elements. The advertisements for the movie did both which lead to my ultimate disappointment. By no means is this the most disturbing movie in years . Hell I doubt it was the most disturbing movie of that week's release. This movie takes the whole based off of fact thing too far. This movie wasn't complete crap. I must admit it held my interest and Micheal Keaton was believable as a man searching for answers by supernatural means. Other than that though this film is one big cliché. After John's wife dies he learns about EVP which transmits the voices of the dead into everyday electronic appliances. He all of the sudden receives messages from his wife! My God! It's not just his wife reaching him it's other dead people. Gee imagine that. A movie about helping dead people. Come on give me a break! The clichés don't stop there. There's also the obligatory clock-stopping-at-the-same-exact-time-every-night trick and three evil spirits that menace our hero. Not only was the movie cliché it WASN'T SCARY. The film literally had two jump scenes and those two scenes are almost identical. The ending is horrible as it leaves the door WIDE OPEN for a sequel. There's also an ending message with a message saying how only 1 out of X voices heard through EVP are threatening with a nice happy tune playing. Way to break the mood you guys. Jeez! In the end if you want another forgettable horror film see White Noise. The only reasons I could possibly think anyone would watch this film for is that either that the person is a Keaton fan or that they are interested in EVP. Sure the EVP aspects may be slightly interesting but I don't like my movie concepts to be shoved down my throat and blown up in my face. This film tries to be scary original and disturbing but it's just the opposite. You know you have a lame movie when the commercials use the ghosts to talk about there film. I WILL SEE THIS FILM NO MORE.  ",negative
" I see people writing about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The acting was sub-par at best. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank what was running through a lot of people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?). I did cry in during one scene though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! I'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable... Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor outdid it in the Nothing to Do With Reality department. ",negative
" As a physics student I've become aware of many idiot professors and other so-called experts in the field. As I continue with my studies I learn more and more about real physics experiments going on and about the people who are doing things right. Then my friends tell me of this physics movie they want to see. Knowing nothing of it I'm excited hoping that the information will be presented well. I've done REAL quantum mechanics; this wasn't it. This movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can and will occur to you if you just open your eyes. Let's think about that for just a moment. Our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10^30 such subatomic particles. That is a million billion billion billion particles! The more mysterious quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% probability of cancelling each other out completely. As you add more and more particles into the mix it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result. To tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption with no rationality behind it...it's just stupid. My friend also in physics and I counted 3 facts during the course of this movie. But they were presented in the most misleading manner I've EVER SEEN. I cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie as I have not had any kind of medical training. It seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it remembering my days in biology but I cannot say. At least this film had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever they actually were) scene. Not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie but the main character goes to a wedding where she sees all different types of personalities driven by their peptides* and then the film cuts to the dance floor where we are spliced between people dancing sometimes surrounded by CG peptides and a fully CG scene filled with dancing peptides. The film at that point was trying to tell us how we're addicted to emotions so we're treated to the full song of that smash hit Addicted to Love. This scene was redeeming because anyone who could go through THAT scene and still take this movie seriously...well you are the ones that need to open your eyes.  ",negative
" The interplay between the characters is a moral disaster. You end up disliking most of the characters and you don't particularly like any of them. Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so badly written that you really don't care one bit about them. The movie has no plot no direction and no purpose. The single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers - and that's hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste. ",negative
" Well after three times through I still have no idea what this movie is about because quite honestly it failed to generate any real interest or concern. But here it goes: A bunch of too old to be teen Teen Actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980's fashions (did WE look like that too??) decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned Alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off POLTERGEIST THE EVIL DEAD and Freddy Kreuger in one fell swoop. The dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin. Good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget. Mine are usually pretty lame: Girls model space ships blowing things up with a bazooka etc. Once on the Alcatraz island they find themselves in a Slasher movie and meet up with Tony Basil who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew (complete with a smoke machine for that 1980's smoky haze infused light look which I kind of miss). And such reminded me that Ms. Basil helped choreograph David Byrne of the Talking Heads for some of his videos and performances. This of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about. It sort of happens and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the TV set off to the side. But since the film isn't really interesting you'll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time the movie will keep ending and you'll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again dammit ... *SOME* 1980's Teen Horror movies can survive such specialized viewing: Umberto Lenzi's GHOSTHOUSE CHOPPING MALL & it's Killbots the hard to ignore NIGHT OF THE CREEPS and the over-the-top SLEEPAWAY CAMP all come to mind. They are films that like them or not demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or T&A and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the TV instead of your keyboard. I am sure that HELL ISLAND (as the British version I glommed onto is titled) does indeed have some good stuff in there but frankly I don't care. And nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that doesn't inspire admiration some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it. The film is content with simpering away 80-whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance but no dice. There is some offbeat production design going on the use of lighting is striking at times and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980's Teen Horror interested. The rest of you be warned though: YOU WILL WONDER IF YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT IN 1987 and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen. Try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you aren't stuck with the damn thing: Movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days what with the world coming to an end & all ...

" I picked up this video after reading the text on the box the story seemed good and it had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching I noticed how horrible his acting was he walks and talks so stupid the whole time it's fake and not convincing. It doesn't end there almost ALL the characters act so badly it's laughable the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce (David) but the guy commits suicide early on and you don't see him again you never even know why he did it! Everything about this movie screams low quality I can't believe how such a thing gets released! I was tempted many times to stop watching in fact I did half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off came to the IMDB to check what other's thought about it I found zero comments (not surprised) so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it. The only good thing going (for me) was the high-school Rock band theme the occasional guitar playing and singing parts but that's not worth it. Very bad acting and directing... Terrible movie.

" I cringed all the way through this movie. First of all the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie. Imagine Englebert Sings Hendrix . Do not take anything about this movie to be accurate. The name Parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the Parsons legacy and his fan base. Gram's father had long since been dead in 1973 the other global characters are fictional none of this has anything to do with Grams life or death. If you are a Gram fan I advise you to not see this movie. I wish I hadn't. It's saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder. I'd swear I could hear Gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and legacy do not take anything in this movie as being representative of Gram. I cannot say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram were alive and saw this movie he would kill himself. Then again maybe he'd be afraid to if he knew this movie were to result. ",negative
" This movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it. Anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a MORON!

Being that this comment requires 10 lines of info let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie. Unintelligble. Garbage. Schitzoid. Waste of talent.

" We expected something great when we went to see this bomb. It is basically a Broadway play put on film. The music is plain terrible. There isn't one memorable song in the movie -- heard any hits from this movie? You won't because there aren't any. Some of the musical numbers go on so long that I got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when I got back! If they were good songs well -- but they suck. The pace is slow terrible character development. The lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song -- it was almost impossible to stand. This movie has NOTHING to offer anyone but die-hard Broadway enthusiasts. This is without a doubt the most over rated movie I've seen in my entire life. A complete waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this movie except Danny Glover -- who wasn't on screen enough and whose character wasn't developed enough. Rent the video and you'll agree -- this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do. ",negative
" This movie had potential but what makes it really bad is Lindsay Crouse's acting. I've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there that like her in something else but her performance in this movie is bad. Her delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. So her voice has very little inflection. I can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. She has to know somebody in the biz. Now I hate to be this mean about her but the comment has to be this long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else. However I liked where the story was going so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. But the end was disappointing as well. Maybe if her acting had been better I would have liked it. ",negative
" Not the greatest film to remember Paul Naschy by. Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I have ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came as the competition was just as bad. This film is described as adventure and horror. Forget the horror - there is none. No nudity no blood no monsters; just a Robin Hood adventure against an evil Baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be King. The main feature of the film was seeing Graciela Nilson who only made four films in two years and disappeared to our regrettable loss. Where did she go? ",negative

" I watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts. Actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities. Anyone who watched this film now probably think of Hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some Chicago gangster. I can only to say that there is much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is very much under average. I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler. ",negative
" Oh my. How can they make movies of such beauty but that are so terribly bad. I mean even Uwe Boll doesn't make crap like this. There is not even a hint of a decent story multi-layered characters or attraction. It's just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a 'movie'. I suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be annoyed by it. But then again it's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age that there's probably no one that should watch this movie at all. Take my advice and stay far far away from this movie. Your little daughter can make a better storyline and though she probably isn't able to draw pictures this pretty her tales are much more worth listening to. And please in the name of whoever you believe in do not expose your children to this piece of ****. I'll give it 2 out of 10 and that's exclusively for the graphics because the story and character development are so awful they'd deserve a negative rating. And if you decide to watch it anyways... remember that I warned you. ",negative
" I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes although it's not much cop. Britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems even less bothered perhaps unsurprisingly as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better but his screen time is fleeting and again his character is not well scripted. Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen but is given very little to do the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now). Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director and this is one of his weaker movies. ",negative
" A handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth. No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses who suddenly become the lead characters; but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff. Only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness - that's no fun! ",negative
" How low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory? ST:HF will be glad to show you. If you are used to seeing what made for a good Star Trek show do NOT watch this. The writing is hodge-podge the actors' portrayals of their characters weak and most of all the design work is downright doggy. Like watching strong captains don't look here! Like the strong Federation attitude? Forget about it here! Starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing SPIKES in their hair. While a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits Ensign Spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer. It just degrades from there. No not even uniforms match for goodness sake. They are too small or too big collars down to their chests and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mixed in with Season Three and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads! The only good thing about this show is its graphics which seem to improve a bit with each season. OK I take that back. Who uses CG that inexpertly? The designers of this show. Don't bother with it it will offend your Star Trek sense as it did mine. Not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe.

What does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm. And I'm neither puritanical nor humorless I don't try to hide from the existence of darkness and I definitely have not led a sheltered life but I am ashamed of myself. AND I'm sorry to see my British cousins dragging the subject-matter sewers the way my own tribe does. It doesn't have to be cozy but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism? ",negative
" I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason: its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and get the full story. Pros: the movie is beautiful the period is depicted well and consistently (to the best of my knowledge) and Meryl and Glenn do good jobs. Cons: This is the worst acting job I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons--I kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the terribly English way he says Transito. ) Winona Ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are OK but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that I was frustrated and angry well before the end. I'm very curious now whether this movie is typical of Bille August's work. I may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent Smilla's Sense of Snow. ",negative
" I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK. The movie was pretty terrible. All cliché no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look up the technical specs on DE 529 or any Everts class Destroyer Escort and you will see what I mean. I now its black history month in the US and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some escort work chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed. Sorry but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name calling commence I can handle it. ",negative
" Unless you're twelve this movie really isn't worth it. It's obviously a low-budget film with B actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that's not good. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I enjoy laughing at bad movies. I didn't know how bad though. It's bearable until after hour 2 then it really starts to burn. Fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wire-fighting. There's no real explanation for the transitions. It has a plot but once again it's obviously a kid's movie. It seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like Sesame Street or something. It's bearable. But much better if you're say nine. ",negative
" This film like the first one ( The Man From Snowy River ) has the same good and bad features perhaps even more so than the original. Unfortunately the bad outweighs the good. The GOOD - Magnificent scenery better than the first film. I love those high country shots in Australia. Tom Burlinson is still a likable guy as Jim Craig. Bruce Rowland did a nice job with the music too. The BAD - Once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine Jessica (Sigrid Thornton) who is a world-class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her. In this film we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father. Previously it was Kirk Douglas now replaced by the always -profane Brian Dennehy. Speaking of that it is a disgrace that a Walt Disney film would includes usages of the Lord's name in vain. That was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s. This film like the first one ",negative
" Airport '77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman Philip Stevens (James Stewart) who is flying them & a bunch of VIP's to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum also on board is Stevens daughter Julie (Kathleen Quinlan) & her son. The luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid-air the plane is hi-jacked by the co-pilot Chambers (Robert Foxworth) & his two accomplice's Banker (Monte Markham) & Wilson (Michael Pataki) who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent Chambers almost hits an oil rig in the Ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. With air in short supply water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivor's as they await help with time fast running out... Also known under the slightly different tile Airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash-hit disaster thriller Airport (1970) was directed by Jerry Jameson & while once again like it's predecessors I can't say Airport '77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons. Out of the three Airport films I have seen so far I actually liked this one the best just. It has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking & then the crashing (didn't he see the oil rig?) & sinking of the 747 (maybe the makers were trying to cross the original Airport with another popular disaster flick of the period The Poseidon Adventure (1972)) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character's dull dialogue lethargic set-pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity. While the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there's not as much urgency as I thought there should have been. Even when the Navy become involved things don't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there's just something lacking here. George Kennedy as the jinxed airline worker Joe Patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background. The home video & theatrical version of Airport '77 run 108 minutes while the US TV versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence many more scenes with George Kennedy as Patroni flashbacks to flesh out character's longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator. While I would like to see this extra footage I am not sure I could sit through a near three hour cut of Airport '77. As expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices I will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren't great either. Along with the other two Airport sequels this takes pride of place in the Razzie Award's Hall of Shame although I can think of lots of worse films than this so I reckon that's a little harsh. The action scenes are a little dull unfortunately the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as I reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly. The production values are alright if nothing spectacular. The acting isn't great two time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this one time Oscar winner James Stewart looks old & frail also one time Oscar winner Lee Grant looks drunk while Sir Christopher Lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too. Airport '77 is the most disaster orientated of the three Airport films so far & I liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly the production & bland direction doesn't help though & a film about a sunken plane just shouldn't be this boring or lethargic. Followed by The Concorde ... Airport '79 (1979). ",negative
" If you were to judge based on the movie alone the committee that gave the stage musical A Chorus Line a Pulitzer Prize and Broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for 15 years were all on heavy narcotics because one singular sensation this film certainly is NOT. What possessed anyone to think that Richard Attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a lump of clay. Not content with the original score the way it was originally written someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip. Thus we are assaulted with the Oscar-nominated(!) Surprise Surprise. Well surprise surprise the song stinks and so does the movie. Grade: D ",negative
" Pet Sematary though a nice 80's Horror movie with a nice Director and atmosphere IS a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER by Pupi Avati. It's clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas from this director (the movie Zeder was made before King wrote the book) The cat the ground everything was copied this is a case of plagiary but being Stephen Kind a famous American writer it's totally normal that he can get away with this it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of Italians movies with no -budget (and in part it's crap itself ... ) but the original idea I repeat it it's Italian director Avati Let the world know ",negative
" This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the Night Gallery show back in 1971. The episode starred Sue Lyon (of Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire respectively. The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child (which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while he goes out at night for blood. The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally. She bolts out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over. I don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes. They should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one. A total wasted effort. ",negative
" This is an amateur movie shot on video not an electrifying drama as the DVD liner notes falsely boast. I have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students. The bulk of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could have been made using a single video camera but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. The editing is extremely rough. The final edit was probably done with two cameras bouncing content back and forth instead of with a proper editor. Perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too? The English subtitles were written by someone not fluent in English e.g. Where you go now? To say the production quality is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. If you're not scared away yet this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor with lots of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta. ",negative
" Ned aKelly is such an important story to Australians but this movie is awful. It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America. Also Ned was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent...it is the worst film I have seen in a long time ",negative
" This film might have weak production values but that is also what makes it so good. The special effects are gross out and well done. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is super hot and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious as are the other members. This film is actually trying to make a point by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 4/10 Fair comedy gross out film. ",negative
" I sat through this turkey because I hadn't seen it before and because the premise sounded like it had potential. It was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving! In fact when the characters move outside the house bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops. At that point whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film. Too bad all hurricanes aren't like this one it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the Sunshine State. ",negative
" A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate 64 which bypasses the Ocean View area the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile in the past few years the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing. It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film Rollercoaster . This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to Death of Ocean View Park . As to the film itself the storyline of a supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly but somewhat typical for B-grade movies of the time. With the cast involved there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I don't believe this film was intended to be another Citizen Kane ; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; let's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise! . For the casual movie viewer this would be a see once and forget about it film (except for Diana Canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park this movie is like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk the first Harborfest and Old Dominion University. Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome. ",negative
" I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me it is. I haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point but it never does. So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans. You could probably for it show up on television. ",negative
" This is a fascinating film--especially to old movie buffs and historians (I am both). During the first half of the twentieth century sadly Black Americans were usually not allowed into White theaters. As a result theaters catering to Black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the Black experience and showing Black actors. In many cases the films were essentially similar plot-wise to standard Hollywood fare but with a much much lower budget--and usually horrid production values. You really can't fault the film makers--they just didn't have the money and resources available to the average film company. As a result they had to make due with a lot less--including an over-reliance on stock actors that were seen again and again no money for re-shooting scenes and a need to get the films done FAST! This film tried very hard to be a Black version of a Gene Autry film--starring Herb Jeffries instead. Jeffries was a light-skinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films. In each he sings a little fights a little (though VERY poorly) and loves a little--everything you need in a cowboy. Believe it or not Jeffries is STILL alive at age 96. The general plot was indiscernible from an Autry picture--complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out West! The problem is that despite its similarities the low budget shines through. Stymie (from the Li'l Rascals) flubbed a few lines but they just left it in the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film there were some odd plot holes there was no background music (leaving the film strangely quiet) and the acting was pretty awful. Now this does NOT mean that the film isn't worth seeing--only that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher. One reviewer oddly scored this film a 10! How this can be with all the problems is beyond me. However I can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems. The plot is generally pretty good the characters likable the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard AND it's a very important piece of American history. But a 10!? By the way in an odd bit of casting the very tall lean and almost white-skinned Jefferies is paired with short dumpy and exceptionally dark Mantan Moreland....as his brother!! Also Spencer Williams may be familiar to you. He played Andy on TV's Amos 'n Andy . ",negative
" This movie is awful. At the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can't get back. The twist ending is very contrived. The character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation-- with the premise that the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas Eve-- is explained away in literally ninety seconds of No we were just tricking you. Then the Rob Lowe character is not even upset about it! I will forgive you if you can forgive me is as upset as he gets. If someone took weeks to convince me I was about to die and then said No sorry just fooling you I would raise some serious hell. I don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because I might be able to save some of you out there from watching. Please save yourself and DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. ",negative
" This film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. It's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. However what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. Come on sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film well not a proper one at least. ",negative
" I can't say much about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as do the current ratings on here). I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice but I just couldn't. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever ever again. And I'm not one to trash a movie but I truly believe this was awful. It wasn't even funny in the slightest. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is so very annoying too. Overall well I think you get my point. The stars are for Walken by the way. ",negative
" Something I really love about this woman's short films was the elusiveness of theme -- especially in Living with Happiness. This film has some nice beginnings -- unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue patchy performances and very television coverage. It's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema. The ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial. But the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much. I really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't demand so much boring clarity. ",negative
" One thing that astonished me about this film (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the Rosenstrasse was one of the historians working on this film considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded. Another reviewer said that von Trotta said she never meant for Lena to bed Goebbels but in that case why did she give every impression that that was what had happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the mens' release such as the disaster that was Stalingrad or the Nazis' fear that the international press based in Berlin would find out about the protest. Also why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again? Surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history! In places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common. Overall this film failed in its aim which was to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance which is a shame because done better it could have had a major impact. ",negative
" ALL FOR LOVE ( as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend ) is a romantic period drama featuring Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon`s army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison . There`s also a storyline involving a murder . I will be honest and confess that I wasn`t too taken by the movie since I`m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but I will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it`s got a good cast that features Miranda Richardson Anna Friel Richard E Grant Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs . The costume design as you can expect is also excellent I`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at teatime . Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there`s a scene of French prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen . You really do have to worry if BBC schedulers have any type of clue as to what they`re doing ",negative
" The problems with this film are many but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. First of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and TV was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program but I believe the (at one time pre-Amelia talented)director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting travesty so perhaps the directorial talent in America has descended en masse into the cesspool.

" There are so many comments on this film yet I found them to be misleading. This a corner-cutting over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. Boy meets girl. Girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous. Boy is intrigued. You know the drill: The antagonist turns out to be a wild free spirit instead of a sociopath... Toss in a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' role from The Breakfast Club simply reeks as a lead character. And all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie. ",negative
" Well I have to say this movie was so bad that I would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work. ANd the worst part is I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city paid $10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does -- the only time I've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. Anyways the plot has potential -- it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points. And I was hoping that this would be one Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN t have to be saved and that Santa didn't need a replacdmetn but nope. The only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character. I'm sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults it's so lame that it's chore to sit through.

" DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE (1 outta 5 stars) Dreadful dreadful movie... based on the pulp magazine/paperback series by Lester Dent/Kenneth Robeson... about a super-heroic adventure hero in the '30s and his five assistants all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to combat evil. It was a pretty hokey series... but kinda fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a movie version in the '70s starring Ron (Tarzan) Ely... but I never got a chance to see it. It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I have finally seen the film I can understand why. The plot and characters are never treated seriously... it's all kind of tongue-in-cheek and campy... kind of like the old Batman TV series... only without the benefit of being funny... or having any visual flair. Corny dialogue cheesy special effects dumb stereotypes crummy action scenes and bad bad acting. Actually I find it kind of fascinating in its badness... what could they have possibly been thinking? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumoured to be starring in a modern-day remake... but I don't imagine that would have turned out to be much better. ",negative

" Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible. I wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production. Some blind dude gets some new eyes bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf. Nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is that weird little troll who helps him out and what's up with that female cop? If you really want to find out check out Eyes of the Werewolf! Not a bad idea for a movie.

" A movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself Blue Juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of this film while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal. For those who don't like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. Plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they're put in. Only Ewan Sean and Catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape which is why it was only released on videotape in the US after Ewan and Catherine reached mainstream fame.

" The Wicker Man. I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movie. The plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogether-just lame. Nicolas Cage...shame on you! I assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent. It was not. I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if it's complete-the movie was just outlandish and silly. At the end you're left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended. I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred. People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It's that bad. I heard it compared to : Glitter American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli.

After her death the YWCA calls her husband at work to give their condolences. HELLO how did they get his work number? 2. Before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet. Days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the John. Does this mean the toilet was never flushed? 3. No explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home (since she did it behind her RICH husbands back). 4.

" Koen Wouters is a flemish singer and presenter. In the early ninety's he tried his hand on movies as well. But this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all.

I actually did see this in an ( almost empty) theatre because I used to be a fan of the band of Koen Wouters Clouseau. I so regret spending money on it.

" OK first of all Steve Irwin rest in peace. You were loved by many fans. Now...this movie wasn't a movie at all. It was The Crocodile Hunter TV program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between Steve capturing or teaching us about animals. He was entertaining as an animal seeker/specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole movie idea was a big mistake. The plot was so broken it was almost non-existent. Casting was horrible. The acting wasn't even worth elementary school-level actors. The direction must be faulted as well. If you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never been to see this movie. Of course I watched it for $3 ($1.50 for me $1.50 for my son.) while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again. If you want fond memories of Steve Irwin buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve I know I wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie. Respect him: avoid this movie! ",negative
" If you want to know the real story of the Wendigo I suggest you pick up a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book. I loved the book when I read it as a kid (In Campfire Chillers by E.M. Freeman)and was so excited to see a movie based on it come out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many PC (Politically Correct) undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film. When the book was written PC didn't even exist. My suggestion is don't waste your time or money!! If you see it on the video store shelf LEAVE IT THERE. ",negative
" I've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids 14 to 22 put on the DVD of Titanic on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them had actually seen it before. But they all had seen the moment of Kate Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic started they started to get restless some of them left asking the others -- call us when the iceberg appears Over an hour and a half into the movie only the two girls who had seen the movie before were still there. They started shouting: iceberg iceberg. A stampede followed they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed emitting Ohs and far outs. So just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho for instance had a similar running time but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. In Titanic Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the supposedly creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends. The film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so what do I know? ",negative
" *Contains some spoilers* This movie is cheesy 80s horror in all its awfulness. The plot takes way too long to get off the ground never steadies itself and then just plain crashes about 40 minutes into the film. There are a few gem moments for zombie fans but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror. The zombies also take a long time to make their appearance. First there's a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs. The hero of the movie is an ex-Vietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob. The main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail. In this jail they are experimenting on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal tendencies and criminal behavior. But the badie psychotic head scientist/military guy has other plans in mind. He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make ....da da da.... super soldiers! After some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected communion wine the military/crazy scientist guy goes hey this might be a problem and gives a call to the genius scientist turned investigative journalist hot babe ultra-empowered independent woman character who of course invented the original serum. She goes to the prison to see what's going down the military guy calls in a few SWAT teams from his secure position outside the prison and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out. The hero guy and the scientist/journalist lady team up to find a cure save the warden's kids and deal with some irate prisoners both infected and not. Meanwhile the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother. The military gets ready to blow the place up and everyone inside scrambles to find a way out. There are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars. There's also a creepy decapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner. Still the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner. The main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end. The hero woman and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route. Their path leads them to a long hallway on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars. Hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through gracing their hair and faces as they pass by. There's also a few good scenes of the classic couple of zombies munching on freshly dead bodies and many zombies ripping one guy to shreds bits. Overall worth watching if you're researching the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clichés worth noting; it's practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie. But if you're new to zombie flicks and want a real scare you should look elsewhere. ",negative
