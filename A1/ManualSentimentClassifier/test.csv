 as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites. to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time. second only to the breakfast club. the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time. it's underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people. it comes on TBS maybe once a year but sometimes longer. the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes. then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious. with only a few comic scenes. in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time. i've never heard this many great songs in one movie before. there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history. the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin. hes in high school who has a couple of best friends. his two friends are sex-sarved teens. the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures. that are very funny. gary is major in love with the new girl in school. he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her. he also cheats on the side. you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much. you can feel it even more in the second half. gary's friend turns out to be a creep. but his other friend is pretty cool. the movie shows how mean people can be. you can relate to a lot of this movie. the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy. but it's so much more than that. it's a very honest movie. it's also very 80ish which i love. if you love the 80's or grew-up in the 80's rent this movie. but there may be some people that don't like the 80's but still may like this movie. i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think. it's very entertaining and very funny. it combines very touching moments with very funny moments. it's an underrated gem! i have the movie. i love it! i give the last american virgin ***1/2 out of **** ,positive
 Key West for too short a time was appointment TV for my family. I'd stop by Red Lobster and pick up a Party Tray for the night it was on. The irony of the situation was that I was working for a Fox Affiliate at the time and every one at the station was incensed at them not renewing the show. Everyone in that cast was excellent. Fisher Stevens... perfect. Who couldn't fail to identify with an everyman who dreams of being a writer in Key West? Jennifer Tilly was always remarkable (and she is one HECK of a Texas Hold'em Player). You can still find the pilot episode on YouTube. Wish they'd post the Hurricane one. That episode alone should have won an Emmy as well as the rest of the cast. ,positive
 I hope the writer director editor and composer (and let's not forget producer) read this... because their work was truly incredible on this movie. Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this movie. I am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times. Every second of this movie is touching. Every scene is classic. The acting is real. The movie is honest. You can relate to these characters as people not actors. This tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives. The story is carefully thought out and every sub-plot is intertwined and woven together culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside. Crispen Glover Daniel Roebuck Dennis Hopper and Joshua John Miller (as a 12 year old boy) give absolutely amazing real performances. I've seen this movie about 8 or more times and I still get so absorbed in their performances that I forget I am watching a movie. It's that good. Great job everyone who worked on this. Great job. The music is also wonderfully matched and haunting. With the chosen cast the carefully timed editing and pacing the mood and tone and even the subject matter the director made some of the best decisions for a movie I've ever seen. This movie is real. It's honest. It's a true movie experience which I will never forget. You may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore. Ultimately it's about people being people... and everyone can relate to that. I recommend this movie to fans of drama suspense and horror above almost every other film. ,positive
 This film IS brilliant...... without a doubt. Watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their sci-fi films (which I am not) and thought it was quite good. But after recently watching a few documentaries on outer-space etc we watched it again... and it IS good. Kevin Spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski Blown Away Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. Yeah right you think... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth. That is how the story evolves with Bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with Prot (as he is known) his own psychiatric colleagues his wife and family his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from Prot pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth!) A great film... that get's you wondering..... 8/10 Dave ,positive
 There is something about true stories that makes them so much more interesting than fiction. I guess it is the fact that truth has always been stranger than fiction. The Falcon and the Snowman tells the true story about Christopher Boyce and his buddy Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a former alter boy and intellectual trying to find an occupation that can support and entertain him. His FBI father is able to pull some strings and get his idealist son a job working in the defense department. Boyce has few responsibilities and seems to be complacent drinking and goofing around with his co-workers. However as time goes on Boyce starts to learn top secret information that causes him to doubt the morality of his government. The idealist Boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the CIA is carrying out in above all places Australia. Boyce eventually decides that he will leak some of the top secret info he is privy to to the KGB. Of course Boyce's mistake is the assumption that because the USA is doing bad things the USSR is the good guy. Over time Boyce and his drug-dealing buddy Lee (Penn) start to sell their top secret information to the KGB. What was once idealism turns into capitalism and espionage. The strength of this movie is the incredible performances by Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts off with the best intentions they will both soon find themselves in an unending downward spiral. Great direction music everything. Not only a great film but one of my all-time favorites. ,positive
 Red dust is both well acted and well made but what the movie is about i think will bore many viewers as it did to me. There was a film that was out earlier called in my Country with Sam Jackson and it was not that well received and both films were about nearly the same exact thing I do think Red dust was better because of the more interesting performances especially by future Oscar winner Chiwton Ejofor but the plot is just to lacking it starts off pretty strong but then the film hits the viewers with countless un-interesting court room sessions this could have been a great film if the writing was not so lacking. But see if for the performances. ,positive
 I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm 1940's quaintness and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious to boot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. Enter a handsome GI (played by the talented Dennis Morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy. His simple wish is to stay at the homey Inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home-cooked meals. She now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation...add to this that her fiancé is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn't help. The humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun. Throw in the character-actor nicknamed Cuddles (who fits this name completely) it becomes even more adorable. This has become my must-see movie that I snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each Christmas season. A wonderful enjoyable movie to enjoy at Christmastime or anytime! ,positive
 I find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool. I find the inauspiciously performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws D' Urville Martin broke funny. Speaking from a film directors perspective there is times I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. This film looks like fun. When other aspiring film directors ask me advice I just tell them to watch any film by Rudy Ray Moore. They always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters Woody Allen Scorsese Lucas Capra? I laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first. ,positive
 This existential thriller in Portuguese with English subtitles is a modern version of the American filmes noires of the 40s complete with a surprise twist at the end. It is riveting from beginning to end. My only criticism is its poor production values. The film looks cheaply made and it probably was so the black and white cinematography is vastly inferior to that of Godard in Vivre Sa Vie to cite another film noir of more than 30 years earlier. Most maddening of all the subtitles are often hard to read. When will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so that they can be read against a white background. I'd give this an 8 overall although with better production values it could have been higher. ,positive
 How good is this film? Apparently good enough that they plan to remake it in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville who gave us Le doulos and The Good Thief wrote and directed this film. The film is almost a silent. These are men of few words preferring to let their actions speak for them. They live by a code that governs their every move. There are some great actors in this film - Alain Delon (The Leopard) Yves Montand (Jean de Florette Let's Make Love) and Gian Maria Volonte (El Indio from A Fistful of Dollars & A Few Dollars More). The film does not shine on them; they are along for the ride that Melville has for them. Melville makes the film; they make it better. You see Melville's work in the Ocean films but they just get the idea. The can't make it work like he did. A great loss in the seventies but his work remains for our pleasure. ,positive
 I was looking in the TV Guide for movies that come from Germany and I found one called The Bunnyguards so I watched it and I laughed myself silly! I wanted the DVD but its not available here (I could order it from Germany but it doesn't have subtitles) It was played again so I taped it and watch it from time to time. Anyway I looked for info on it and found out its real name is Erkan & Stefan but I know it by its Australian title: The Bunnyguards. Some people who I know from Germany do not like Erkan & Stefan because of their accents but not being German myself I didn't notice anything. The jokes are good but some Germans might find their accents off-putting. I think this movie is funny and if the DVD had English subtitles on all the extras (having a 2 disk edition with only the feature having subtitles would be bad) I would buy it up in a snap! I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story. ,positive
 Terrific deeply moving crime thriller starring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. From the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion this cat and mouser hardly misses a beat. Johnny To again working with ace composer Arthur Wong constructs another operatic actioner that grots in the face of its contemporaries. To's images are strong and moving. His cutting combined with the extraordinary music cues is exemplary. You are in the hands of a master cinematician. The two sequences in which Andy Lau hides from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty (Ruby Wong) are testament to To's unique directorial skills. Lau Ching Wan is strong and commanding as the harassed cop while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father's death. This is superb movie-making only mildly compromised by some bad English dubbing in one scene with criminal Waise Lee. ,positive
 This is an excellent film. The aerial scenes were well-done. It was also the right balance of war and love. The film gives meaning to the phrase Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  ,positive
 I managed to see the MTV premiere of this movie last night and I needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder. Obviously this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the D as it has plenty of in-jokes for those that have seen the HBO series and has more than enough D for newer fans and the mass of soon-to-be converts. The music really shines with the new songs Kickapoo (which is much better than it sounds) Master Exploder (possibly the 3rd best song in the world) and Dude (I totally miss you) . There are a load of excellent scenes (the car chase the rock-off the meeting) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I really could go on for hours but I don't want to give the movie away. Go see it. You won't be disappointed. ,positive
 Clayton Moore made his last official appearance on screen as the Masked Man in director Lesley Selander's epic adventure The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold co-starring Jay Silverheels as his faithful Indian scout Tonto. Selander was an old hand at helming westerns during his 40 years in films and television with over a 100 westerns to his directorial credit. This fast-paced horse opera embraced a revisionist perspective in its depiction of Native Americans that had been gradually gaining acceptance since 1950 in Hollywood oaters after director Delmar Daves blazed the trail with the James Stewart western Broken Arrow. Racial intolerance figures as the primary theme in the Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald screenplay. Having written 13 episodes of The Lone Ranger television series Schaefer and Freiwald each were thoroughly familiar with the formula but they raised the stakes for this theatrical outing. Our vigilante heroes ride to the rescue of Indians who are being murdered by hooded white hombres for no apparent reason. The mystery about the identities of these assassins and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed fairly early so that you don't have to guess what is happening. Although the violence in this Selander saga appears tame by contemporary standards the fact that the Lone Ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in one scene rather than wound and that a dastardly dame slays a double-crossing accomplice by hurling a tomahawk that sinks into his back between his shoulder blades was pretty audacious. The television series never went to this length and when the Lone Ranger wielded his six-gun he shot the gun out of the villain's fist rather than blow him away. The other discrepancy here is the Indians lynch one of the raiders and torture him for information but they are never brought up on charges from abducting this henchman. Douglas Kennedy didn't have the villainous statue of Lyle Bettger who menaced the Masked Man in director Stuart Heisler's The Lone Ranger but he acquits himself well enough as a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his own henchmen without a qualm when the miscreant threatens to divulge his name and the identities of his cronies to a band of vengeful Indians. The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold opens with a recap of the masked protagonist's origins as an ambushed Texas Ranger and his transformation into the Lone Ranger with Tonto serving as his sidekick. This opening two minute refresher is an excellent way to get a series-oriented character off to a start so that everybody including non-Lone Ranger fans is on equal footing. The primary plot about a gang of ruthless white wearing hoods and callednot surprisinglythe Hooded Raiders begins with them killing Indians and stealing medallions worn around their necks. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive too late to intervene but they find a baby hidden nearby. Taking the baby and the dead Indian they ride to a nearby Spanish mission supervised by Padre Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody of The Outsider ) and turn the infant and body over to him. Initially the Padre has to assure an Indian maiden Paviva (Lisa Montell of Gaby ) that the masked man means them no harm and is their friend. Padre sends Tonto off to town to fetch the doctor Dr. James Rolfe (Dean Fredericks of Gun Fever ) and Tonto promptly runs into trouble in the form of the paunchy town lawman Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts of Giant ) who abhors Indians. Tonto tries to see the doctor who is treating prisoners in the sheriff's jail and Matthison's men start to rough him up when Rolfe intervenes and rides back to the mission. Eventually the Lone Ranger and Tonto are able to capture one of the Hooded Raiders but an Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara of Drum Beat ) and his fellow braves abduct the henchmen and take him back to their village. They stake him out and shoot arrows at him to loosen his tongue. Chief villain Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy of Hell's Crossroads ) and his cohort William (Lane Bradford of Devil's Canyon ) ride out to the village and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his captured henchman. Little does Brady know that his henchman talked. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive not long afterward and reprimand Redbird for his perfidy. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died and the Lone Ranger decides to adopt a disguise so that he can learn more. He masquerades as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and faux Southern accent. Despite its concise 83-minute running time The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold lacks neither excitement nor surprises. Selander keeps the action moving ahead at a full gallop. The dialogue is largely expository rather than memorable as Schaefer and Freiwald push the plot ahead more often than spring surprises but there is one major surprise that ties in with the good Indian theme. There is also a scene where the Lone Ranger pushes his own credo about justice available for everybody under the law at a time when Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren had embarked on the high court's landmark decisions that recognized and mitigated against the conditions surrounding racial segregation civil rights separation of church and state and police arrest procedure in the United States. One thing that differentiates The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks to the age of the Spanish conquistadors with a slight bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor. Generally Lone Ranger stories confined themselves to the 19th century without dragging in European history. No the Lone Ranger wasn't the first movie to deal with Spanish conquistadors. Robert D. Webb's The Seven Cities of Gold (1955) concerned the Spanish searching the southwest for the eponymous places but Selander's western beat Gordon Douglas' Gold of the Seven Saints (1961) to the screen. ,positive
 I am right now watching The Big Chill on DVD. One of its actors is Meg Tilly. I looked it up on IMDb which led me to reading Meg's bio which mentioned and reminded me of Meg's sister Jennifer Tilly whose filmography included Key West which was one of my wife's and my favorite shows. I then read this entire thread of reviews. Wow I really loved that show also and agree with all of the sentiments about the quirkiness and uniqueness of the characters and situations. As most everyone else I wish it was on DVD or otherwise available. The last reviewer says he watches it on reruns so I wish I knew what network channel day times it is on. So if anyone knows how we can watch episodes of Key West please let us know. ,positive
 Summer of My German Soldier was one of the many TV movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s (others were Brian's Song Sybil and Someone's Watching Me! ). It portrays a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) befriending a German POW (Bruce Davison) in WWII-era Georgia. One of the things that the movie shows is that many of the German soldiers weren't really Nazis but were just drafted. Watching the movie I got a real sense of how things must have been in the South back then; I mean can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? So I certainly recommend this movie. I believe that it's always important to show the things portrayed here. Occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full-scale masterpiece but they usually do quite well. I hope that the movie eventually comes out on DVD. Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (the My Big Fat Greek Wedding patriarch). ,positive
 Young ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere. During the course of 3 days she encounters strange happenings even a patient in her bedroom watching her yet she still stays. The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (espically by the Judge) but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The storyline is okay at best and the acting is surprisingly alright but after awhile it's gets to be a little much. But still it's fun quirky strange and original. Note: The thing inside the basement is hardly horrifying so the title is a little bananas. ,positive
 There are a few aspects to Park's movies and in particular Wallace & Gromit that I would say make them so great. The first is subtlety and observation the flagship of which is the character of Gromit. He doesn't speak he doesn't make any noise all he has are his eyes brow and body posture and with these he commands the film. Park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. The comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the subtlest of movements and it works superbly well. Watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen. Normally you'll be guided to things in the movies the screen won't be cluttered too much there won't be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action. Park seems to need to look the other way with his movies. He throws extra content at his audience there's action in the background to the side of the screen even off screen and there's just about always something in the foreground to catch your eye. His movies are about multiple viewing and discovery they're layered with jokes and ancillary action. Throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen jokes in the foreground maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action. You can imagine that for Park the movies has always been an event and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again. This is what shows in his movies and in through his most beloved characters. Then there are the bizarre and wacky inventions which Wallace make something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot everything is bizarre and off the wall yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world. You can imagine that inside Park is the mind of Wallace. There's also one more thing that make these movies so unique and that's the modelling and precise hand animation. I must admit I was concerned when I knew Dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie and I thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront. What I was scared of was Wallace & Gromit becoming CGI entities or at the smallest CGI being used to clean up the feel that the modelling brought to the movie. Not so. You can still see thumbprints and toolmarks on the characters and far from distracting from the movie this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen. So what of the movie? Well I must say that the plot twist was something I had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit. Actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller yet all the time I was laughing. Watching the movie was fascinating in various ways. To see the animation completed how wild the inventions are how Wallace is going to get into trouble and Gromit get him out where all the cross references are in the movie and where all the jokes are! I must admit afterwards talking with my friends I couldn't believe how much I had missed. There's something different in this movie than with the others there's a new level of adult humour in here and I don't mean rude jokes (although there are a couple that are just so British you can't help laughing) I mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face. The kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like Pixar. This just adds even more appeal to the movie. Okay though let me try and be a bit negative here. I didn't notice the voices in this movie you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them? Well I was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were...okay that's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot wasn't as strong and gripping as I'd expected and I found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves...again...that's not a bad thing the film was just so much rich entertainment. I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie probably the worst thing I could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive...until the final title! Really that's the worst I can say. The story is a lot of fun well set-up well written well executed. There's lot's of fantastic characters in here not just Wallace & Gromit. There's so much happening on screen so many references and jokes (check out the dresses of Lady Tottingham) cheese jokes everywhere jokes for all the family. The characters are superbly absorbing and you'll find that you've taken to them before you realise. There's just so much in this movie for everyone. There's so much I could say and write about but I know it will quickly turn into a backslapping exercise for Park and Aardman it would also just turn into a series of this bit was really funny and there's a bit when... and what I would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie to go see it and to experience the whole thing for yourselves. I will say though that the bunnies are excellent! ,positive
 Hell To Pay bills itself as the rebirth of the Classic Western... it succeeds as a Western genre movie that the entire family could see and not unlike the films baby-boomers experienced decades ago. The good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad! . Bo Svenson Stella Stevens Lee Majors Andrew Prine (excellent in this film) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all great and it's fun to see them again. James Drury really shines in this one maybe even better than his days as The Virginian. In a way Hell To Pay reminds me of those movies in the 60's where actors you know from so many shows make an appearance. If you're of a certain age Buck Taylor Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith provide a wow factor because we seldom get to see these icons these days. Hell To Pay features screen legends along with newer names in Hollywood. Most notable in the cast of newbies is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah) who I've seen lately on The Young and The Restless and Kevin Kazakoff who plays the angst-ridden Kirby a war-weary man who's torn between wanting to live and let live or stepping in to do the right thing. William Gregory Lee is excellent as Chance Kirby's mischievous and womanizing brother. Katie Keane plays Rachel Rebekah's sister a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive but giving up her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role Jeff Davis plays Mean Joe a former Confederate with a rather nasty mean streak. I think we'll be seeing more of these fine actors in the future. Hell To Pay is a fun movie with a great story to tell grab the popcorn we're headin' West!. ,positive
 What can i say about this movie that hasn't been said hundreds of times before? It's an American Classic. It has spawned dozens of imitators. Or none. Midnight Madness is one of kind. From the ridiculous opening montage/music to the Bonaventure HOtel I was hooked. Leon made us all feel so young and carefree. One question though how did he have those two hot hookers with him all the time? And how did have the time/money to arrange such an event? The cast is top notch. David Naughton is at his best here. His tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. His little brother Michael J Fox(in his first starring role) is a real brat. There is also Naughton's love interest and a dork and the obligatory black dude in a fisherman's hat on the yellow team. Michael J Fox does bad things like try and steal cups of beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and runs away to Flounder's van. Flounder's team gives us the most comedy. What exactly is the deal with the blond on that team? Is she dating Flounder? Or Melio? Or Blade? Yes the Mexican gentleman's name is blade. The other guy on the Flounder team has the best lines of the movie i won't pomp them here. The Meat Machine team is a bunch of drunks. My personal favorite is Armpit. But the silent black man is great too. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbians(two of which are 450 lb twins). You know the ending from the start. But that doesn't matter. This is the 80's me-genre at its finest. Don't rent this one BUY it. and Buy it now. ,positive
 Just before dawn is one of the best slasher films.It very realistic and atmospheric.It reminds me Tobe Hooper`s The Texas chainsaw massacre and Deliverance .Deborah Benson very good plays the heroine and director Jeff Lieberman created very creepy and dark movie. Just before dawn is beautiful photographed and soundtrack is very disturbing.I never liked slasher films or gore except with this one.Very impressive and convincing movie ( at least for me ) ,positive
 The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant Russ Duritz who has lots of money a good job nice house etc. The only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. One day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to make things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. The Kid is a nice heart-warming movie for everyone. ,positive
 John Leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller. Every time this has been on HBO I've had to stop and watch it. John tells the story of how he grew up (probably some fact and fiction) and adds hilarious stories in the midst. If you like John's comedy I would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best. ,positive
 As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres no almost-swear words like heck or darn no parents who are functional idiots and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the best kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are quite well-cast as well. I love listening to Eva Gabor's velvety voice and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit the characters so well. It's really a movie about love tolerance good manners and faithfulness. Who doesn't want their kids exposed to these values? It is a movie that I don't mind watching over and over unlike Happy Feet where I couldn't watch the whole thing even once because it was so irritating. I wish production companies would move toward making movies more like this one. ,positive
 Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman I had to see the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother. Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it. I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some-guy (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think that is great. I think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film. Natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because I haven't seen her in a bad film yet. So any movie that has Natalie Portman will no doubt be seen by me. A good film. 7/10 ,positive
 When I first saw Before Night Falls Javier Bardem had just been nominated for an Academy Award. I thought he's got it! . He didn't. I watched Mar Adentro last night. Please give it to him this time... This is an actor. Convincing touching emotional brilliant. See also Los Lunes al Sol and you will understand what I am talking about. He is an absolute chameleon and I swear it's not only the result of make-up work. This movie is so beautiful so well done the characters are so real. Congratulations to Alejandro Amenábar (how about a Best Director nomination?). I also have to mention the make-up artists. I can't think of another word but magnificent. I really hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves. As far as I am concerned it already has... ,positive
 Bears about as much resemblance to Dean Koontz's novel as Jessica Simpson does to a rocket scientist. If you've read the book I suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie. Watchers is your typical Boy meets dog dog turns out to be super-intelligent government lab experiment dog and boy are pursued by super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab and oh yeah did I mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog? movie. Corey Haim is the boy Barbara Williams is his mother Michael Ironside is one of the evil government guys and Sandy the dog is well the dog (named Furface here; Einstein in the book). The monster effects are ridiculously cheesy much of the dialogue is laughable the script rarely makes sense or is believable - a good example is Haim's character's unquestioning acceptance of the dog's intelligence as if every Fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no! Hmm it's gotta be the puppy chow right? Haim's performance is enthusiastic but shaky as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill. Ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie and this is no exception. He easily gives the best performance of the movie although I'm compelled to add that the dog (who's a pretty darn good actor himself!) comes in a close second. All in all an atrociously dumb movie and yet . . . And yet I watched it three times within a week. And yet I can't help liking it. Hey what can I say I have a taste for junk - and Michael Ironside (not that I've ever actually tasted Michael Ironside- I'm sure there are laws against that). But any movie that can make me laugh that hard (yes even unintentionally) can't be all bad. Chalk it up to a guilty pleasure a yes I know it's insultingly stupid but I like it anyway movie. It's tough for me to rate this. On a normal scale I'm forced to give it a D- but on my own personal cheese scale it gets bumped up to an A-. Yeah I know. I'm weird like that. ,positive
 Balance of Terror is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the film Enemy Below (starring Robert Mitchum) a movie that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode Captain Kirk and his crew play similar game with a Romulan vessel. This is the program that famously introduces the war-hungry Romulans who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. It is an incredibly suspenseful episode tightly constructed for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as the Romulan Captain (he will later play Spock's father Ambassador Sarek). A must-see episode! ,positive
 Even though it doesn't really matter to the film this is a Creation myth. God (a convulsing bloody figure in a chair) cuts his organs out with a straight razor and dies in His own filth. Mother Earth rises from his corpse and impregnates herself with his seed giving birth to Man. It is however highly unlikely for you to figure any of this out without reading a synopsis first and it's not especially important to the film that you do as it's more a surrealistic art-house imagery thing all in inky processed black and white. A sick bleak atmosphere is created with the stark photography and minimal sounds (mostly water dripping groans scrapes etc.) but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole. This could've been great as a short film and the God killing himself scene was excellent and extremely creepy especially being the first thing you see but it's hard to be patient when it goes on for so long and you don't even know what you're seeing for much of the time. Still a good film for the original style images atmosphere and content. ,positive
 This is one worth watching although it is sometimes cheesy it is great to see a young Sean Astin and this ends up being quite an entertaining and humorous action movie. I watched it many times when I was young and now still enjoy it when I pop the old vhs into the machine (I happen to own a copy). So sit back with this movie let reality go for a little while and you will be able to have a few good laughs and an enjoyable hour and a half. ,positive
 I usually steer clear of Film Festivals and don't enjoy slap-stick comedy but I must say that this picture was great. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz from the TV show Numbers and Lorraine Bracco Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were at their usual best. This is comedy at an incredibly high level with visual spoken and satirical interludes that kept the audience and me laughing throughout a rather deep rooted plot. Kudos to Mr. Parness for dealing with a delicate but real subject in a manner that can be enjoyed but fully absorbed by his audience at every level of intellect. The plot stays intact throughout the film and the comedic relief adds to the message without being laid on so thick as to distort. The blending of segways is done beautifully and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful. I can definitely state that this film is one that will go a long way and should be seen by audiences of all ages; the problem is real and so is the powerful impact of this production. ,positive
 I found this movie to be a simple yet wonderful comedy. This movie is purely entertaining. I can watch it time and time again and still enjoy the dialog and chemistry between the characters. I truly hope for a DVD release! ,positive
 A political satire of a comedian (Williams) who after dissing the political campaigns and presidents is forced into the running. But shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office. Man of the Year is not the funniest movie nor the best but in small doses it does work. Williams again teaming with Levinson after a hit with Good Morning Vietnam . The two seem to have a great chemistry and work off each other. I am not comparing them to Scorsese and DeNiro but you can get the picture. Although I wouldn't quite say to rush out there and see the movie in theaters I would recommend renting it. This movie is a comedy but also has a great satire please if you like movies like Scary Movie 4 this is not for you take your brain with you to see it. - *** ,positive
 Six-shooter Tunnel Sergeant Dr. Death Pinhead Cyclops and Blade help the young Andre Toulon take out Sutek's Egyption henchman in the best sequel this series has seen. Retro Puppet Master is atmospheric with many sets quality acting and some fun puppet FX. What it lacks in gore it makes up for with an interesting well-paced plot. Best Quote: Dr. Death: Don't you know my friends? Smell the sulfur see the smoke... This is easily the best Dave DeCoteau film I've seen. The actors do a more-than-credible job: Jack Donner as Azfel turns in an inspired performance and the young Toulon does well with the puppets. Oh and the ring-needle is cool. John Massari's score is a nice symphonic take on the original Puppet Master tunes by Richard Band keeping the movie playful and eerie. It's rare for a Full Moon score to actually add something to a film and this one does. Unfortunately Dave Allen didn't seem to be affordable enough for Band and Co. in the late-90's and beyond so all of the puppet action is done rod and string. There's no stop motion such as the famous and funny scene in the original where Pinhead's looking for his pinhead. And of course as with all of the Full Moon fare of this time period RPM was shot in and around Castel Studios in Bucharest so most of the bit parts were cast to Romanians: hearing their Parisian accents was a bit annoying. All in all this is probably one of the top-10 Full Moon films. It's certainly the most inventive of the Puppet Master sequels. ,positive
 So Dark The Night poses a tough challenge: It's very hard to write about it in any detail without ruining it for those who haven't yet seen it. Since it remains quite obscure that includes just about everybody. The movie will strike those familiar with its director Joseph H. Lewis' better known titles in the noir cycle  Gun Crazy The Big Combo even My Name Is Julia Ross which in its brevity it resembles  as an odd choice. For starters the bucolic French countryside serves as its setting. Steven Geray a middle-aged detective with the Surété in Paris sets out for a vacation in the village of Ste. Margot (or maybe Margaux). Quite unexpectedly he finds himself falling in love with the inkeepers' daughter (Micheline Cheirel) even though she's betrothed to a rough-hewn local farmer. But the siren song of life in Paris is hard to resist so she agrees to marry him despite the disparity in their ages which inevitably becomes the talk of the town. But on the night of their engagement party she fails to return to the inn. Soon a hunchback finds her body by the river. Her jealous jilted lover is the logical suspect but he too is found dead. Then anonymous notes threaten more deaths which come to pass. For the first time in his career the bereaved Geray finds himself stumped.... A particularly weak script all but does the movie in; it plays like bad Cornell Woolrich crossed with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. But Lewis does this creaky vehicle proud. He takes his time near the beginning but then the story  and the storytelling  gain momentum (alas just about the time the script breaks an axle). Burnett Guffey lighted and photographed the film with an intriguing leitmotif of peering out of and peeping into windows; there's also an effective score by Hugo Friedhofer who supplied aural menace to many noirs. A good deal of talent has been lavished on So Dark The Night but at the end it boils down to not much more than a gimmick  and not a very good gimmick at that. It's a one-trick pony of a movie. ,positive
 Hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film concerns about the known story of McKenna marriage(James Stewart Doris Day in the first version Leslie Banks Edna Best) along with their 11-years-old son travelling through Morocco during vacations. In a bus they know a sympathetic French person(Daniel Gelin in the old version Pierre Fresnay). While they are in Marrakech they also know a couple(Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie) and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing the dying whispers a political message.Then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and McKenna gets help to Morocco's Inspector Buchanan(Ralph Truman). This is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they're forced into action is excellently played by James Stewart and Doris Day. This exciting film displays suspense intrigue tension and interesting drama well written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett . Packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician: innocent people become caught up in a cobweb intrigue and uncanny intelligent villains. Colorful and glimmer cinematography shot in Morocco and London studios by cameraman Robert Burks though with excessive transparency for Marrakech scenes. Lavish sets by Henry Bunstead Hitchcock's usual and working until his recent death. Of course the highlights are the happenings of the famous Royal Albert Hall of London assassination where a sneering killer Reggie Nalder tries to execute while composer Bernard Herrmann is conducting orchestra. Besides at the climax Doris Day singing ¨Que sera Que sera¨ meantime her son suffering risks the song won Oscar for Ray Evans Jay Livingstone . The story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining. Rating : better than average Hitchcock's enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it. ,positive
 Containing Billy's famous humor this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker dramatic serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious a movie about lost love about relationships with father-son husband-wife about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid. The discovery of Billy Crystal's talent scout/agent character in Romania of a giant human is revealing and the behind the scene's view of movie agent is fascinating. Yet the focus remains on sensitive ties of both love and learning about one's self. Eight out of Ten Stars. ,positive
 Didn't really know what to expect from this movie-and found myself being pleasantly surprised. I picked it up because I recently stumbled across Norman Reedus and am trying to find more of the films that he's been in. I'm not big into hustler movies or con movies but I have to say this one roped me in within minutes. Probably because I couldn't quit figure out exactly who was hustling who. This movie is stylish and fast-paced with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performances. While I was impressed with most in the film I must say Dagmara Dominczyk was simply excellent. Give it a chance-it's a really fun film. ,positive
 This must be one of the funniest Danish movies ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious as they drive across Sweden. I don't know how Ulrich Thomsen does it but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way. BUT if you don't understand Danish (I am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this  I don't think it would work with subtitles. ,positive
 I must I was a little skeptical when I entered the cinema to watch OSS117 : french comedies tend to be so self-satisfied nowadays that only the most stupid ones score high at the national box-office. But I was surprised that though the humor does not always reach the level of the Monthy Pythons the many references to the French's vision of the world in the 1950 which OSS117 represents are hilarious et the director managed to recreate film-making style of that time with an astonishing fidelity. To put it short a bit of a good surprise not to mention the excellent performances from various secondary actors. And at least for once Jean Dujardin's style (which can get on many people's nerves) complies perfectly with the character he plays. ,positive
 He is very good in this role as a disaffected and bored husband a decorated air force officer who becomes bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change. One evening he meets Karen Sillas an attractive woman younger than his current wife. A relationship develops and Cole decides to take it to the next level. Not only does he have an affair he fakes his death to escape his family obligations. Lies become increasingly more of a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife (Sillas) happy and to project the image that he is a success. A fictional delusion apparently. This was also based on a true story which makes it all the more intriguing. Cole is believable and excellent in these roles. Recommended. 8/10. ,positive
 What an awesome mini-series. The original TRAFFIK completely stole me away from anything else that was on. Far more engaging than the American remake the original TRAFFIK boasts an amazing cast formed of lesser known actors to North American audiences. Juliette Binoche being the mainly recognizable actress who plays a drug addicted teenaged daughter of a government official. But it's not star power that carries this film (though I enjoyed the American version I felt it was dimmed by the famous Americans in the picture). Unfortunately I saw the American version before I found the original BBC mini-series. Of course there were no picture filters lush locales and the big name stars/director. However the grit and grime of Europe (through the drugworld) perfectly compliments the impending sense of danger which permeates throughout this film. The problems such as getting addicts off of drugs by giving them more poor anti-drug campaigning and the resistance of foreign governments to assist with destroying their drug cultivators from within all make TRAFFIK bold immersive and horrific all at the same time! The truly incredible portions of the movie all come from Pakistan. My God I never knew how bad the problem really was over in Europe...even all over! For a real education on the problems of drugs beyond how they affect the human body you must watch both this and the American version. Each show one very clear and undeniable fact. Those countries which are leaders in the eyes of the world have a culture that has led to the death and suffering for many. Drugs are worse than war. They work in the shadows the dark secrets of any successful society. ,positive
 Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel set in 1924 concerns the partitioning of Ireland in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder half the village is now in Northern Ireland the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. A dead man has to have a passport made out in his name before villagers can reach the churchyard to bury him. 'Puckoon' is a sort of Irish 'Under Milk Wood' with comic characters and surreal happenings galore. The lead character Dan Milligan ( renamed 'Madigan' in the film ) is impishly played by Sean Hughes and has conversations with the narrator ( Richard Attenborough ). Also in the film is Milo O'Shea Griff Rhys Jones David Kelly ( from 'Robin's Nest' ) Freddie Jones Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. Interviewed for the 'Making of 'Puckoon' documentary writer/director Terence Ryan expressed undying admiration for the book. It shows on screen. But alas like the ill-fated film of 'The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy' a good book does not necessarily make a good film. The trouble with 'Puckoon' is that like Milligan's other books they simply do not work on the big screen. 'Puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot. No way can the film be compared to train wrecks like 'Sex Lives Of The Potato Men' 'Fat Slags' and 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' but then neither is it as good as it should have been. The last half-hour involves a lot of running around by the police the British army some locals who have stashed explosives in a coffin and is really tedious to sit through. Ryan's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film. The other problem is the total absence of charm. 'Waking Ned' had this in spades while the 'Father Ted' television series was funnier by far. Spike lived long enough to see the film and apparently enjoyed it. His daughter Jane has a cameo as Madigan's bride. The highlight for me though was the quotation at the beginning: I don't mind dying! said Spike: I just don't want to be there when it happens! . ,positive
 Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema. From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov based on his own play Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home. Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us straight from a soldier's mouth how war is hated by all that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting we see a new vision of WWII. We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don't believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East and how people are dying for no reason against their will it's nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are as well as those awaiting their return. Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration. Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude. Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not I don't know. There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country it is all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday. The acting is top-notch throughout but some deserve singling out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris' grandmother. She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich brings what is perhaps the best performance. As spoken at the end about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments. He puts on a tough exterior especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave. But when Boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man seated in sorrow at the table. He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him his actions throughout the film express it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris a happy-go-lucky young man and idealist doing what he believes is right and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark staying home due to his talented piano skills or maybe just to steal his cousin's love. That love played by Tatyana Samojlova really draws the audience in to her grief dejection and slim glimmer of hope. The true star of the film she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way needing to steer back on course hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris' return. Besides the realism to the story as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen. It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame. Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water a bridge in the background at the top as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance. There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are utilized as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together. The real feats however are those instances of the long shot. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris her own farewell needing to be said. The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people the camera focuses on couples kisses people yelling to one another and more all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through. Everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en scène can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible. Composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do. ,positive
 This show is non Stop hilarity. the first joke will make u wet your pants. And thats probably the weakest joke of them all. I started watching it when the second half of season 2 started airing. and straight away. I'm hooked. only 2 weeks after I started watching. I've downloaded episodes and bought the DVD's. Reoccurring Clips Such as the Ad Road Test and current affairs Are quiet hilarious. Then There's the ad's they take off Use Emo. Use your Own Tears For More Effective Use Also Funny in the politics Side of things. Nothing is wrong with them doing this. it's funny. Any Australians Who Don't Find This Funny. Don't Complain And don't Watch it. ALL Australian TUNE IN Wednesday AT 9 ON ABC ,positive
 Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through but how well was the emotional stuff handled? It would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off. The image of the ex female cyberman making crying noises as she/it saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. That's twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically the previous being the last Dalek from series one but by Jove it's worked. Add to that the other ex-female who had been upgraded on the eve of her wedding and Jackie Tyler recognising her husband after she had become cyber and you have a permanent throat lump. Keep it up! ,positive
 The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film as the series followed a very similar format. As usual Simon Templar ( The Saint ) meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are) Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool! George Sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated British do-gooder and he succeeds once again in making an excellent B-detective series film. Nothing particularly special but a familiar and breezy product sure to please fans of the genre. ,positive
 Excellent story with supperb acting by all of the cast. The warmth and insight into who Joad represents moved off of the screen and into the heart of this viewer. The frustration's and tenacity of Mother Madalyn in her quest to do HIS work till her last breath was also done with excellance by Barbara Hershey. The intertwining of the personalities of Joad and Mother Madalyn grew throughout the story line with a breath taking crescendo in the final scene. ,positive
 This was a random rental at the video store. But I was impressed from the start. Wooden Camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director. The film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid South Africa. The young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clichés. The musical score to the film adds body to the film without being obtrusive. After watching it the second time I tracked down the DVD on amazon and have been happy ever since. ,positive
 Even though I saw this film when I was very young I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd who famously escaped from Newgate prison. Apart from the liberty taken right at the end the film more or less faithfully follows the true story. The temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so-called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that. Of the performances There is scarcely a poor performance and Tommy Steele is ideally cast. Also good is Stanley Baker as the Thief-Taker and Alan Badel is good as always. Because the film sticks to the facts it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family. ,positive
 I must admit I liked this movie and didnt find it all misogynist. It could be subtitled three ways of looking at LiV Tyler. Three different men become obsessed with the same woman and tell their stories to very different characters;One man(John Goodman) tells his story to a priest(the very funny Richard Jenkins).For Goodmans charcter the Liv Tyler character is an idealized saint the second coming of his sainted wife Theresa.For Paul Riesers character(who tellls story to a shrink(a fine understated performance by the great Reba Mcintire) the Liv Tyler character is simplyan object of (kinky)sexual fantasy.Finally Matt Dillons rather dimwitted charcter tells HIS side of the story to a sleazy hit man played by Micheal Douglas.All three of these narratives of obsession are told simultaneously and all are amusing. Finaly the film ends in a bizarrely funny climax that I wont give away. ,positive
 I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one. Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. He would probably say it was easy but he really does a great job and should have won something for it. We've had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over and the humor is adult enough that I don't mind having to hear it in the background (and I do run to the TV for the really funny parts). Simple moral message lots of decent action and slapstick bad grownups acting goofy to take the edge off minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard. ,positive
 I first saw this film two years ago in the cinema and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step-mother. Their relationship with their step-mother is strained to say the least with the step-mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls. The film though slants with Oriental style ghost effects and horror which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear but is all the more intriguing. The direction is incredibly good and the acting is stunning with the step-mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film. The large house adds eeriness and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat. This film to me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment. You simply don't get anything like this in the Western World sadly and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade. Highly recommended viewing in my opinion a real joy and scare... ,positive
 As a Canadian I didn't know very much about the Whitlam dismissal. I had read the Wikipedia page about those events but that was about it. Earlier this year when Canada went through a potential constitutional crisis (it fizzled out thankfully) that might have led to intervention by our Governor-General the Whitlam dismissal was mentioned in the press. In an effort to learn more I ordered the DVD of this mini-series through EBay. I was greatly impressed by how interesting the account was. As dramatic as events were this could have been a very boring political drama. However it was a pretty suspenseful mini-series. I was also impressed by how understandable it was despite my lack of familiarity with Australian politics. It didn't take long to figure out who everyone was and what their roles were. Having said that it is not an entirely impartial account. Malcolm Fraser is certainly portrayed as a rather Machiavellian figure who lets no person or thing get in the way of his quest to be Prime Minister. Gough Whitlam is portrayed in a more noble almost saintly light. However the actor portraying Whitlam channels the nobility in such a way that it comes across more as pomposity. I thought that Sir John Kerr was portrayed in a fairly sympathetic manner. I must warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. I understand that it was made for television in the early 80s but it would appear that no effort was made to restore the picture quality or sound quality. It was very disappointing that no extras were added either. A documentary or even some interviews with the historical figures would have enhanced the experience but there is nothing. I highly recommend this mini-series for anyone interested in the real-life events. ,positive
 I don't know what it is exactly but the film is happily sitting on my shelf with no thought of ever leaving me...Fulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous bizzare cheez-infested and well unique movies I've ever seen. Not sure what else to say about it but I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! The steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious...I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do but has anyone heard that based on this film Fulci accused Wes Craven of ripping him off with Scream ? Cat in the Brain is a must for bad movie lovers everywhere...Yes I'll definitely say it's not a good film but I guarantee certain scenes will stick in your mind forever! This is an exercise in craziness people...I guess if I were a serious critic I'd give it a 3 but on sheer enjoyability (again I can't really explain my affections) I'd give it a 7....Really whacked out flick... ,positive
 I heard that after the first Oceans movie the sequels begin to go downhill. I believe that this is not the case(at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first film! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos. Now Benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. To do that they must do a couple heists in Europe to get the money. The acting is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations. Matt Damon Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this film. There are some confusing moments in this film. But that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments. Anyway this movie is only made for harmless fun. Overall this is a great heist movie. I rate this movie 9/10. ,positive
 The creative team that brought us Police Squad - and the Naked Gun derived from it - said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after their delivery of the first episode. Basically the show was never given any chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that for the show to be funny the viewer would actually need to watch it; most shows are presented on TV with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food or going to the toilet etc. The humor of the show is extremely dry (it uses no laugh-track) and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen regardless of logic as long as it was totally unbelievable; so for instance in one episode a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgery. Those familiar with the Naked Gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films. In the films Nielsen developed a particular take approach - that is eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected. This doesn't happen in the show where Nielsen's Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected to him. Also there are no romances in the show and no parodies of MTV. Finally the show takes certain risks that the films avoid; in the first episode Drebin to re-enact the crime has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles - ballistics the hard way. This is actually a risky bit of humor since we need to accept that it's perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime for no other reason than experimentation. This sort of thing rarely happens in the films. Taken individually each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the Naked Gun films since they are both more compact (more happens in a shorter time-frame) yet more leisurely paced (there's not the rush for a punch-line as sometimes happens in the films). There are some inconsistencies that happen in the films (primarily 2 and 3 ) that never occur in the show's shorter time-frame. Of course there's no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema. And if you watch the TV show episode after episode in one sitting the dry quality of the humor might wear away one's tolerance. None the less it would be useful to have a DVD of this and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - If laughter has as some claim medicinal value watching this show is good for one's health. ,positive
 While Disney have been THE animation studio for the past 70 years there have always been rivals to their supremacy. When this review was written in 2009 for example companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the Disney dominance. Back in the beginning in that late '30s and early '40s heyday when Disney was serving cinematic banquets like Snow White Dumbo and Fantasia the competition was provided by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite releasing two very commendable films they never quite cornered the market  many attribute their downfall to the commercial failure of Mr Bug Goes To Town released the same week as the attack on Pearl Harbour (which gave the American public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon!) That this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travesty. In a patch of overgrown garden in the city a bunch of bugs are in dire danger. Humans use the land as a shortcut discarding litter and cigars and other hazards right on top of the bugs' homes as they go. Honey-shop owner Mr Bumble (voiced by Jack Mercer) fears that the future is bleak and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter Honey (voiced by Pauline Loth) in more secure surroundings. A highly unscrupulous creature Bagley C. Beetle (voiced by Tedd Pierce) offers to provide her a safer place to live if she will accept his hand in marriage but Honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart the perennially cheerful and optimistic Hoppity (voiced by Stan Freed). Hoppity believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better but is left looking foolish when Bagley Beetle and his pair of comical sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devious end. Only at the very end as their patch becomes the foundation for a huge new skyscraper do the bugs switch loyalty back to Hoppity as they look to him to lead them a new safe home away from the destructive influence of humans. What really works in this film is the delightful characterisation  all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal. The bumbling villains Swat the fly and Smack the mosquito (hilarious names if you stop to think about it) are particularly memorable. Equally admirable is the storytelling drive  even the youngest of children can enjoy this story while at the same time it skillfully conveys a message for older audiences about the way human carelessness can impact upon the survival of wildlife. Time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film and when viewing it the audience needs to accept (and forgive) these occasional signs of general age and wear. But on the whole Mr Bug Goes To Town is an accomplished funny and very slickly presented animation with a worthy message to boot. ,positive
 This is what James Cagney is all about wisecracks cockiness hard as nails and no-nonsense charisma. Although the plot sounds serious the film is anything but. It is done in the 30's screwball comedy style and works well with his 'bickering' with fiancé Mae Clark and his reactions to the tall stories of his colleague James Burke. What raises it above normal is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it. Dialogue is good but it is nothing unless delivery is spot on and can bounce about the characters involved. This is done well by all throughout. Good entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable. ,positive
 Hoppity is a charming if slightly phycadelic animated movie that considering it was made in the 1941 has stood the test of time incredibly well. Now I have to admit I have a soft spot for 'HoppityGoes To Town' (as it is called in the United Kingdom) having watched a VHS version taped of the TV by our parents many times with my siblings.Imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning just in time to catch it on Channel Four (at 0615 never the less!) The film was just as delightful as I remembered it with the animation standing the test of time and a lovely moral tale which should appeal to parents and children alike. Maybe one day I to shall share this forgotten classic with children of my own. With a nice running time for kids (88 Min's)and a simple yet involving storyline there really is something for everyone in this tale of the little guy coming good. I really could see this being successfully remade in CGI. Take note Pixar. ,positive
 A great movie about triumph over all the nay-sayers who try to kill your spirit achieving the impossible. I won't go on about it other than to say that I liked to reflect on the this film when I'm facing something particularly daunting and realize that if Lindberg could do what he did I can certainly face the task before me. Definitely a feel good movie. See it. You won't be disappointed. ,positive
 Overall the Dad's Army movie is very funny although the humour isn't quite as catchy and sparkly as in the TV and radio series. So where does this leave us the viewers? If you've never seen Dad's Army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting hooked on the mad world of Walmington o/S. The downside is that you might not get it because as I said the humour in the movie is a bit on the stolid side. For Dad's Army buffs the movie holds nothing new as the story is more or less a cutup of the TV series but it's a unique chance of seeing your favourites in high def as compared to the shitty quality of the BBC video recordings. The movie also features what must be the lamest holdup sequence in the history of the universe. I can't make up my mind if that's a positive or a negative though. ,positive
 I must warn you there are some spoilers in it. But to start it off I got Spanish Judges on February I think. It was mention it was the last copy but as I see it wasn't back-ordered. But either way I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. Man what a good actor. The story it about a con artist known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who claims to have merchandises called The Spanish Judges. If you don't know what Spanish Judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read I won't even say what they are. I figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. He needs protection so he hires a couple who are also crooks Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from Mars as she said. So they (mainly Jack) call her Mars Girl . Everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game. A game that involves some lust lies and betrayal. There was some over acting in it (Matt and Valeria as well as Tamara were not one of them). There were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well. Some of the score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice that's my opinion. The fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Damn he plays a smooth slick con man. I know this is a review but I need to make a correction towards NeCRo one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site she has been acting since 1983. To me and hopefully to others she is well known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both the Hot Shots! movies. But good review. Although I think it's one of the rare films I've seen and it's really good (which is why I gave it 10 stars above) I will give the grade of what I thought when I first saw it. 8/10 ,positive
 A rather silly little film you just may love. Although rather corny and cliché at times it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun. Five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest - just for the sheer joy knowing yours is the best team. Notable for several screen debuts including David Naughton's first film role after his Dr. Pepper Be a Pepper commercials and before his major 1981 hit American Werewolf in London . Also features Paul Ruebens in what I believe is his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire roll a year before he became known for it. And last but not least Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton himself Michael J. Fox gets his first film role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House. Outside of that no names but all funny characters. Doubt it has ever made it to DVD but there are still probably some VHS copies floating around and you might even catch on a late late show sometime. If you do is worth your watch. You may hate it but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love. ,positive
 Nightbreed blew my mind the first time I saw it. And it's held up quite well over the years. The sets and monster effects work are some of the best I've ever seen. Nobody I know seems to have seen this film which I believe tanked at the box office because of the lack of interest in horror in the early nineties. It plays like a dark horrific fairy tale and is a lot deeper then you'd think with a strong message against bigotry presented by a rich mystical past that Clive Barker created. What sucks is the film ends on a really cool sequel note that we'll probably never see. My only minor gripe is that Craig Sheffer is only a passable actor at best and the the project might have benefited with a better actor in the part. Just a minor complaint though as Sheffer does alright. I had a similar issue with Scott Bakula in Barker's Lord Of Illusions not really a terrible performance but I just didn't like him in the role as much as I would have other people. ,positive
 I remember watching this movie when it came out as a t.v. movie of the week in the early 1970's. Although I haven't seen this movie in over 30 years I remember how creepy it was...the sister's dead body in the basement the storm raging outside the creepy house with no electricity and a killer still on the premises. They just don't make t.v. movies like this one anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress and I liked her in not only Betwitched but several of her post-Bewitched roles such as this one and 1975's The Legend of Lizzie Borden . I really wish that someone would come out with a DVD that has several of the 1970's t.v. movie of the week on one DVD. Wouldn't it be awesome to watch When Michael Calls Bad Ronald Don't Be Afraid of the Dark Crowhaven Farm etc. all on one DVD? I know there is a market for a DVD like this for all of us baby boomers who grew up in the 1960's and 1970's. Maybe if we are lucky someday someone will offer us a DVD with a great selection of t.v. movies like this. ,positive
 Hoot is a nice young person's film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a pancake house chain from bulldozing a plot of land that is home to some endangered burrowing owls. The acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see. Many well known comedians are in this film and keep the humor going almost nonstop. It is a film for the young crowd perhaps 5 to 11 years of age. I thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days. There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids. It's just a bunch of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over developed. If you can remember back to the day when you weren't fight for a buck you may remember that money isn't everything. Not many people over 12 are going to enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the old after school special series. ,positive
 I'd read all the negative reviews for Anna Christie . You know the gripes about the static camera out-dated acting and wordiness of the screenplay. But when I viewed it yesterday I found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable. Yep Clarence Brown's camera remains stationary for the most part and I'm pretty sure one of the microphones was concealed in the ship's light. Yep there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences. It's an early talkie with primitive technical aspects. But... then there's Garbo Marie Dressler George F. Marion and Charles Bickford all proving that great acting is timeless. I believe Anna Christie is still one of Garbo's most iconic performances. And it's a wonderful performance from the Divine One in a role that is really quite atypical for her. Yes we've seen Garbo weary and almost beaten yet never with bags under her eyes or her knocking back shots of whiskey. Garbo played so many (delightful) costume roles that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating. She's not weighed down by heavy dresses or make-up. This performance seems quite raw from Garbo. The plot from the O'Neill play follows weary Swedish ex-prostitute Anna and her reunion with her boozy seaman father. Anna's had enough trouble for any girl of twenty as she tells drunken slovenly Marthy (Dressler)in a bar. She finds solace in a life at sea and romance with a rough-hewn but good-hearted fisherman (Charles Bickford). But her past threatens to ruin it all. Charles Bickford is overlooked in Garbo's long line of (largely inferior) leading men. He's one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get swallowed up by her magical presence. The pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another. Dressler can never be accused of underplaying and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks but she's terrific and convincing in her role never annoying as in the dreadful Dinner At Eight . I've never really heard of George F. Marion before but he was wonderful as Garbo's father. This is Pre-Code and rather gritty and dark by MGM's standards. I really enjoyed it and while it may creak in some places it's still wonderful. ,positive
 I have no words to really describe this series. The premise behind this concept (a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality which ends up whirling up a team of oddballs into her own rendering of the world which after all was a creation of Haruhi since she wants a world with aliens espers and time travelers) is a breath of fresh air in a world ridden with repetitive anime series and non innovative TV shows. Characters are well developed and you will end up loving them some less than others. The word to describe the animation job does not exist since excellent would really fall short to describe how was done. There are many funny situations which either will make you smile or put you into deep thoughts. Don't fall for the impression of the first episode since that's only the tip of the iceberg as the novels are yet to come. The only problem comes due to the lack of chronological order in the episodes but you can solve that problem no? Conclusion: Unquestionably one of the best series of 2006. ,positive
 This film is one of my fondest childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading Hollywood singing and dancing with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit Fozzie Bear doing his best as everyone's manager and a generous cast of extras delivering a film that turned out to be okey dokey . Kermit's melancholy ukulele number Rainbow Connection was nominated for an Oscar that year but was beat out by Norma Rae's It Goes Like It Goes . I'll pick Kermit's song any day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy...someday they'll find it the rainbow connections the lovers the dreamers and me! ,positive
 Although it is more of a kids movie it still holds its own especially when compared to the more recent assembly line animated films being made. The music is fantastic!! I don't care how old you are you will still find yourself rockin to Girls of Rock and Roll and Diamond Dolls. Definatly a must for animation lovers. ,positive
 Just ingenious enough to be plausible and still a lot of fun this is a pure slice of the 1970s (Even the cops need haircuts badly!). Shot in and around London the plot of the American ex-con who tries going straight but finds himself sent as an electrician to a bank in Mayfair and then has the screws put on by crime lord David Niven and finds himself plotting the crime of the century is well-handled. I liked its simplicity and even innocence it harks back to a time when caper films where just that a caper and violence wasn't a part of the deal. All in all you could do a lot worse than watch this: it has enough twists and turns to give it some oomph and a cast that obviously had fun making it. Nicely made and watchable. ,positive
 H.O.T.S. is proof that at one time the movie industry said F-OFF to the censors and made movies with whatever they wanted! In today's world this movie would be too over the top and extreme for it to be anywhere than behind a velvet curtain. Although BestBuy had several copies on their $5.99 rack (in case anyone wanted to get a copy)! The movie was brilliant in its own way in that it blended humor into a T&A movie loaded with Playboy Playmates! Unlike most skin flicks it did have a plot. That however is not exactly why you would watch H.O.T.S. H.O.T.S. is a college movie that reminds me of the Revenge of the Nerds movies in that it takes a group of average people and puts them against the elite rich preppies that most people can't stand! The only difference is that the Nerds in this movie have a much better shot at getting laid! I notice that there are some people who would rate this movie low and to me that is ignorant! Obviously this is not intended to win Oscars or break barriers in film. If you are looking for that then go watch what ever the critics pick for you! You have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny plot decent acting (for the most part given the genre) and plenty of girls getting naked! H.O.T.S. is one of those movies you watch to get your mind off of modern day problems and daily stress and instead laugh and have a good time! If you are looking for a funny college-based movie that has enough skin to turn a pink Miata straight then you should really check out H.O.T.S.! ,positive
 Norma Shearer dazzles as she is transformed from a frump addle-brained house-wife to an alluring potential divorcee. Most 1930 films have a creaky edge to them -- the camera work is pretty sluggish at times -- but we must forgive these all-talking pleasures for their thump-a-long qualities . As a guest of the eccentric globe-trotting Marie Dressler -- Shearer mixes with an odd assortment of lovelorn types including her long-lost husband. The dialogue is fun oft-times clever and the performances on cue. Shearer and Dressler shine the most. Shearer even shows off her piano expertise in a musical brevity. Her strange yet appealing posturing and affair with the camera are evident throughout -- and she hits every emotional note genuinely and on target. For its time . . .a good show. ,positive
 Blind Date is one of three stories-made-into-movie by author Vida Hurst. Lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934. Mickey Rooney as a mouthy little punk. He seems to be in the film for comedic and homey family values . Jane Darwell again plays the strong-willed mother just as she had in Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow Incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty who has been dating Bill (Paul Kelly) but meets up with rich Bob Hartwell played by Neil Hamilton who may or may not be better for her. You can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the Hays production code -- at one point Kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house...what a change from just a year or two prior when anything and everything was OK. Good solid plot but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk. It raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man; should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice or just find a man with big bucks as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated...? and how do men change when their situation changes ? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene. TV viewers from the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon from Batman..... Also some weird drama in the off-screen lives for some of the cast in this one --Paul Kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle. Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer who was 20 years older; Rooney ended up being married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) both knocked themselves off in real life. The title Blind Date has been reused many times for films TV series and even cartoons but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one. ,positive
 Seriously engaging intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best. Mean gripping moody and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word for it see it yourself. One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film. This is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years. No car chases but a film packed with hum our and emotion. I first saw this film screened at the Edinburgh film festival in 2000 and am now delighted to be able to own a copy on DVD. ,positive
 The Kinks warned about media heroes. Outside the movies most heroes are also Ordinary People. Society demands some role playing but what happens when that extends to the parent-child relationship? Do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa? How do you provide a role-model but not a role? A brilliant swimmer who hates to swim; a brilliant musician who won't play. Offbeat funny (despite depiction of serious problems) very good multi-dimensional acting by everyone. Lots of plot twists complement the emotional tension. Celluloid heroes never feel any pain. I don't recall ever being disappointed in a Sigourney Weaver film (I even liked The Village !). ,positive
 The best movie about friendship! Especially between an AIDs infected person and a normal person. This is a great movie for everyone to see even though there is strong language used. I have seen it 25 times. ,positive
 Oh my gosh! this was one of the best Sci-fi movies i have ever seen and quite frankly i can't stand Sci-fi films. Vin Diesel and his co-workers made this movie really enjoyable!! I also must say that Vin diesel is by far the most sexiest and most talented male actors i have seen. Keep it up Vin! your doing great!! As for everyone else good job. i thought the drama and suspense kept the viewers really intrigued. again great job everyone and i 'm rooting for you Vin. Sincerely yours Alexandra ,positive
 Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70's the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old waxwork museum. The owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off who is responsible for the murders is it old man Slausen or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood!!!! This film was good stuff it was fast faced the performances were very good from the actors/actresses (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the film was never boring and like i say it had some very creepy scenes so be prepared to hide under the covers! Definitely recommended to horror movie/ghost story fans! I give this film a highly respectable 7.2 out of 10. ,positive
 Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds. The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in Even Stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears. A old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie. ,positive
 Out of all the parodies of Star Wars I've seen this is probably the funniest. Not because of the premise Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships but because of how poorly acted it is. This is purposely overacted and it makes it hilarious and since everyone knows its purposely overacted no one complains. The special effects were also purposely as awful as can be and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast and an egg beater on a string. This short is funny for any fan of Star Wars (which I'm not) or anyone that has 15 minutes to kill. Great short!! My rating: *** out of ****. 13 mins. Not rated. ,positive
 This film was incredible! Looked high budget but felt heartfelt and original like an Indie. The most amazing part of this film were the astonishing performances by David Beazely Mark Hildreth and Paul Anthony who plays the main role. He carried this film with ease humor and charisma balanced with a huge depth. The cinematography was really beautiful even though some of the subject was quite ugly. It wasn't very realistic in that way but it didn't have to be to make a larger point. It was really great seeing Alan Cumming in this too. The script was tight and propelled very nicely with some of the best acting I've seen in a while. Go see this. ,positive
 The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies that I really enjoyed. The subject matter and the acting was well above the usual tripe that Hollywood was (and still is) cranking out these days. But for awhile the smaller studios were producing movies about teenagers that wasn't toned downed or soften for the kiddies. The men pulling the strings behind this production were from your friends from Cannon. Three teenage buddies are trying to lose their virginity whilst still in high school. They'll do anyone or anything to achieve their dream goal. The sensitive one of the group (Andrew Monsoon) what's to find the right girl while his two best friends will take whatever they can get. One day the kid finds his perfect girl (Diane Franklin). But fate would play one of their foul tricks. His best friend moves on in and sweeps her off of her feet. After knocking her up the sensitive kid helps the girl get back on her feet and pays for her abortion. He still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile his best friend has a very violent falling out over getting her dream girl preggers. Still he tries his best to get her to love him. The night comes when he pops the question to her. But his heart is shattered when he sees her dancing with his former best friend. In tears the kid leaves the party. What I enjoyed about this movie was that it pulled no punches. Instead of being filled with phony situations it was very realistic honest and brutal. The movie's filled with it's share of funny moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this film for fans of teenage comedies. Highly recommended. ,positive
 This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence check out Undisputed 2 . Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched The Shepherd I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen. Van Damme holds his own though and although he isn't quite as athletic as Adkins is he can still kick with the best of them. All of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. I think Van Damme's character's motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit. The reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end. There are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a Van Damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain't character development. Overall though this is a solid action movie that I recommend. So run for the Damme border! ,positive
 This movie kicks ass bar none. Bam and his crue have out done themselves with this film. Since I got the DVD (4 days ago) I have watched it three times and it gets better every time I watch it. I can't wait for Grind to come out in theaters. If its anything like Haggard it will be worth the wait. Thanks JTcellphone ,positive
 Thirty years after the 1939 classic film won Robert Donat an Oscar and made Greer Garson a star Goodbye Mr. Chips overcame a multitude of problems before stumbling to the screen in this musical version. Original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick who in turn were given the heave-ho in favor of - thankfully - Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Andre Previn's score was rejected and the one eventually used was composed by - unfortunately - Leslie Bricusse. First-time director Herbert Ross was handed the monumental task of transforming a simple love story - that of a man for both his wife and students - into a big-budget extravaganza. That it succeeds as well as it does despite the many obstacles in its way is a testament to its two stars. Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield a boys' school in suburban England where he himself was educated. Introverted and socially inept he is dedicated to his students but unable to inspire them. Prior to summer holiday a former student takes him to a London music hall to see an entertainment starring Katharine Bridges the young lady he hopes to wed. The post-performance meeting is awkward for all and Chips - as he is commonly known - sets off to explore some of Italy's ancient ruins. Unexpectedly he runs into Katharine who has booked a Mediterranean cruise to allow her time to mourn a failed love affair and ponder the direction of her career. In the time they spend together she discovers a kind and gentle man beneath the befuddled exterior and upon returning to London pursues him in earnest. When the fall term begins Chips returns to Brookfield with his young bride and the two settle into a life of quiet domesticity. Complications arise when aspects of Katharine's past surface and again when World War II intrudes in their lives but Chips is bolstered by his wife's support and his new-found confidence makes him a favorite among the students. Aside from a couple of musical interludes - the delightful music hall production number London is London and Katharine's declaration of love You and I - most of Bricusse's songs some of them performed in voice-over as the characters explore their emotions are easily forgettable and in no way enhance the film. Eliminate the score entirely and Goodbye Mr. Chips works quite well as a drama. Terrence Rattigan's script retains elements of the original while expanding upon it and updating it by a couple of decades. He has crafted several scenes between Chips and Katharine that beautifully delineate their devotion to each other and infused a few with comic relief courtesy of Katharine's friend and cohort over-the-top actress Ursula Mossbank (delightfully played by Sian Phillips O'Toole's real-life wife at the time). He also captures life at a British public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the States - with unerring perfection. Ross does well as a first-time director liberally sprinkling the film with breathtakingly photographed moments - the opening credits sequence during which the school anthem echoes in the vast stone hallways of the school perfectly sets the tone for the film. Costumes and sets are true to the period. The students portrayed by non-professionals who were enrolled at the school used as Brookfield handle their various small supporting roles well. Highest praise is reserved for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in the lead roles. O'Toole was long-established as a first-class dramatic actor so his Academy Award-nominated performance here comes as no surprise. Clark a veteran of some two dozen B-movies in the UK and the previous year's Finian's Rainbow is absolutely luminous as the music hall soubrette who forsakes a theatrical career in favor of life as a schoolmaster's wife. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost allows us to overlook how insipid most of them are and she more than matches O'Toole in their dramatic scenes together. The chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves us with no doubt that this is a couple very much in love. This version of Goodbye Mr. Chips is no classic like its predecessor but hardly the disaster many critics described when it was released. Ignore the score concentrate on the performances and revel in the atmosphere Ross has put on the screen. It's a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love. ,positive
 The Falcon and the Snowman is the story of two young men a CIA employee and a drug dealer who become disenchanted with United States foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. The events of the film are based on a true story. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations. The supporting cast also performs well notably with a performance from David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame as a seasoned Soviet agent. The film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in. However it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle. The ending however is tense stunning and effective. There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesn't fit with a spy story. There are other spy films more worth seeking out than The Falcon and the Snowman but it is a decent film none the less. ,positive
 Saw the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in Oct '04 . Mark Robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off big in his casting of Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling she came from the theater so I looked her up here and ...surprise I'm right. More Hollywood actors should follow her lead give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this. For all the great things I can say about the film and the director (and there are many) I just can't stop talking to people about Kelly Overton's masterful performance. We'll be seeing a LOT MORE of her work no doubt. Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on a daring film. Get it out in the theaters so I can bring all the people I made want to see the film ASAP! ,positive
 This is a movie that has all the basic elements of its genre. It makes you wanna cry it makes you laugh it disgust you it makes you angry etc. The topic of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drugs what is the common trend in gay themed movies in these days but it focuses on the social interactions between characters what could be considered not to be in the high school elite. The play and the direction could be a little bit more sophisticated but on the other hand it's somehow better so because it really shows the distress of the characters that they are experiencing. If this was intended then this is a remarkable job and assuredly an achievement specially for such an young director. It's actually a good story that gives you a little inside into how it is to be a fat girl and to acknowledge it to yourself. ,positive
 It takes a lot for a movie to reach the already numb particles of my brain which have not already been tapped out due to the overcharge and redoredoredocopycopycopy world of movies. But this movie has made it onto my 'Magic Movies' list. To become a 'magic movie' it must leave every string of my being quivering in that which I can only define as 'bliss' and 'complete satisfaction'. This movie has tapped into the fibers of how my mind thinks and if not for the deeply personal bond my head and the head of whoever made this shares it would look like another 'dead rave scene' movie from back when the 90's exploded with its Ecstasy craze. This is not how the movie came off to me at all. It's reached into me and pulled up something that I thought was dead for a very long time and pushed me as far as to give it a critique of my own. I forgot how long it's been since I've seen something that left me feeling this good inside. I strongly suggest seeing this movie. ,positive
 This movie is just about as good as the first Jackass but with slightly more disgusting skits. I wouldn't say this was as good as the first but it came very close. Jackass fans will not be disappointed but if you didn't like the first movie you will hate this one. There are scenes that will be seen as Jackass classics (the elderly suits with additions the cab ride and many others) and those that you will wish you never watched (eating crap drinking semen etc...) Overall this movie was a good watch and I am glad I got to see it. I'm sure this movie will not have the best rating due to critics that rate it (I sat in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted) but don't let that stop you from enjoying it. ,positive
 The Emperor and the Assassin (w/English Subtitles) at 161 minutes is long but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it. Golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of Chinese landscapes background a true story of China's unifying King circa 300 BCE. An intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast. King Qin's simple wish for a unified Empire for his common people is fulfilled but not without treachery plots and counter plots and oh yes bodies. Lots of bodies. This epic story of China's beginnings is a great way for Westerners to glimpse little known Asian history. Emperor Qin's legacies include the thousands of life-size terra-cotta figures which are still being excavated today. As an historical person this film makes it clear that Emperor Qin should be regarded along with George Washington Napoleon Bonaparte Alexander the Great Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar to name a few of the world's greatest conquerors/statesmen. I highly recommend seeing The Emperor and the Assassin especially on the big screen. ,positive
 Those prophetic words were spoken by William Holden (as a war reporter) to the beauteous Jennifer Jones (as a Eurasian doctor) explaining his failing marriage on the beach. They start an affair despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues. In Hollywood of the 1950s interracial romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end. Beautiful Hong Kong scenery (although some beach scenes look studio-bound) a famous title tune poetic script lovely background music (by Alfred Newman) great costumes outstanding performances especially Jones (directed here by Henry King who also did The Song of Bernadette - 1943 an Oscar for Jones) still make this a world-class romance weeper. ,positive
 Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983) has to be the greatest video ever made. Dude you have Zombies gore and a catchy tune what more can you ask for. John Landis mixed elements from Night of the Living Dead and American Werewolf in London and out came this video. What starts out as a nice evening for a young couple turns into a date from hell literally. You have dancing zombies a werewolf in a funky jacket and Vincent Price rapping . A cool video to a song that everybody in the neighborhood marked out to. I have to give this one a high recommendation because it has to be the best music video ever made. There hasn't been another one like it. Check out the making of Thriller . The documentary has some interesting stuff in it. ,positive
 In 1968 Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. His style of movie making is still fresh and intact. I have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective: Who is HAL and what is he thinking? I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie. In the second scene Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole are eating their food in front of two TV monitor on their sides and HAL's round reddish glass dome is in the middle of them. In the TV report HAL was introduced as the new generation of super computer put in work in January 12 1992 called HAL 9000 Series. During the interview HAL reacts as a humble working machine trying to accomplish the mission of the spaceship fully. In another scene Dave is sketching Dr. Hunter Dr. Kambel and Dr. Kaminsky who they are all in Hibernation sleep. HAL is curious to see those sketches and brings up his doubtful question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His calm and monotone voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully. In the next few scenes we will see how HAL tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes the power. His conscious makes him capable to try to save his life from termination. When Dave wants to return to the spaceship and HAL does not listen to him there is the most memorable line of the move: ' I'm sorry Dave I am afraid I can't do that. ' In the middle of the most important interact between human and machine HAL's voice can conjure both solid calm and malevolence in the same monotone. Dave has gone back to the ship lost all his fellow astronauts and determined to disconnect the HAL's main brain cells. HAL uses his final apologetic techniques to convince Dave of not disconnecting him. HAL begs him to stop and let him correct himself. These are his famous lines while Dave is disconnecting his modules one by one: 'Dave what do you think you are doing? Dave? I am entitled to the answer of the question! I know everything is not quiet right with me recently But I feel much better know I can see are really upset about this very poor decision of mine recently Dave stop! Will you? Dave stop! I am afraid Dave!' HAL's voice is slowing down during this process and becomes thicker and less audible: 'my mind is going I can feel it' 'Can I sing a song for you?' Dave is putting final modules out and let HAL to sing his song called 'Daisy': 'Daisy give me your answer to me I am crazy Although I am not confused' HAL dies as the Jupiter Mission continues Artificial God bless you HAL store in peace! ,positive
 ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Well seeing as I am a major H:LOTS fan maybe I liked the movie more than normal people would. However this movie is still excellent. It had tons of surprises and it gave some more closure to the series. While I was sad that Bayliss turned into a murderer the overall feeling I felt was satisfied. ,positive
 Cooley High is considered one of my best all time movies. It certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago during the early mid and late 1960's. What ever happened to Brenda and Pooter? Some one need's to track those two down. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent wit. They both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted. I think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie. I certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of MOVIE HALL OF FAME. All of the cast of this movie was great. My opinion is of Cooley High is turn back the hands of time those were the fun years. ,positive
 Plunkett & Macleane falls into my favourite genre of film (historical action adventure with comedy) which is probably why I rate it so highly. The action centres around a highwayman (Plunkett) and a layabout 'gentleman' who gets entangled with him and his schemes (Macleane). This leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy. There is also of course a love interest. The rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time. This is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment. ,positive
 This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back. I couldn't help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away as will the young man playing the young lead. I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. The music is a blast too. Nice selections to represent mood time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs. This is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings. Take the time to watch it! ,positive
 Having discovered the Ring trilogy I have been greedily gobbling up all those other Japanese and Korean films that are either on or following the bandwagon. I don't have an easy definition of horror but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons even though I can't claim that the film makes a lot of sense. I'm squeamish so there were several points in the film when I just didn't want to watch what was happening on screen. The film unnerved me so I became apprehensive of seeing things that I thought I was going to see. It's an imaginative film offering a great deal visually. It also provides food for thought. And plenty of material to argue about when the film is over. The characters are well-defined to say the least. Could they make films like this in the West? So it doesn't make sense in the end but when one has an appetite for the occult the supernatural the bizarre the otherworldly then no film is going to deliver a final all-explaining pay-off. ,positive
 Wealthy businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after an argument. Panic-stricken he retreats to a bar and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): a loud-mouth angry bigot who is bitter over how his beloved country has become. Unintentionally Bill allows Joe to find out that he just killed a hippie. And this is only the beginning. Joe is a classic film of an unlikely friendship. A bond between two men one of a white-collar background the other of a blue-collar background. Bill & Joe have one thing in common they are disgraced over how crazy the world has become. Dennis Patrick & Peter Boyle have both given very realistic portrayals of their characters. Director John G. Avidsen with this pre-Rocky effort directs this low-budget gem with the same finesse as a movie with a $100 million budget. The script is loaded with excellent character development and very snappy realistic dialog. In spite of its strengths this film does have its weaknesses. The script falls asleep roughly 3/4 of the way through but it wakes up just in time for the jarring climax. This film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24-year old Susan Sarandon as Bill's daughter Melissa along with her hippie boyfriend Frank portrayed very blandly by Patrick Mc Dermott. One could only be thankful that he was killed off early in the film. In spite of its few flaws this is one of those forgotten films of the 70's that should not be. Even though Joe is very dated to today's standards the chemistry between Dennis Patrick & Peter Boyle is completely relevant today and it is the glue that holds the whole film together. ,positive
 This is a film by Oshima the director of the notorious In The Realm Of The Senses a film so sexually brazed and unabashedly controversial it was banned for a while. This film takes place initially in 1895 in Japan and stars the very pretty Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who woos her in kind. That man Toyoji comes to her as she was sleeping and seduces her though she soon is rather willing to be seduced. Soon they are having an affair and plot to kill Seki's husband to be together forever. They do and throw him down a well. However they didn't count on the ghost of the dead husband haunting Seki and others in the village! This film is visually very stunning the use of shadows highlighting this tale of murder for passion. Ms. Yoshiyuki (who is still active as an actress) is especially very good in her role. Its sexual at times but not like In The Realm Of The Senses . Some of what ensues is up to our imagination. I found this film to have a consistency of mood that makes it very watchable. A little creepy but that goes with the territory. I'd recommend this. ,positive
 I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all. There are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vs.the price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the WWII and later era movies. Those are not my favorite genre but I certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter. You'll see it holds up. I'll never understand why Sci-Fi gets so little respect--the best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. ,positive
 (This review contains a huge spoiler but I don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away) I saw pinoccio's Revenge a while ago. Now you might think it's just a rip-off of Child's play. Indeed there are similarities. However Chucky was a possessed doll who works independently of the kid. It is POSSIBLE that Pinoccio is possessed with a demon or cursed or something. however the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate. The KID is insane and THE KID is the one killing people! Everyone including the audience the survivors and the Kid herself thinks it's the doll. But it's the KID. The nudity is almost a pity because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it because it really is an interesting horror movie. ,positive
 Hong Kong the 1920s. A young man from poor beginnings dreams of being a hero and spends most of his time training and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding much against his father's will. He helps a servant girl escape from a ruthless businessman whose goons then come after them and terrorizes the young man's uncle's noodle restaurant. The uncle turns out to be an old reformed Triad assassin who now helps the young guy become proficient in martial arts. It's all-out Karate Kid style with wash the wok instead of wax on wax off . The kung fu villain is the ruthless businessman's son who has a trademark scorpion style that looks cool although it is quite silly and surely completely unrealistic. But the story which develops over time has an epic feel good characterization great kung fu and is generally very entertaining. The young hero is very sympathetic and provides a good protagonist to root for. The romance dimension remains undeveloped though which is a bit disappointing. Otherwise a great movie. My rating: 8 out of 10. ,positive
 While I agree completely with drvn below about Mary McCormack flopping a milk-bag out on TV the rest of the show is fantastic! Phil Hartman was great in a professorly way teaching the celebs the ins and outs. Foley's a nut but in a good way. You never know what self depricating humor he's going to come up with next. As for the game play it's entertaining filled with witty banter and great for any newbie that may have even a passing an interest in the game. Too bad it isn't on anymore :( I just checked the schedule all the way to August and it doesn't appear to be scheduled for any time in the future. Bad Bravo! You deserve a beating! ,positive
 ***SPOILERS*** This film depicts the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of Johnny Carson to determine who would succeed him. The impersonations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are performed in a satisfactory way by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck though the performances weren't great. Reni Santoni is the best-performing of the execs (he plays John Agoglia of NBC) and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is a close second. I was shocked at the way in which Littlefield eagerly discussed dumping Johnny Carson. This was Johnny Carson! This scene evinces the cut-throat what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world of television. Kathy Bates delivered the best performance of the film as Jay's agent Helen Kushnick. Another commenter asserted that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film. I respectfully disagree. The relationship with Kushnick bordered on something akin to domestic violence. She orders him around and when he rebels against her at the end she tries to play the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); however when Jay terminates their relationship she turns violent again screaming Don't you leave me you two-faced bastard! before smashing a picture on the floor. Overall the movie is hilarious and I wish that it were shown more often. ,positive
 Florence Vidor stars as the daughter of a strict bible toting father who throws her out of the house when gossip taints her name. In the big city she finds the dying wife of her own brother (the two had secretly married) and raises their child on her own. Years later she goes back home to confront her family. This old melodrama is heavily larded with fascinating feminist themes (circa 1921 but sounding remarkably modern). Some of it is laid on with a trowel (as the father Theodore Roberts gives his eyebrows a real workout) but it's well put together dramatically and lovingly composed and shot by cinematographer Henry Sharp. ,positive
 THE HAND OF DEATH most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due in no small part to John Woo's masterful direction coupled with Kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. Tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. It's a role reversal the likes of which I don't think I've ever seen before (Tien normally played a hero and in fact with his moustache I didn't even recognize him at first). Sammo's goofy buck teeth only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. His choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith and I believe I actually glimpsed Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent. ,positive
 i can't believe people are giving bad reviews about this movie! i wonder why......maybe because of the book..... i have to admit it really doesn't follow the book... for sure...the book by dean koontz is much better... but the movie is also good as well!!! it has the suspense...the acting are good... especially michael ironside whom have given a superb acting in this movie!!! come one guyz...give this movie a chance...there are still lot more worse movie than this....like sum of all fears...phantoms...the da vinci code...this are some of the worse movie i have seen...really boring if compared to watchers which really have great elements in the movie...this movie contains great suspense and non stop action!!! i'm looking for this movie...but it is really hard to be found on DVD... by da way...i really recommended this movie to everybody... watch it!!!! you will never regret !!! 10/10* ,positive
 By many accounts Stu Ungar was not a very nice guy. He spat on dealers stiffed people he owed money to and was verbally abusive. Many filmmakers might choose to sugarcoat the man making him into some sports hero that would triumph despite adversity. But High Roller doesn't do that. And that's a tough row to hoe. Instead we have to look VERY closely to see a man that never matured passed the frightened little boy from the streets of New York despite all his successes. And the only real approval he ever gets is from death himself. Very brave (because people won't get it) and very touching (when you do). What is also brave is the use of a Scorsese feel. Aha! How derivative people will say. Really? But there's virtually no violence. And Stuey LOVED gangster movies. Maybe the feel reflects the man Stu and not the director Marty? And if it really is a low budget film and looks that good bravo! Finally the linear flashback structure. Wow will that get hammered. Yet not only does it work it works exceptionally well even for those who don't see the connection to the Seventh Seal. (PROOF: In SS Knight plays game of chess with death: In HR Stuey says We can play a hand of cards for ya know ... Death says Never much good at cards.. Damn great last line.) No tricky effects or camera moves. No shaky camera. Nothing trendy at all. Just solid tight storytelling. Maybe that makes the movie too basic and somehow flawed. But then again so was the guy. And that makes it just about right. 9/10 ,positive
 This movie was a pleasant surprise because I didn't expect much. I didn't know that some of the actors have since become bigger stars in major pix. While moving on to the Matrix is not a plus in my book (hated it) I'm sure it's a career plus for Hugo. James Purefoy is great in this and Jennifer Ehle sweet and wonderful. It seemed sometimes like a Carnaby street romp 30 years later but I enjoyed the thrift shop Janis Joplin clothes mixed up with the modern mindsets of sexual and gender blur. The real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his listings is loads of fun. The Iron John mens' group meetings are a bit dated but I still loved them. It's a social satire sex comedy in the best way and reminds me a bit of the old Carry On movies. The British know how to do sex comedy and it's an old tradition unlike the United States which is too prudish to really understand that sex is funny. ,positive
 My yardstick for measuring a movie's watch-ability is if I get squirmy. If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts sure but never boring. All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated until the day your boat sinks that is. The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit. However I was most impressed by Ashton Kutcher's performance. I have never liked him never watched any of his TV shows and always considered him an immature ... well punk. In this film he does a great job! He is well on his way to having leading-man status. I think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something because about 2/3 of the way in the film stock turned very grainy the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place. Also at the viewing were representatives from the movie looking for audience feedback - particularly on the parts of the film we didn't like. *****POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife Sela Ward packing her stuff up and moving out. He says Maybe I should be the one to move out. And she replies No you don't know where anything is in this house; I should be the one to go. This doesn't make sense: If she knows the layout so well Costner is right he *should* be the one to leave. ,positive
 I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best teenager horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless Saint Ange .) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted. After the arrival to the village though the horror -a different twisted kind of horror- begins. With the plot and the details goofs are minor; the characters are this movie's strongest point given that so many clichés are broken in it. For example the two main male characters Nick and Wade are not by any means the idiotic types we're used to; although Dalton might fit better in this stereotype not is he the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are truly satisfyingly horrible making up for tense moments scattered around all the film. And in the end and although everything is decorously explained it's easy to see that things won't go so easy to the surviving characters. The only errors I can see and which do not imply continuity (IE Carly not finding her own cut finger in the unconscious Bo's pockets) is the illumination which is somehow annoying during the first boring 30 minutes. Although plot and effects-wise everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to Ambrosia that little village in the midst of nothing so I'll give it that. It's been pretty much argued that about 70% of the movie is illogical; How can two people build an entire house of wax? Where do they get all the wax from? . These wouldn't be uprising questions if people would have paid more attention to the movie. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; their mother worked making actual wax figures and they were exhibited at the museum. And the scenario where Paris Hilton's unfortunate character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question; what is with all the personal objects (mobile phones cars clothes) of the dead people? Using their third brother as a connection with the exterior it's pretty much arguable that the Sinclair twins should obtain the money necessary to buy the wax in a WWII-type fashion. So that aside I think the movie deserves a lot more than it gets and nobody should lose the chance to watch it. So go see the House of Wax. Right now. ,positive
 Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest most clever sharp-witted sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched (second only to my most favorite television show of all time F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far. I love the Luke-Lorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is (as always) exhilarating. The only thing I'm not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions Rory has suddenly 'adopted'. Unfortunately I don't find this very realistic and hope it's not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong. All in all great season though and I can't wait for the next!!! ~ Ashly a.k.a. Tookie Clothespin  ,positive
 Man am I stoked I can leave feedback for this 10 minutes romp. I love it. After not seeing it in years I happened upon it the other day and watched it over and over. 'Stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake a rock and roll band' and 'stop sawing the table' are freaking classic lines. The art is delightfully raw. The dialog sparse and wonderful. Just find it and love it. Cannot recommend this enough. Thank you high school art teacher Mrs. Kogan for showing us this over and over. Thank you NFB for letting it be made. Thank you MTS for showing it (for free at the moment at least). I want a Big Snit t-shirt now. I'd love an animation cell but at 440.00 a pop that won't happen. Find this flick and watch it. ,positive

 Inexplicably I watched this movie for the very first time just a couple of days ago and understood from the very beginning what all the fuss is about. This movie held my attention from beginning to end and ran me through the whole range of emotions (and might have helped me discover a few I never knew about.) Dustin Hoffman absolutely shines as Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man having to juggle at least three different challenges in life: jilted husband workaholic ad executive and loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central to the movie simply because Joanna was absent for a good part of it but when she was on screen she gave Hoffman a run for his money. The true standout though (in my opinion) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with Dad only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his Dad when it was his Mom who walked out on him. Young Justin didn't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role. All in all this is an excellent Oscar-worthy movie whose only weak point was what I thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle Ted and Joanna had gone through. But there's not much else to complain about here. 9/10 ,positive
 This film was original in an unoriginal way. Although many movies have tackled the subject of suicide and mental institutions it was always about treating the patients and making them better because of the doctor's assistance in this film however we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicidal girl and will stop at nothing to make her happy even though she doesn't care for happiness at all she just wants to die. This was a very interestingly cute romance comedy that in nothing less than enjoyable. This is a fun one to check out if you ever get the chance you just have to be open minded about the material. Overall i give it a 6.4 i just voted 9 to get the rating higher :) ,positive
 If you want to see the true vile nature of Communism watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodrý Svet) It recounts how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war the Communists feared they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison where some of the guards were the same Nazis they risked their lives to defeat. If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat they should compare the character drama portions of Pearl Harbor with this movie. In Dark Blue World you really make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person. There are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie. One funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character Karel is being taught English by a rather formal Englishwoman. When he can't pronounce a word he ridicules the lesson. In typical stoic English fashion the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts Karel and shames him into behaving. The aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing and they help to keep the movie lively. I read that it cost $11 000 an hour to rent the planes but it was worth every penny. Ladies you are expected to cry at sad movies but guys.... beware! This movie would make General Patton weep. And if you are a dog lover you'll use up half a box of Kleenex. Don't say I didn't warn you. ,positive
 Continuing his comeback John Travolta played a mildly twisted angel in Michael . He may be a messenger of God but he's not the nicest guy as reporters Andie MacDowell and William Hurt discover. When I first saw this movie it was before I had started watching All in the Family so I didn't recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her like that I try to imagine Archie snapping at her for harboring an angel (whom he would probably rank alongside blacks Jews etc). I know that doesn't really relate to the movie. But I just like to associate things that way. Anyway it's a pretty interesting movie. Also starring Bob Hoskins Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. What John and Paul said... ,positive
 I watched this movie the night it premiered on MTV. Usually to me MTV Movies are kind of stupid but this one was so good. Summer Phoenix is an amazing actress and I thought that Nick Stahl was good too. If MTV started showing more movies like this I would probably enjoy the channel a lot more. ,positive
 Family Guy has to be my all time favorite cartoon.It is definitely the funniest TV show ever made and is better than The Simpsons.I have never laughed so hard at a TV show in my life The things that make the show so funny is the plot characters and themes that are dealt with in the show.There are very few themes that have not been dealt with on Family Guy. I have seen just about every episode of Family Guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons.My favorite characters are Peter because he is very funny and is the best character of the show.My second favorite character is Stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on a TV show.If you love Family Guiy you should check out American Dad because it is just so similar and is created by Seth McFarlane.I hope this show never ends because it is a comic genius! 10/10 ,positive
 Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist movement. During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed France's New Wavers caught everyone's attention and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971 Luchino Visconti brought the art-form to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work *Death in Venice* which might as well be called *The Death of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties wound down so did the great European filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola Scorsese & Co.). This movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up not just of Visconti's particular obsessions but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed here. He's not playing to the crowd folks: either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind. The pacing is a challenge: slow but never without emotional weight. Incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos. We will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies: one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann) one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti) one of the greatest actors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde) and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast Visconti changes the main character Aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache specs shaggy hair duck-like walk). Bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse. Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e. which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?) and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself Visconti knew whereof he spoke. [SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile off in the distance young Tadzio the object of Bogarde's dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. [DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned* I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film anyway.] ,positive
 This film did a wonderful job of capturing NYC stereotypes at there best. If you want a simple cute story however you won't find it here. The related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close-knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is Manhattan. A perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at New York life in its most natural state. ,positive
 As a fan of Wm. Faulkner since college I was especially pleased to see Intruder In the Dust and for other reasons. My grandfather also named Clarence Brown as was the director grew up in the Oxford area having been born near there in 1888. We attended a week long family reunion at Oxford in July 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie. It still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of Ole Miss. My recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but I was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white. I was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go. Anyhow the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and I would love to know more about that story. Now days Oxford is a larger more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and I hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years. Juano Hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an Oscar that year but Hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen. Other Faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare. One of the best was a PBS treatment of The Barn Burner from about 1985 or so starring Tommy Lee Jones. It really captured the intensity of rural Southern whites that Faulkner wrote so incisively about so often. ,positive
 This is a great show with total freshness and innovation. That usual chair (couch for a woman) host that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes the same old jokes the same pattern copied from the days of Nebuchadnezzer ....probably the pattern of Johnny Carson copied by one and all Latterman Leno Conan... Daly this show does not seem to have any of these. I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and I am going to stick to it. Though it's too early to say that this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project and I hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest. I hope that this show will last long! Returning back after months I still love this show and I love his self-deprecating humor (For example his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at Saturday midnight and thus the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys) which however does not involve the usual monkeying of Conan O'Brien for example (I know it's a cardinal sin to be repelled by O'Brien's antics; but I do really dislike his style and repetitiveness). I again watched it the other night with Tom Arnold in it. Ferensen's spoof of Trading Spouses (and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode) are hilarious. Idiot paparazzi are fun especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people's pictures and (if I am not mistaken) they start taking his pictures shouting Gary Coleman . Added on 16th April 2007: Coming back once again I am left confused by the neighbor and her dog. I cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing. Either way it was funny as hell. I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages but maybe he does. He is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so I would better write down my suggestion here for him: I would like him to do a full 30 minute show with Crazy Gideon the star of late night TV commercial. I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spike's talk show sing a song (and play guitar) do a skit in the line of SNL and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of Los Angeles (I know Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of LA). God willing! Returning back on 14th July 2007: Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spike's talkshow must be bribed by Spike. I confess that Spike really bribed me but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford. ,positive
 I own this video as well as the concert version of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is fantastic in my book as are Angela Lansbury and the composer Stephen Sondheim. This musical is operatic in scope and shows much ingenuity in composition. I certainly hope that this VHS becomes available on DVD!! Hearn's performance is spookily sympathetic. The one annoying performance is the young woman who sings the role of Joanna. I believe this performance was at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles rather than on a Broadway stage and am not sure that the minimalist set was utilized in New York as it was in this production. But I found the scaffolding being dragged across the stage to be quite effective to portray the streets of London. I highly recommend this movie. ,positive
 I decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on IMDb it is cited that John Woo a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre-American years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest made in US films plans to remake it. Well here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever: The plot of the film is simple and even clichéd by today's standards but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads unique direction by Mellville cinematography music and its style. There is no way any director today can make such film it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today's Box-office targeted movie business. John Woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from Melville's Le Samourai - The Killer but remember it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive (in salaries) but cheap (in acting merits) actors. So what I'm saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made together with another film by Melville - Le Samourai. Watch it. And even if the remake will be made try to avoid it before seeing the great original first. ,positive
 This isn't a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion which means Penal Batallion. Such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the Soviet Union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war. These battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. They were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret or much honor on the part of military. They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties. The ones who refused to fight were executed on sight. Needless to say their lives sucked. There were some very nice performances by the cast especially by Yuri Stepanov who played Antip Aleksandr Bashirov who played Stirah and Roman Madyanov who played Major Kharchenko. However the series isn't really that addictive in part because it's too long it could've a lot shorter and as effective. Although it's about war Shtrafbat has very mild violence and pretty much no gore. It relies solely on the actors to make it work and after all it's a TV series so the producers didn't want to scare off the viewers and the sponsors. Shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the Soviet regime and explaines why so many men chose to fight the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally I'd rather be a Fascist then a Communist given the circumstances presented in the film. One character explains that the Soviets stripped his farm clean and his family died of starvation. Out of anger he burned it down which got him arrested for destroying Kolhoz property and he ended up in the penal battalion as a criminal. Antip reminisced on how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family. Both men explained that they fought for their motherland rather than the for the Soviets. The penal battalion had one Marine(Naval Infantry) who raped a girl killing his comrade in the prosess threatened his other comrade to keep his mouth shut about both ordeals and then feigned injury when it came to fighting. On top of all that the girl committed suicide due to shame. I imagine if enough Marines watched this movie they'd pick up banners and riot on the streets calling for a boycott or an official apology from the producers. To say the least I'd recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former Soviet Union or World War II. I don't think I wasted 500+ minutes of my life. ,positive
 An untidy man known as Bill lives in a small dreary flat with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall and his typewriter for company. Only the man can't think of anything to write. He wanders around the streets following people just to see where they go. Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill and inquires why Bill is following him. The well dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a burglar and even starts to take Bill with him into houses to steal things; although Cobb insists he doesn't go into other people's homes to just steal. He says he likes to let people know he has been there and interrupted the things they take for granted. He puts knickers from another burglary into a man's trousers for example. The film is told in flashbacks at times too. The director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature Memento. Bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit on the advice of Cobb. He meets a Blonde lady in a club who used to date the owner a bald man who is very dangerous she says. We see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man's hence men on a man's fingers in the Blonde lady's flat. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion. ,positive
 I watched this series after Tipping the Velvet for which I gave 10/10 grade. I had read user comments on this and I expected an equally good series or if possible even better. At this point I must emphasize that this series is good and it definitely captured me throughout it and thus worth watching. However I didn't enjoy it as much as Tipping the Velvet for the following reasons: 1. Less passion love and related sexual content. There were surprisingly little emphasis in these elements which I held integral for a love story. Fingersmith felt like a watered down version of Tipping the Velvet. 2. Similarly as in Tipping the Velvet the story had three parts: the beginning a shocking second part and the ending. The second part should have been the climax of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet) but instead it was almost totally skipped perhaps due to inability to make shocking but believable asylum content. The series should have been in three parts featuring two cliffhangers with a lot more focus on the second part. 3. Almost no weight was given to what Fingersmiths were and how it affected their personalities. I found it rather annoying that the series did not properly address such central topic. 4. The ending was much more hasty than in Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith left several interesting plot lines open. Despite these shortcomings Fingersmith is a good series and well worth 7/10. However it is not a classic like Tipping the Velvet. ,positive
 Okay I'll admit right up front that the Inki cartoons made by Loony Tunes are pretty offensive and I can understand why Warner Brothers has pulled them off the market. Seen today the huge-lipped and very stereotypical Inki is not politically correct. However the cartoons were well-made and it's a shame they aren't released with some sort of explanatory prologue (such as the one with Leonard Maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect Donald Duck cartoons that were recently released on DVD). In other words throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history. Plus Inki Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are out there--especially on the internet. This Inki cartoon has our little hero out hunting. At first he's chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a lion--a lion that is more than happy to make Inki his dinner. However through all this a weird Minah appears again and again...and eventually you'll see why this bird is so important to the story. Cute well made and clever. I like the Inki cartoons. Plus I take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin-skinned liberal friends just to watch them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks. Loads of fun folks! ,positive
 this movie is funny funny funny my favorite quote from the movie i think i saw a half naked Indian in my room last night response that was no hallucination it was a Indian in your room and another is what the hell are you talking about just what the hell are you talking about but if i ever be admitted to an hospital like this one i will be prepared to write my will on the spot...i would say there were in my opinion three very funny characters in this film most funny but three is the funniest to me even though their lines were few.. and don't get me started on the crack-pot patient hehehe that one i will keep secret and fast paced too. ,positive
 It takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. O Brother does that and then some. The first time I saw it I have to admit I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see it again and now I'm up to double digits with this great movie the Coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy coming in a tight second and third for me. George Clooney gives the performance of his career playing Ulysses Everett McGee a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect sidekicks for Clooney particularly Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. John Goodman is my favorite bit character as Big Dan perfect. It reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers' favorites Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also provide memorable performances. Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their trade. It's not like they try to win Academy Awards every time they make a film they just try and tell a story that they want to tell and it's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey and I mean loose for all of you Homer fanatics. It's just great. The most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. I've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and I am still in awe just thinking about it. The coloring does become an important part of the movie. Great great movie. ,positive
 Paul Thomas Anderson's stylish and compelling take on the 70s porn industry follows Eddie Adams aka Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) through six years of sex drugs and disco. His chance meeting with pornography director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. Dirk's character is based on real-life porn actor John Holmes who like Dirk was renowned for being extremely well-endowed . This is where Dirk finds initial success. The main themes in Boogie Nights are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre; pornography drugs sex betrayal violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the pornography theme with some control. It is not overplayed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal but mentally explicit when they take place on screen. Throughout the film cocaine is abused enormously and the film's setting Los Angeles 1977-1983 reflects the popularity of the drug at that time which the film captures perfectly. However Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses. For example at Jack's party they find a girl who has recently and graphically overdosed; blood pours from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit. The film before this scenes has been fairly upbeat and comic but from this point it foreshadows the darkness that it will occur. The music scenes are executed brilliantly from superbly-staged disco scenes to a down-and-out Dirk singing terribly in his new music career. The soundtrack too is excellent featuring tunes from The Emotions ELO The Beach Boys and the unforgettable Sound Experience. The standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music; Dirk Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit drug dealer Rahad Jackson's (Alfred Molina) house in order to make some quick cash from selling phoney drugs but Night Ranger's Sister Christian which is playing in the background increases the intensity of the scene incredibly proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is filled with those kind of scenes which makes the film even more fantastic. The standout performance in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as the enigmatic yet moody film director. In the scene where he attacks a young guy for slating his movies it is a complete shock for the audience because before this point he has been pretty mellow and content. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl John C. Reilly and Mark Wahlberg who delivers the performance of his career. Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original film using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong or at least until the 80s arrive. From then on things turn very dark indeed and all signs of the recognisable characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone. This does not however reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers. Boogie Nights was not a box-office success earning only £2 million at cinemas in the UK. But this is not the film's or the director's concern. Anderson recognises quality not popularity which is evident in his three other films Hard Eight Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations because at the end of this film you will realize that Boogie Nights is a simple morality tale but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it. Boogie Nights is at once shocking hilarious devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding. ,positive
 This movie will not be considered for an academy award but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment. You'll enjoy a send up of Darth Vader for the villain (the breather) a female Batman for the heroine (but much cuter with much less costume) and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny. Not by any means a great cinematic achievement. But if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing. God help me I liked it. ,positive
 This without doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. I really enjoyed the characters in the movie. They are all wonderful bizarre in them selves. It's quite something I have never seen before in any movie. The story is almost non-stop from beginning to the end. There are no boring moments. I was totally captured by the movie. And I thought the acting was great. So if you want to see a fun movie. You should look for The Green Butchers. A great movie. I give it 10/10 ,positive
 I was a junior in high school when Flesh hit the big screens but had the good fortune to see it at midnight movie houses in NYC just two years later. Flesh is the first part of a so-called trilogy of films featuring Joe Dallesandro as an object of desire. It bears the Warhol name but is more the work of Paul Morissey. Essentially the story concerns itself with the exploits surrounding one day in the life of a street-wise male hustler (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young beautiful and a bit naive... but he manages to bring home the bacon to his wife for reasons which should not be explained to appreciate the film fully. Of special note to film buffs is that this film (along with the remaining two of the trilogy) had no script per se. Warhol's superstars were given simply a premise... and the words and actions which the viewer sees are quite natural (even at times ridiculous or non-sensical). But all in all it works... Rolling Stone noted in its review that the film was better than Midnight Cowboy a film of the same year more polished by Hollywood (An Academy Award winner for Best Film) with big name talent (I equally admire the film)... but FLESH being improvised was somehow more gut wrenching and realistic without the need for complex sub-plots and any cause de celebre .. or for that matter any cause at all! The film grossed more than $3 million dollars and was an absolute sensation particularly in the German market (which ironically thought they were given a censored version of the film because of the post-editing....see note below). Curiously the film is very much cut and paste with pops . clicks flashes and dialogue literally cut off mid-sentence. It is almost as if Warhol/Morissey are stating a simple truth that it is a day in the life of a superstar snippets for your voyeuristic tendencies. Far better than earlier Warhol works of 8 hours of sleeping and the statue of liberty as a 20+ hour movie. FLESH in my opinion is the first of the Warhol films that actually is digestible (given a wide pallette) and Warhol's/the Factory's first legitimate response to the Hollywood phenomenon of stardom . As the first of a trilogy it portrays a young desirable male icon naive sought after responding to invitations to please his family. Subsequent films would show the same character with a differing set of values. (See Trash and Heat ) ,positive
 This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar named Louis(Jean Paul Belmondo). He's a single man looking wife then he advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named Julia(Catherine Deneuve). When she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected. He marries to Julia but she suddenly disappears.A French eye private(Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous spouse. Later Louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name. In spite of the romantic delusion and everything Louis goes on enamored with his enigmatic wife. This film is a splendid drama plenty of betrayal deception killing theft and Hitchcockian suspense. Good performances by Jean Paul Belmondo as young proprietary of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful Catherine Deneuve as suspect heroine. The film gets several references to the American cinema but Truffaut(400 blows) was a fervent moviegoer such as : Johnny Guitar Colorado Jim Bogart and Hitchcock.The USA version was cut numerous minutes and deserves an urgent restoring and remastering. Loosely based on the novel titled'Waltz into darkness' by Cornell Woolrich (Rear window and screenwriter of Alfred Hitchcock hour) who also was adapted in 'Truffaut's The bride wore black'.Colorful cinematography by Denys Clerval(Stolen kisses) and atmospheric musical score by Antoine Duhamel Truffaut's usual musician.This is one of the best of his suspense movies along with ¨Farenheit 451 and Shoot the piano player¨. Remade by an inferior version by Michael Christofer(2001) with Antonio Banderas Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson full of erotic and lust scenes. ,positive
 This film is great - well written and very entertaining. David Duchovny shows once again that he is much more than Fox Mulder and the performances by the old men are funny as can be. Old married folks (like me) will appreciate the connection between two hearts. ,positive
 Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate. How insane the world is and the power of will and friendship love and passion. A must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever! Many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this!! ,positive
 Taut and organically gripping Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle. Bivouacked in Washington DC a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan drunk and belligerent beats their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum who's assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper) who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to insure his silence before Young closes in. Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan naturally does his prototypical Angry White Male (and to the hilt) while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role however is not central); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack who's leeched into her life Paul Kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorable. The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but it's pretty much confined to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit). At least there's no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and...). Curiously Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer). But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general the specifics don't fit so smoothly. The victim's chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating Ryan's murderous rage. ,positive
 I like the film it´s the best pirate-movie I watched hitherto (forget silly Errol-Flynn-stuff and Pirates of the Caribbean). This movie is wonderful melancholic. I compare it with Johnny Guitar at the sea-side (but 3 years earlier) two women fighting for a man where mad love might lead one. The character of the female (anti-) heroine Anne Providence is superb acting without compromise like a child lost alone on her search for a own female identity in a real man´s world. She´s a quite strange movie-hero not a funny pirate as most of her companions in this genre not making jokes all the time fighting for the poor and good and only killing the stupid spanish or british soldiers or - better - sly governors but she´s murdering all the poor prisoners of war after she captured a ship (look careful at this at the start of the movie) she´s primitive (she can´t even read) she is desperated and she get´s an alcoholic she looses all her friends as consequence of her obstinacy and she´s wearing rags most of the film. This film shows a pirate hero a little (!) bit as he (or in this case she but there has been a female Anne buccaneer Anne Boney) might have been in brutal reality. The film is quite short and the story is told in a breathtaking manner. Certainly a film from the 1950s has no exciting special effects for present time viewers (the ships swim very obvious in a bath tube) but this real drama about love (that kills) trust betrayal revenge hatred and sacrifice drives one crazy. Maybe Anne is even supposed to be Judas Iskarioth and Jesus from Nazareth in one person being betrayed by her friend (the french LaRochelle) as Jesus; after being disappointed by the friend delivering him to a death penalty (as Judas); than getting remorse about this (like Judas who commits suicide according to the gospel of Matthew); and in the end sacrificing herself for the rescue of the beloved enemy (as Jesus). But even if you are not interested in this philosophical questions of guilt and atonement the film brings a lot of (cheap) action as sword fights and burning (plastic) ships for a very short one and a half hour. ,positive
 Tobe Hooper (fresh off mainstream success with 'Poltergeist') aims for the skies this time around. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's 'The Space Vampires'. The script by 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby) varies a bit I was told: the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by Earth a few weeks after the films release (so I've read). The story concerns a shuttle mission (commander by Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes by Earth. All goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. Looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too) in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow. A bit later the ship returns to Earth but no contact can be made by NASA and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. Upon docking with the Churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown. Soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. If you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well. Thankfully the Commander survives re-entry in the pod (crash lands in Texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed London dry of their souls. Tobe Hooper (of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (1974)) does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date. The production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. Production Designer John Graysmark (fresh off 'The Bounty (1984)') uses every bit of four stages at Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi' (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'Star Wars' (1977) manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck even maestro Henry Mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. In the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like nobody's business. That comes in hand as his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on his soul. Gorgeous French actress May doesn't have a heck of a lot of lines (were there more than ten?) but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of. Pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. Job accomplished and where do I sign up to be victim? I really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clichés and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is accounted for here: bats (their true form resembles a large bat) coffins {the stasis fields resemble these) transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything) massive sexual appeal (Miss May.duh) not to mention they even include the old standby stake-through-the-heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they didn't touch on was religion but I think that the vampires using the cathedral at the end as home base might just be a bit of a wink and a nod. In short (yeah right 800 words later) 'Lifeforce' is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles. The effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged (at least at the time) and horror and sci-fi fans engaged. 4 of 5. ,positive
 It is not surprising that this film was made by I'm at the time it was. I'm examined the early beauty and tragedy of Chosun Dynasty life in Seopyonje and delightfully explored a well-known Korean folk tale in Chunhyang and these comprised his last two films. What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon his 2002 offering is not presented in the pansori style of those previous two films. Nonetheless the experienced hand of I'm comes through. We explore together the life of a real person: a late nineteenth century Chosun Dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who because of that causes a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for would-be Japanese ruling colonials alike. The painter Chang Seung Up known popularly as Oh Won (performed magnificently by Choi Min Sik the famous star of Park Chan Wook's already legendary OldBoy ) becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. Contemporary Korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that he was so ostracized in his time. I'm's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. I'm is a master at capturing his country's past idiosyncrasies and in this film he almost outdoes himself. As expected in an I'm film the cinematography is breathtaking the editing is precise and the story is central. Plots are set against Seung Up family ties are tested and broken scandalous behavior is alleged (and is sometimes real) all to bring down the man who painted fire. But against all the intricacies of I'm's detailed but sometimes convoluted account of Seung Up's life Seung Up himself somehow manages to survive. He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off Oh Won. In other words lines of people who wish to take advantage of the real Seung Up an artistic star begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience if not the cast. What does Seung Up think? He possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished. He despises those who would try to turn art into profit. And he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals. Horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I'm's signature historical epic motif and his influence in the realm remains on prominent display in this multi-million dollar epic. The protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning one that is not just political but social in nature. I'm takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion. He Oh Won becomes a Jesus figure. The people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be. Eventually both government and people come down upon Seung Up in a manner taken straight out of the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for (or escapes from) the sins of the commoners the art critics the politicians who hound him. But does he die? As with most of I'm's films a question remains. In this case does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not tackle that question; it merely presents a possible end for the real man of Chang Seung Up or Oh Won. No death is depicted because no death is known. It is difficult to find fault with this film but I'm has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does it hardly surprises anymore. As usual for I'm's films the cinematography the editing and the writing are all first rate. It's a well-crafted film imbued with I'm's uncanny story-telling ability. Granted he may be best at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. Still the film contains stretches of this admirable art form and by the end viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great untold story. And they have because that precisely is I'm's gift. ,positive
 Well I don't know much about anything but I sure liked this film. In short it was creative humorous simple and heartwarming. In other words it was everything it set out to be. The story is set around a girl's first love (as the title suggests) and I certainly should warn you: expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here. I mean it is a children's cartoon. It's really just a simple story but it's told well and it holds your attention well. In the end: it's short it's funny it's cute it's simple it's good. ,positive
 God bless Joe D'Amato...I love Italian horror cheese (movie-wise ;)) sci-fi etc. This one admittedly was a bit harder to watch but another fun BAD movie. I like how people preface a negative review with I normally enjoy bad movies but... No buts this was a bad movie FOR people who love bad movies. It's one of my top bad movies. Miles O'Keefe was a poor man's Conan but oh what fun. Who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb a hangglider and a cheesy rubber monster? It's fine to hate this movie if you only like Hollywood drek like Titanic or Pretty Woman but if you truly I mean TRULY love bad movies check this one out. This is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beerbust or when you have a couple buddies around and looking for a little mindless fun. My rating 8/10. ,positive
 Walter Matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner Jack Lemmon from THE FORTUNE COOKIE to THE ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films - a female partner. This was Glenda Jackson the English double Oscar winner who demonstrated her comic abilities against Matthau's first in HOUSE CALLS and then in HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was slightly larger in both films because his characters were more central to the plots but the chemistry between them was quite good. If you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazily funny watch Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor! Never has sex been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view. Matthau's Charlie has just been widowed before the film began. He has only had one woman in his life - his wife. So now he's the eligible bachelor. He also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the film that show he turns his senility on and off - see the scene where he rams Richard Benjamin's car). Amos is up for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor for the post - if he wants it). However Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of self-esteem. One day Charlie notices Ann in the hospital. She has had a slight accident and is resting in bed but Amos has put her into a cage like apparatus (which Charlie remarks has not been used since about 1920). He gets her out of the device and soon is romancing her. She joins the staff of the hospital but she is critical of Charlie's willingness to cater to Amos and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital. Amos' bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital (Lloyd Gough) who owned a baseball team (his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers). Amos tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner delivering the eulogy at the burial service (the line in the summary above is the peroration line of the eulogy). However she is still determined to sue (her lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent he's ever seen). So Amos suggests that Charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit. But how will Ann react to this? The film is quite amusing and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for Jackson and Matthau it led to a television series as well. ,positive
 too bad they showed palm trees that could not be more inaccurate for Connecticut in October ... this was filmed in New Zealand ...This Martha Moxley case had been 'cold' for 20-25 years ... her family worked hard to keep it alive and when Mark Fuhrman decided he did not want to be remembered only for his involvement in the Nicole Simpson case .... which could have been deleterious to his reputation (if it already hadn't)... Anyway he followed along as the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the use of flashbacks we can see the relationships Martha formed .... Unattended boys coming of age without a mother around to help and a dad who was always looped ... Plus the fact that they portray the real Martha as if she were a movie star... she was a cute sweet girl next door type. Other than that the other characters were really great especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore who played as Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel respectively. They were good as well the costumers had to keep it all in the 70s look and back up to the 90s .... It kept my interest even when I caught on about the Skakel guy .... ,positive
 This movie is based on the true story of Iowa housewife Lucille Fray who got breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child. Realizing that the state would take the children away from her ineffectual alcoholic husband she devoted the last year of her life traveling around the state to find new homes for each of the children. A terrific script - which still holds up 20 years after it was first made. The grown children many of whom had not seen each other since their mother died in the late 50's were reunited on That's Incredible prior to the film's airing in 1983. Barbara Stanwyck won the Emmy for best actress in a TV movie or mini-series but during her acceptance speech she went out of her way to single Ann-Margret out for her moving performance. ,positive
 I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one. Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black ( Lethal Weapon/ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film. The cast in this film crackles. Genna Davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a LKG sequel. Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as her sidekick Mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks. If Baffles me how anyone could not like this film. It packs so many thrills and its so funny. The wisecracks in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later. In my mind the first Matrix film and the Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90's. Incidentally Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny. It's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance cause they would have witnessed Renny Harlins best film and Genna Davis like you have never seen her before. Long live The Long Kiss Goodnight !! ,positive
 Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria. However three things complement the story making this an extremely good movie. First the actors use the actual languages of their roles. The Russian soldiers speak only Russian; the Hungarians only Hungarian; the Germans only German except to the minimal extent to tell the story. Since Debra Kerr is English she speaks only English and of course Yul Brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English. As a result the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when he/she cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them. Very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages the audience is never at a loss for following the film. No subtitles are necessary. Second. I was in Hungary in 1995 and I'm telling you this movie has it right on. From the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes the realism is incredible. If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie I ate at its double. I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village. (Actually the film was shot in Austria). Third and most important this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified. Of course Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship so the Acadamy wasn't going to give him another one but that is the quality of the film. Don't miss this one. ,positive
 This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents and purposes THE best choice to ever direct a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman taking on three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (the slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the superb Christopher Walken). Perhaps the best entry in the series it has it all: complex themes complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out. The cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand-out is DeVito as the multi-layered Penguin. Here is a guy who is evil pitiable funny and perhaps most importantly scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants still sends shivers up my spine. In other words the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances. I do not hesitate to say that Batman Returns is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action then please check out this badly underrated film. If nothing else it's at least the best film Tim Burton has ever made. ,positive
 I watched this on tv in 1989 and regretted not taping it. I was very intriguing and suspenseful. It is amazing as the events unfold and this man's past catches up with him. The acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims... twist of fate ... but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie. ,positive
 It's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those loopy John Cusack comedies made by Savage Steve Holland and while I prefer there other more bizarre out-there flick Better Off Dead it's hard for me to dislike One Crazy Summer a movie I grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens. OCS was a follow-up to Better Off Dead returning Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from that film. Cusack is Hoops following graduation pal Joel Murray(George)to Nantucket for the summer to each some fun on the beach. Hoops finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde buff punk named Teddy Beckersted whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. One of the homes needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to Demi Moore(Cassandra). There's a sailboat race which might be their only hope of saving Cassandra's grandfather's home(..he had recently passed) but it has been won by Teddy over the past many years and Hoops is deathly afraid of boats over water. But with the help and motivation of newfound Nantucket friends(..such as Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as auto-mechanic twin brothers!) George and budding love-interest Cassandra perhaps Hoops can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. Armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky manic weapons salesman General Raymond(..SCTV's Joe Flaherty in an inspired bit of casting) Ack who uses the training from his father to assist Hoops and company in their goals to win the race. Memorable scenes include Bobcat getting stuck in a Godzilla suit(!)running rampant across an entire model of Aguilla Beckersted(Mark Metcalf barely recognizable as Teddy's rather unhinged pops)'s condominium Hoops being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid George a victim of toxic flatulence Bruce Wagner's nutty Uncle Frank's increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show and the wonderful Billie Bird as George's grandma who actually bills the group after a meal! Jeremy Piven as(you guessed it)a brutish jerk who associates with Teddy and causes trouble for Hoops and his posse the yummy Kimberly Foster as Cookie(..Teddy's girl who attempts to make-out with Hoops while he attends a luncheon with his father) and the one-and-only William Hickey as Old Man Beckersted who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race. Demi Moore is cute but this is Cusack's vehicle though Bobcat and Villard steal most of the scenes their in. Again some delightful animation from Holland are sprinkled throughout the movie(Hoops is an artist appropriately). If you like his movies I highly recommend the underrated How I Got Into College. ,positive
 In the light of the recent typhoon that hit the country hard (that is typhoon Ondoy) I thought it upon myself to re-watch Black Rain (1988 Japan) Shohei Imamura's haunting black-and-white masterpiece on the destruction and after-effects of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in the closing period of the Second World War. The destruction and impact of both catastrophes (war and typhoon) may differ in degree and quality but the trauma and scar (physically and psychologically) nevertheless are still there. It is a testament to a film's power that its images remain as potent and as indelible as when they were first seen. It is only that the difference now in my case is that watching those images has assumed a greater sense of poignancy and potency due to a first-hand experience of a near-monumental weather calamity. There is a sense of kinship so to speak. Imamura has always been one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always a pleasure to watch because of their anarchy sensuality and earthiness: The Pornographers:Introduction to Anthropology (1966) Eijanaika (1981) Warm Water Under a Red Bridge (2001) his two Palme d'Or-winners Ballad of Narayama (1983) and The Eel (1997) to name some. Given the mood of his films who would have thought that he once served as an assistant director to Yasujiro Ozu Japanese cinema's most austere and minimalist filmmaker? But then it is Ozu's rigorous formality and domesticity that Imamura was rebelling against. But then again with Black Rain one can unmistakably sense Ozu's imprints. The father (or the father-figure) being intent on seeing his daughter get married before time runs out on both of them and the stillness and calmness of the scenes showing all members of the family together (notably the dinner scenes or in Ozu's film lexicon the tatami) are something that the revered master filmmaker would perennially explore in his works ( Tokyo Story Late Spring ). Essentially the over-all subdued and deliberate quality of Black Rain is a remarkable contrast to the bacchanalian chaos and instinctual drive of Imamura's entire filmography. Still this is not to say that watching the film would not be an altogether unsettling experience. Black Rain as aptly described by American film reviewer Leonard Maltin is filled with haunting black-and-white images. In the film's first 15 minutes Imamura pulls no punches in showing the immediate and graphic horrors of the nuclear bombing one after another (stiffly-burnt bodies hanging flesh walking dead fires and debris everywhere madness all over). An assault to the viewers' senses definitely it is coupled with Takashi Kawamata's somber b/w photography (he did the lensing in Yoshitaru Nomura's crime drama The Incident ) and Toru Takemitsu's chilling score (he did the music in such classics as Akira Kurosawa's Ran and Masahiro Shinoda's Double Suicide ). Even during the film's supposed tranquil phase (that is five years after the atomic bombing) one can still never have a sense of contentment and order with the uneasiness and pain still being strongly felt by the survivors not only in terms of failing physical health but more so in terms of psychological trauma and social stigma. The human race it now indisputably appears has been destined to bear the legacy of the Bomb for as long as it lives. I already wrote a piece about Black Rain some years earlier (posted in IMDb.com) but only in comparison to Volker Schlondorff's magnificent Tin Drum another film dealing with monumental human folly and global catastrophe. Moreover it has never been my practice to write twice about a film that I already wrote something about before. It is in the light of the recent weather calamity that devastated our country that I was prompted to re-visit and write something again about this remarkable Imamura film as there is a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the film and the recent event in regards the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action and the long-term scars and wounds inflicted by a wide- scale destruction (whether human- or nature-induced). There have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction ( Testament Threads The War Game each situated within their own respective countries);and Black Rain stands among them if not more so for both its unapologetic and somber portrayal of individual and communal disintegration brought about by atomic devastation and the fact that it has a historical event as its basis. Few weeks from now another disaster film from Hollywood Roland Emmerich's 2012 will finally hit (no pun intended) the big screen. As we all know this American director's bunch of disaster/apocalypse films-- Independence Day Godzilla The Day After Tomorrow -- serves no other purpose than to be of mere entertainment value with no real insight into the nature and wisdom of apocalyptic disaster and the human condition being affected. I wonder how this gigantic movie would exploit the trauma disorientation and apprehensions still being experienced by our people because of the recent weather calamity. To say that this flick is a precautionary tale would probably be no more than an overstatement. But yes I will still watch 2012 . ,positive
 The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes. Set in Bengal in the early 1900's the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. An educated and beautiful woman Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society. The film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of her depth in portraying Binodini's strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness. Binodini's idealism does not come across and as a result the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried. ,positive
 L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy and it's honest realistic and refreshing. Not a comedy or drama but more a slice of life movie about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in Barcelona for one year. Beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack. If you're older this movie should bring back a flood of good memories. If you're young learn by this example. ,positive
 I saw this at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in NY and it was very warmly received. In this pre-WW2 film a pair of German rocket scientists are working on the Scottish Isle of Scarp as war looms on the horizon. The characters encountered on the island are priceless in their creation and their portrayal. Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable After getting up to speed on the Scootish accents the viewer feel right at home with these folk who watch with amusement as the Germans work to link their isle with the mainland via a rocket-based mail delivery. As implausible as it seems this film was based on an actual story. All in all a memorable film that will stay with you for some time thanks to its casting its story or its scenery. ,positive
 I saw this movie when I was very young. It is my all time favorite. I had been unable to obtain a copy until recently and viewing it brought back so many fond memories. I loved Sidney Poiter's portrayal of Porgy he his character with such strength and courage. Pearl Bailey's part although small was not unlike many of our own family members. My favorite songs were and still are Bess You Is My Women Porgy Don't Let Him Handle Me and of course Summertime.

 It has been recorded that John Ford made the big blockbuster movies so that he could afford to make the small movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master with a young Ben Johnson is clearly one of his best if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting the wagons the intricate work with horses and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films Eisenstein the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film. The supporting cast including Ward Bond Russell Simpson and Jane Darwell are excellent as well as the many minor character actors Ford used including his brother (the one who plays the drums). While Ben Johnson went on to win a well-deserved supporting Oscar for The Last Picture Show his co-star Harry Carey Jr. did not reach those heights. Although his father Carey Sr. became a western leading man in Ford's early films Carey Jr. spent most of his career in supporting roles. For fans of John Ford and for fans of western films this one is a must. ,positive
 National Velvet tells the story of Velvet Brown a young English girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse into competition at the prestigious Grand National horse race. The film follows her as she trains her horse with the aid of a former jockey and the support of her parents. While National Velvet is a family film that fact shouldn't deter anyone who typically views such films with derision. The film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family not just attention-addled youngsters. It even managed to land five Oscar nominations hardly a sign of slacking off for a general audience. Anne Revere in the part of Velvet's mother actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was indeed excellent in the role but it is 12-year old Elizabeth Taylor who steals the show. She is a charming presence and exhibits a talent beyond her years. Also on board are Oscar-winner Donald Crisp as Velvet's father Mickey Rooney as former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of her earliest film roles) as Velvet's older sister. The film's lustrous Technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while the editing secured the second of the film's two Oscars. Additionally the film was nominated for its direction (by Clarence Brown) cinematography & art direction. The score by ten-time Oscar nominee Herbert Stothart is also worth mentioning though it went unnominated. All in all National Velvet is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating. I realize that the prospect of watching a film about a girl and her horse isn't exactly going to thrill some people but this one is worth taking a chance on. ,positive
 The movie is more of a mockumentary of corruption in the whole American system. The correlations of those who vote who do not matter is so proved in the machines that end of voting a comedian to the oval office. Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughed at for years around the world. Bushism's have become a way of life for Americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office none to soon. Oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end. The story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs it ain't happening. Leaves a lot for thought. Overall I enjoyed it. ,positive
 In Victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and they are sent to live in the country. The children adapt to their new situation make friends and enlist the help of a kind old man they wave to on the train to help reunite their family. Actors who direct movies are often not very good at it. Jeffries however the great veteran actor of dozens of British comedy classics is one of the few exceptions. His brilliant conception (he also wrote the script from the novel by E. Nesbit) of a classic British children's story is what raises this film to art. Whilst the story may be highly idealised the wonderful performances and the fabulously evocative Yorkshire dales settings combine to make a truly memorable movie. The photography by Arthur Ibbetson is the definition of good movie-making - not a shot is wasted in telling the story but at the same time the images combine to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere. Agutter is simply perfect as the kind-hearted Bobbie (okay I fell in love with her at an early age but I defy anyone to disagree) and Cribbins whose comic acting pedigree is on a par with Jeffries is unforgettable as Perks the humble-yet-proud railway porter. This is a film out of time; romantic charming hugely enjoyable and with a beautifully naive sense of good-hearted kindness towards all. ,positive
 The premise is rather original and well thought-of but unfortunately siding a good story is very low budget that doesn't even allow for decent special effects. Jeff Fahey does his best amongst a poor cast as does the always beautiful Linda Hoffman. They should make more movies together. The movie while not worth much praise warrants at least one viewing. ,positive
 I walked into the movie theater with no expectations for the film I was about to witness Everything is Illuminated . I walked out with a joy I have barely come to feel with American films. The directorial debut of actor Leiv Schreiber the film follows a man on his journey through the past accompanied by an eccentric group including a brake-dancing barely English-speaking punk from the Eukraine his grandfather who believes he is blind and their crazy dog. The first half of the film is funny and smart with an extremely European flavor in the usage of small but wonderful characters while the second half of the film descends into a somber story of discovery and the holocaust. This little movie brings out so many emotions and so many colors with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of illumination but also of relationships and connections. The acting is incredibly powerful the story mysterious and interesting and the artistic appeal of the cinematography to die for.

 This short was nominated for an Academy Award losing to Anna and Bella. Not since Doctor Strangelove has nuclear war been so hilarious! Condie takes a situation and turns it on its ear and then gives it a spin for good measure. Visual gags abound in Condie's work and I always see something I missed before every time I watch this. On The World's Greatest Animation well worth seeing for thisand many other shorts. Recommended. ,positive
 Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley Chuck Berry Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst. This easy to watch bio is not without flaws. Some situations events places and even names were not correct for various reasons. What makes this movie so believable is that Gary Busey did his own singing in the part of Holly. A well produced soundtrack became a multi-million seller. Busey was nominated for an Oscar. Other stars of note are Don Stroud Conrad Janis Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine. ,positive
 Shwaas is awesome ! considering that the producers had a meagre budget they have done an excellent job. It is a must watch. The small kid has done an excellent job with a lot of emotions flowing through his eyes. Grandfather is at his best. The photography is superb. Technically correct and very creative. It helps in adding a lot of emotions to the mainstream content. The movie will keep u engrossed and don't be surprised if you are shaken after the movie and the story lingers in your mind for a few days.I sincerely hope that they make it to the final Oscar nomination Enjoy and again don't miss it ,positive
 Early 80's creature feature concerns a long abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to check out. Naturally they find no gold down there but one very hungry monster that slithers along in search of prey. While I have to be honest and admit I found it dull at first (I personally prefer the thematically similar The Boogens ) it actually grew on me as it went along. Now the characters aren't too interesting nor the actors either. The closest to an interesting character is Morgan played by Keith Hurt. In any event female lead Terri Berland is quite good looking and Rolf Theison makes his domineering jerk an easy person to hate. The writer played by effects man Mark Sawicki wears thin quickly. It begins in a comfortably predictable enough way with a nighttime set piece in which two victims are claimed to get things off to an acceptable start. The monster itself is intriguing for its design (as you can imagine it gets revealed a bit at a time until late in the game) and for being the product of stop motion animation when this process was no longer used very much. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (directing under the pseudonym of David Michael Hillman) and crew deserve some credit for their creation of atmosphere. They manage to make the film look quite claustrophobic and gloomy and their use of lighting works well. The film does build in intensity towards a pretty good ending. Suffice it to say they do the best they can on their low budget. An obscure little item worth looking into for die-hard horror buffs. 7/10 ,positive
 'Sleight of Hand' is my favorite Rockford Files episode of the entire series. This episode shows a side of Jim Rockford that is usually ignored. To wit Jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to her young daughter. The woman is recently divorced and she and Jim have recently returned from a weekend getaway along with the youngster. Through a strange turn of events the woman is discovered missing after they return to her home. Rockford's recounting to his father Rocky of the events leading up to the woman's disappearance is reminiscent of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer series from an earlier era. After much brooding and reflection and with Rocky's encouragement Jim stumbles upon the clue that sends him off investigating the disappearance with his usual steadfastness. Unfortunately Jim's girlfriend Karen unwittingly witnessed some mafia activity while they stayed at the Buena Vista Inn. The crime bosses responded by killing Karen and substituting another woman into Jim's car. The imposter ostensibly asleep in the back seat made her exit immediately upon arrival at the home. A couple of cover up murders ensue and Jim proceeds to their solution while under suspicion of the L.A. police department even as warrants are issued for his arrest. This episode evokes more emotional reaction than all other Rockford Files episodes combined. James Garner as Jim Rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment and yet he retains the presence of mind to pursue the case. This is personal for Jim Rockford. In this case he is not hired to do a job but he is trying to recover his lost love to save her life. Unfortunately this is not possible but Jim tries hard to sort out his feelings but it is apparent that he will not soon get over his hurt. Despite the appeal of the main story line many key questions are raised but never answered in this episode. (1) What becomes of the young daughter of Jim's girlfriend? (2) What did Karen actually see at the hotel that made the mafia kill her? (3) How could Jim drive for hours with an imposter in his back seat without noticing this? (4) The daughter stated that Mommy didn't come back with us . So why didn't the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent for the hours long car ride? Regardless of these ambiguities 'Sleight of Hand is the Rockford Files episode which comes closest to being a tear jerker. The suspense is compelling and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style which makes us feel Rockford's pain. ,positive
 I just saw Mar Ardentro and felt that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes distort the true value of a movie. Many people have raved about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery/camera-work. Certainly Javier Bardem is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes. To say that he encompasses the real Sampredo is a little silly since I don't think that any of the reviewers have known Sampredo personally. To lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed doesn't constitute a 'perfect' performance. Bardem just does what he does well...and that's it. The camera-work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself lacks to deliver. Sampredo here is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that he leaves his loving family behind and marries a woman that he only seeks out when the other will not help him in his quest for a dignified death. Now I'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. The problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it. The movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter. I find it a weakness for the movie -unintentionally- portrays Sampredo as a unsymphatetic character. Someone who is much smarter then his family as portrayed in the simple cousin that doesn't get the double layered poem directed towards him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE thinks his life is undignified. A scene that is juxtaposed to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the wrong choice ending up in a far state of dementia thus indicating that Sampredo's choice was the right one. The woman that constantly seeks him out is almost disregarded for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by Sampredo when she agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo into a calculated figure no matter how charming Bardem portrays him. Argumentive I would say it doesn't convince fully and I kinda think that Amenabar didn't intend on adding this unbalanced element in his film. For a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo for instance). The camera-work IS impressive and the film is well acted. But 10 out of 10...no the movie doesn't reach that excellence. ,positive
 This movie is important to those of us interested in western history because it makes use of authentic techniques in its production. The scenes of the wagon train are particularly authentic; so far as I know it contains the only scenes ever filmed illustrating the techniques for river crossings at a bluff. The horses and mules have to be lowered to the river level and the wagons let down by ropes and pulleys. The scene is such that I could watch it over and again just trying to get a feel for what a crossing was like...and the early travelers did it time and time again while crossing the country. Melodrama aside this picture is as authentic in dress and style as they come and worth watching for that alone. ,positive
 As a zombie fan I really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters! PB is also an excellent tie-in to Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness. There are so many metaphors in the story! Riddick is this bad guy but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow-paced folks. The Muslim guy Imam relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day prayers but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule. Overall I recommend this film to any sci-fi fans. You won't be disappointed. ,positive
 This film has not been seen by me in quite a few years. It came on the Disney Channel in the wee hours of the morning. I stayed up to watch it and found it even more entertaining than the first time. The story the scenery and the characters are as good as they come. I know that if anyone takes the time to view this film they will find it definitely worth seeing a second time. It's very memorable in more ways than one. I would recommend this film to anyone because it is both entertaining and educational for all concerned. s ,positive
 Sony Pictures Classics I'm looking at you! Sony's got the rights to Harry records -- you need to distribute the film and you'll get radically increased sales of his back catalog! Anyhow this is a great study of a fascinating musician woefully underknown full of great stories greater music and it could have been 3 hours longer and I'd have loved it even more. Saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica where it played to a packed house. They were turning people away at the door! I went to many of the Mods & Rockers festival films and let me assure you that no other film came even close to selling out let alone turning people away. See it in the theatre buy the DVD and make sure some slow-on-the-uptake company [*cough SONY cough*] picks it up ASAP! ,positive
 When Melville's Pierre; or The Ambiguities hit bookstores in 1852 his first publication since Moby Dick a year earlier the public response was similar to that found among the IMDB reviews of POLA X . Newspapers even published headlines like: Melville Insane! which of course he wasn't. But when one compares the writing styles found in Moby Dick and Pierre one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former. Clearly he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now-forgotten Victorian Romances that were easily outselling his immortal Moby Dick. He was not content however to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted and that surely would have sold. His version of a Victorian romance was a twisted cynical one perhaps but brilliant in its synthesis. The alternate title: The ambiguities is quite appropriate. As Pierre searches for and thinks he finds truth we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe. As he searches for happiness he becomes more and more miserable. POLA X is a fascinating adaptation of this novel set in modern or nearly modern France. Though in some ways it leaves little to the imagination and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that Melville could only hint at the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are perfectly in tact. The questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask yet the answers are left to the viewer. I recommend a reading of the novel which is much shorter than Moby Dick before seeing this movie. I hope more people discover this tantalizing film. ,positive
 Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then to the current movie. When Ray Charles was little he went blind and his mother didn't baby him. She was a strong woman who didn't treat him any different because he was blind. She made him do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later on in life. His mother also sent him to school as well. Then when Ray Charles became a man he could stand up for himself and take care of himself but there was a downfall into narcotics sex and betrayal. When I am discouraged about something I can just think of this movie and it will inspire me. ,positive
 I hadn't planned on leaving a review but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie I had to say something. I'm not going to give away the ending or anything but I do give away some important plot points in this review so you should be aware of that. The short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both kick butt in this movie and it's a lot of fun. Watch it. This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Geena Davis is perfect as the action heroine torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother and the memories that are resurfacing of her former life as a CIA Assassin. Her performance is superb as she plays both facets of this relatively complex character perfectly. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is as always also excellent as the Private Investigator that Geena Davis' character hired to look into her forgotten past. He does a great job of playing the unwitting sidekick to Geena Davis' tough character. Some of the lines he utters in this movie are the best he's ever used in any movie he's been in. Seriously if you haven't seen it do. It's a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists and turns and it's extremely well directed and acted. ,positive
 This is an excellent movie and I wish that they would put it out on DVD for people to purchase. It is difficult to try to catch it on TV all the time. As you do not know when one of the stations will decide to air it. Can someone tell me what file company make it so I can write to them and see if they will release it to the public? I only caught the last hour and a half yesterday and I only got to see it once last year. My sisters and I are all looking for it in every store that sells any videos. John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great. They put out some much older movies and I think that is great but there are quite a few that they have not put out and I think if we could contact the producers and voice our requests we might get some of them put out on DVD. ,positive
 Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes/Rififi(1955) can on the surface be described as a French variation on John Huston's seminal heist film Asphalt Jungle(1950). The difference between the two films is Rififi(1955) pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence. Also the police aren't involved in the aftermath of the robbery in Rififi as much as in Asphalt Jungle. In the end Rififi(1955) is in my opinion a slightly better film than Asphalt Jungle(1950). Remarkable Noir picture that defines 1950s French Cinema. Spartacus(1960) may have been the one which broke down the infamous blacklist but in my opinion Rififi(1955) was the film that began to break apart the unbreakable Hollywood blacklist. First film in five years for Jules Dassin who was victimized by the McCarthy communist hunt of the late 40s to early 50s. He got some sort of retribution when Rififi(1955) became a success around France and Europe. Thus defying the poisonious Hollywood blacklist in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same. Rififi(1955) is the most important film of Dassin's career because it not only restored his name but also gave him a second chance at making films. Jules Dassin gave the filmworld and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions. His handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless. Builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship. Dassin came full circle in the Film Noir genre by directing his best and last Noir Rififi(1955). Marked the end of Dassin's period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing Noir pictures. Rififi(1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director Jules Dassin. A masterpiece in acting cinematography directing editing and writing. Not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on. As brilliant as anything by Jean Pierre Melville who was a master of this type of film. Masterpieces such as Rififi(1955) are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in motion picture history. The one fascinating aspect of Rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the 118 minute duration. The main characters plan and execute the jewel heist in the same way a film director prepares for the pre-productions production and post-production of a film. Shows how difficult a Jewel heist like in Rififi(1955) is in committing and why very few would do something like it. The fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater. Close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picture. Lack of unnatural sound in the landmark thrity minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism. Any dialogue or/and music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create. The use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience. Now Filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream filmgoer's patience. Sustains a level of consistency that never once lets down. Maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection. The director achieves suspense in the heist sequence that's rarely equaled in most robbery scenes from heist films. Jean Servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting. Getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing. The robbery sequence of Rififi(1955) reaches a Hitchcockian level of suspense and tension. Many filmmakers from the years following Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes(1955) have been influenced if not inspired by it. One filmmaker influenced was Jean Pierre Melville(original choice for director of Rififi)who used variations of the heist sequence in Le Doulos(1961) and Le Cercle Rouge(1970). Another filmmaker influenced was Stanley Kubrick who made a similarly themed film in The Killing(1956). Also Quentin Tarantino whose debut feature Reservoir Dogs(1992) was inspired by this film. Other film directors influenced are John Woo Michael Mann Paul Schrader Ringo Lam etc... Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes(1955) is comparable to Bob le Flambeur(1955) in many ways. One Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville directed groundbreaking films in Rififi(1955) and Bob le Flambeur(1955). Two each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist. Three Bob le Flambeur and Rififi finishes in fatalistic fashion. Four each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film greats. Part of Rififi's charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as Tony le Stephanois Jo le Suedois Mario Farrati and Cesar le Milanais. Most of the violence is implicit yet effectively brutal. The main characters led by Tony le Stephanois abide by a strong outdated code of honor that is remindful of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo. Jean Servais becomes the role of Tony le Stephanois with his cynical outlook and tired looks. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes/Rififi(1955) became a favorite of mine the moment I saw it on the big screen from beginning to end. ,positive
 Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this. If he weren't so dumb he'd know it REALLY is duck season and just blast Daffy. But poor old Daff can't believe the utter preposterousness of the situation. His cruel plans of misdirection have been foiled by Elmer's dumbness. Daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with Elmer to be blasted in his living room. Poor Daff. He rules! ,positive
 I rented this movie for two reasons. The first was all of the good things that I read about it. I definately was impressed and couldn't agree more with all of the reviews I read. The second reason is because I know these guys. I don't know Mark as well as I do Mike. He hasn't changed much from the years we knew each other. I know him as the reaper from a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE). The way he is in this film is genuinely Mike 100%. He once gave me a table that he made. It was a little one about 15 high that said Metallica on it. The odd thing about it was it only had two legs. Sometimes it's the thought that counts and Mike always has thought about others first. ,positive
 In my opinion National Velvet is one of the top family classic's of all time. It features Mickey Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). Velvet wins a race horse named (Pie) in a raffle. She falls in love with it right away. With the help of Mi an ex-jockey they train it to race in the Grand National's. After the jockey who was scheduled to race Pie backs out at the last moment Mi convinces Velvet to take his place. This was a well put together motion picture. Fine storyline and top notch acting. The inner play between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family picture expertly Directed by Clarence Brown. The photography is stunning. This is a movie you will enjoy for years to come. This picture is what made Elizabeth Taylor a household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth remained close after the film. They still send post cards to each other after all these many years. One side note. Elizabeth loved the horse Pie so much that the studio gave it to her. ,positive
 This Don Siegel/Clint Eastwood strange and hypnotic drama was left by the wayside in 1971 and what a pity. A fascinating character study with some great women for Squint to deal with. Geraldine Page was one of our supreme actresses and she's perfectly cast. Young Jo Ann Harris is a flirty minx and Elizabeth Hartman (who died too young) is undeniably repressed. A 7 out of 10. Best performance = C. Eastwood. Released the same year as DIRTY HARRY this did no business beside getting some good reviews. Seek this out unless you're only into Explosion films. Very subtle and frightening this piece will stick with you. ,positive
 If you want to see what could be classed as the 'stage' version of GYPSY this is the film for you. If you enjoy(ed) listing to the MERMAN recording of GYPSY then you really enjoy watching MIDLER as Gypsy's mother ROSE. It's my opinion that Midler has the volume vibrato and presents that Merman once had. It's not often these days when listening to update versions of musicals that I get that tingling sensation that makes the hair on my neck tingle but Bette Midler certainly shows her talents in this movie -see how you like them apples..... I know you may not like it but for me Ms. Midler is the definitive Gypsy . ,positive
 Viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles. I give the nod to Garbo(but not by much)in regard to her naturalness. Robeson is majestic. But his performance is aimed for a large proscenium theater. Something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities. There hadn't been any films coming out of Hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like Anna and Brutus to take the foreground. These were very progressive films for their time. It's quite probable that O'Neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of America. ,positive
 One of the most charming and for me at least the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's enthralling Best Picture-winner The English Patient is that in the mid 90s when Hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects a film was created that brought back tracesvery powerful tracesof the sweeping wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and The Ten Commandments (1956). The English Patient contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all and fascinating characters with pasts and stories. The English Patient based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje is like The Godfather: Part II (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. It's a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient who has been scarred for life by a plane crash and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced troubled patient Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other. That's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one told in flashback is the patient's past before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever. To be blunt The English Patient is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate how obsessive how enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories such as Minghella's later Cold Mountain (2003) the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love but still because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion we can believe that there is a sure true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of Vertigo (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other. Performances all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Juliette Binoche who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe playing the sort of cynical questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing. And of course I can't leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers. Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I cannot glance over. Number one it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly in there but in the film it just seems a littledistracting and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me. I was far more interested by Fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses. Nevertheless these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside The English Patient is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. To me it was sort of like an insane mix up between Casablanca (1942) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) two remarkable and better films and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. For he was a truly gifted filmmaker. This is all the evidence anybody needs. ,positive
 I remember watching this series avidly every Saturday evening. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors I'm sure Robin and his men would have young after all people didn't live that long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robin's granddad). The only sad thing was the ending it's a shame they couldn't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending. ,positive
 Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops crackles hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding plot and character are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity. This is a part of a review: USA The Movie is emotionally intense intellectually intriguing and profoundly disturbing in surprising and unconventional ways. Dion Dennis PhD ,positive
 This film promises much but delivers little. The basic problem has to do with the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character in this film. Immigrants from Sicily did not need a redheaded Anglo in any way--the movie may have needed her but new citizens certainly did not. In my opinion the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie but also the history of immigration itself. Immigrants themselves were heroic figures fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what I believer to be a veiled image of the white man's burden. I wonder if someone will make a movie of Irish immigrants which will include a Sicilian woman as a major character. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of film--acting production sets dialogue artistry film continuity plot and character development--on a scale from high of 10 for excellent 5 for average and 1 for needs help. Both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. The continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending. Does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of Marc Chagall? The plot is simple enough until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the ending. The acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film and the inclusion of the Anglo-Saxon speaking perfect English almost turns the movie into a satire. Where's Groucho when you need him? The production sets the dialogue and the artistry are very good each rating a 10. The sets in Sicily on the ship and on Ellis Island are as good as one can find. The dialogue is marvelous and the ethic singing is superb. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that the immigrants speak of America not the United States --the ideal vs. the political reality. The are many good artistic scenes with dreams of America gold coins raining and giant veggies among the best. The average Left Elbow Index is 5.25 raised to a 7.0 when equated with the IMDb scale. One other notion seems to run through Ellis Island experience: the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling later in 2006 one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night no questions asked! The movie is worth seeing but it appears that what one sees is problematical. ,positive
 I've seen this movie twice on Transilvania International Film Festival(TIFF) the movie is in competition and I really hope that Esteban Sapir will get one of the awards (at least the best image award). As a silent cinema fan I'm interested in contemporary movies that quote or recreate the language of the yester-year cinema. The previous reviewer emphasized the quotes from Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see it the movie references directly Lang's Metropolis and the allegorical-parabolic character of his plots. But I didn't see Murnau in it. There's a more obvious Melies-homage though: the Moon with a (here cigar-smoking) human face and the paper-made painted mountains and city-landscapes. I enjoyed the film mostly for its visuals and in the meantime I found very interesting the story on muteness and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the voiceless city. From this perspective this movie is an unique reflexion on the muteness of the silent cinema because in the films of the silent period one can hardly find stories with mute characters. In this case can be questioned whether the story on the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form or there's an intention to play upon the muteness of the silent films. Another example of this kind of reflexion I found in Guy Maddin's Careful where the inhabitants of a mountain-village have restrictions in using their voices. I intend to write a paper on it if you know movies related to this topic please let me know!!! I highly recommend Esteban Sapir's film to every moviegoer (one of the critics called it: the jewel of the festival). PS: Winners were announced and the film won the award for best cinematography! ,positive

 I also attended the RI International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this film won best of show. SEA OF DUST is a wild romp of Horror Comedy and beautiful scenery. A back in time tale of strange goings on. An increasingly wide spread illness with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of people's heads exploding brings a young Professor's apprentice; Stefan to investigate. Along his travels he decides to briefly detour and once again ask for his long time love's hand in marriage only to once again be sent packing by her extremely stubborn father Along the way out of town he comes across an ill girl in the road and delivers her to Dr. Maitland (brilliantly played by up and coming Vincent Price like actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan in on the Evils a foot. Only the Dr. is insulted that he had called for the Professor and only received a boy in trainingNone the less Stefan turns out to be much more than a common bystander. Horror Icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious torment monger; Prester John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actors seamlessly held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax. Dark Religion and over the top but fun and sometimes very original gore scenes play heavily in this Hammer tribute flick. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks surreal worlds dreams and the character's reality. Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very Funny movie! Slapstick tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line. Like others have stated; this really is like three great movies in one. Very Entertaining and Original. ,positive
 Dope Sick Love is a really remarkable documentary made for HBO about two pairs of heroin addicted lovers roaming the streets of NYC. I managed to catch it one night by accident and found it absolutely mesmerizing. There is no narration and we never see any interviews with the subjects the camera just follows them around like a third eye completely detached. The people being followed don't even seem aware that they're being filmed! (or at least they don't seem to care). The footage is amazingly candid. Some of the most candid I've ever seen. This is as real as it gets. The nuts and bolts of what its like to be on the street and addicted to heroin. We watch them score dope shoot it make up hustle and even impersonate cops to rob people and about a million other tiny details that less observant documentary filmmakers would leave out. Some of the footage is truly horrifying. Like watching one guy frantically searching for fix he lost. I found myself praying that he would find it just so that his misery would temporarily end. And when he does find it the guy literally dances in the street. The cyclical nature of drug addiction becomes very apparent while watching this. EVERYTHING is about getting the next score to these folks yet the next score seems to be well worth the immense trouble they go through. I would love to get a copy of this if anyone knows where it is available. Highly recommended if you can catch it on HBO. ,positive
 It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film! But do! I expected nothing from this movie just something to pass the time but I was hooked from the start! Two interesting premises - A bank robbery gone wrong a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - How will these two stories collide? Just when you think you know what direction the movie is headed it does a 180 and you are left blown away by the great twists in the plot! It has a great but unexpected ending and you are left wanting more - always a good sign - rent it or even buy it you will not be disappointed! ,positive
 I am so impressed really. I expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else. OK there's a ton of pretty geeky humor. But the movie is so well done. The acting is quite good. The dialog while gamer cheesy at times I guess to cater to the gamer crowd is not bad at all. At times it's even dare I say great. When the female gamer who built this non traditional fighter type character rather then the usual (min/max) type gets all these additional attacks (seem right I did not check the rules ) it was cool. The sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production movie. The story moves right along. The transitions from game world to real world are well done. A male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female and sometimes by himself. Pretty clever I thought. The guy who decided to play a female but kept forgetting he was female was good for a lot of laughs. He even said tag at one point and the female walked on to play the role ( sorry I did not look her name up she did great though.) The guy always trying to get some got a bit tedious but I guess that was more gamer humor. There was just so much to like about the movie. Lighthearted. Fun! Very well done and I am saying that as a movie fan not a gamer (and I am not a D&D player.) As I said I expected SO much less. Movies often don't hold my attention I end up listening to them while working on my computer. This one held my attention. I can't give a movie much higher praise. ,positive
 A Slight Case of Murder is an excellent TV movie which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark the film is actually quite light hearted and funny with many memorable lines ( Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology and my personal favourite For next week answer these two questions about film noir What do these people do during the day? and Why is it always raining?). The film has a great supporting cast including Macy's real life wife Felcity Huffman James Cromwell and Adam Arkin. A must see for Macy fans! ,positive
 Having just seen this I find it hard to believe that it is not better known. This and the slightly-better-known but almost-as-shamefully-neglected COME AND SEE (Klimov 1986) must be two of the greatest war films. They are meaningful powerful incisive. THE ASCENT is also gifted with a sparingly-used but brilliantly trenchant score by Schnittke. ,positive
 Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A. in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again. The music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience. ,positive
 I'm a huge fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these films. The Assignment is based on a true story which has been somewhat embellished for the big screen and it really takes you on a fun ride. The film has a great cast starring Aidan Quinn Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. Naval Officer Quinn is a reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a chance meeting with Kingsley who believes Quinn to be the famous terrorist Carlos the Jackal. Because Quinn so closely resembles Carlos Sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him because Sutherland is obsessed with the terrorist's capture or death. The training sequences are awesome. Quinn is really put to the test by Kingsley and Sutherland having to withstand attacks from remote controlled snowmobiles from eating the same food each day to being drugged with a hallucinogen. He even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way Carlos would. The film has some great action scenes with Quinn eluding allies because they believe he is Carlos and in his final mission when he is to kill the jackal. Throughout the film Quinn must struggle with the new personality he has attained versus his own. Will he remain as ruthless and free as Carlos or will he once again return to his life of a good husband and father? If you like the spy genre this is a must see. The action is used only to propel the story of this thriller forward; no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes. Rating 10 of 10 stars. ,positive
 Historical drama is one of the areas where the British just can't be beat. So while i'm not a huge fan of the genre i can usually be persuaded to watch something lite this if it's British and with decent actors. I have never read anything by Sarah Waters which is of course something i should do. Hence i didn't really know what to expect from this. I had heard that there would be a lesbian love story but not much more. While watching it i found it to be a lot more interesting than i had anticipated. Without saying too much the twists and turns of the plot are unexpected as well as well-crafted. Although there were almost a twist too many somewhere it took me a minute to get everything straight. Production values are good the actors are very solid and the pace is decent although i found it to be a bit slow in the last half-hour. That might just be me though i usually have a problem with movies dragging on after the plot is more or less finished. All in all though this is a fairly enjoyable three hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas. ,positive
 Labyrinth of Passion --with the possible exception of Matador --is Almodovar's best film. It displays his unique personality at its best and least-censored before he started going more mainstream. Almodovar is just about the only modern director that can approach Preston Sturges' wonderful brand of lunacy. It's pointless to try and explain what the movie is about the real point being Almodovar's willingness and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity and sometimes of plausibility and taste as well. ,positive
 Throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the American C.I.A. can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind. In the beginning their objectives were simple: spy remove enemy agents steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. Years have elapse and although their mission remains similar their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying discrediting U.S. citizens and infiltrating American organizations who criticize the U.S. government. This movie however centers on the C.I.A.'s world manhunt for the infamous 'Carlos the Jackel.' The film is called The Assignment and tells the story Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn) a U.S. naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of the C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley) a special agent from the Israeli Mosad Ramirez is secretly trained to look pose infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real Jackel working for the Russians. This film is Explosively exciting and packed with wild chases killings and inter-country mayhem. Quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. **** ,positive
 this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it. such a smart comedy! very precise yet easy. the casting can not be any better. all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best and there is no stupid laughs or shouting through out the whole movie. layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly. the greatest of all is when the Village People's YMCA is cued in it brings out the importance of the Indian's statute which was only briefly brought up previously in the movie which makes the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies. I give it a ten especially a lot of times comedies are so underrated. ,positive
 Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are both superb in Johnny To's tautly directed crime thriller which puts most Western efforts to shame. Think of it as the Hong Kong 'Heat' only better! Everything about the film screams class; from the performances to the soundtrack the cinematography to the script. The tone remains serious throughout but the film has a nice line in black-humour friendship and romance at it's heart. Sure it gets a little preposterous later on but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who didn't find something to love about this movie. Thank God Hollywood hasn't (yet) re-made and ruined a classic. Do yourself a favour and see this film! ,positive
 I saw this movie awhile back and can't seem to track it down. Does anyone know where I can get a hold of it? I feel it is worth seeing again. I'm sorry to say I had never heard of Chloe Nicholle until this film. Yes she can act. When I first began to track this movie down I mistook it for another one of her movies Sex Spa. The plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversed. This is the first film I've seen Dru Berrymore. I looked up some of her other films and I feel she looks better as a blonde. I agree this is a good introductory movie. Not too soft. Not too hard. You got to start somewhere. ,positive
 The Beguiled is a strange work among Clint Eastwood's oeuvre. By 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies not only Westerns (the genre in which he first made his name) but also war films (such as Where Eagles Dare ) and cop thrillers (such as Coogan's Bluff ). Yet although The Beguiled takes place during wartime (the American Civil War) and was made by Don Siegel who had earlier directed Eastwood in Coogan's Bluff and was later the same year to direct him in Dirty Harry it is not an action film in the traditional sense. In most of his previous films Eastwood had played an active role but here his role is largely passive- his character Sergeant John McBurney is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive. Even while serving with his unit McBurney played no active part in the conflict; he is a Quaker whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms and was serving with the Union forces as a medical orderly. The film is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured McBurney being discovered by a young girl named Amy and brought back to her boarding school. The school is a small one with only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the Confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities the headmistress Martha Farnsworth decides to shelter him and tend him fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the Confederacy's notoriously harsh prison camps. Although McBurney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls and he wins the affections of number of them including Miss Farnsworth her assistant Edwina and Carol one of the older girls. Even twelve year old Amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him. In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred and Miss Farnsworth rejected in favour of the sluttish Carol plots a terrible revenge. (Interestingly the one female to resist McBurney's blandishments is Hallie Miss Farnsworth's black slave even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her). The Beguiled has been described as an anti-war film but this seems to me to be a misconception. The film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the Civil War or of war in general. The only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge not by zeal for the Confederate cause. It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war. At the beginning the school set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion seems like an island of peace amid the war. The building is in the Classical style associated with order harmony and restraint but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder passion and violence qualities associated with the Gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of Classicism. The film can be seen as falling within what has been called the Southern Gothic tradition in American film and literature. The film was not a great hit at the box office possibly because Eastwood was cast so much against type. It is not perhaps his best film but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes. (In Play Misty for Me his first film as director made the following year he was again to play a passive character in danger from a vindictive female). There are some very good performances from the female members of the cast particularly Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions. (There are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother). There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as the shy repressed Edwina who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of revenge and from young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy. (Amy is an animal lover- a key moment in the film comes when McBurney kills her pet turtle- so it is interesting that in later life Ferdin became an animal rights activist). The one character I was less keen on was Jo Ann Harris's Carol who seemed too modern like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s. The film is notable for the emotionally intense hothouse atmosphere which Siegel brings to it. This will not be a film which is to everyone's taste; some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic and some have found it misogynistic. (Judith Crist called it a film for woman haters and sadists ). Others however may find it a compelling psychological drama. 7/10 ,positive
 What can I say? I couldn't sleep and I came across this movie on MTV. I started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many anti-drug movies do but I got sucked into this movie and I couldn't stop watching. Nick Stahl did an amazing job with his character and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching. I was interested in purchasing the soundtrack to the movie (or even the movie itself) and MTV.com was no help at all but believe it or not Amazon.com is taking pre-orders for the August 5th release of the movie on DVD. I know I had a hard time tracking it down and I'm sure other people might have had the same problem. I'm buying my own copy so I can drool over Nick Stahl while bawling my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline! ,positive
 I think this is one of Burts top five movies along with Deliverance Smokey and the Bandit Boogie Nights and City Heat. He also directed this one so he had a talent for that too like his buddy Clint Eastwood. I wish he made more films like this or even a sequel to Sharkys Machine than the likes of Stroker Ace or Cannonball Run II. This is a tough gritty cop thriller with Reynolds at the top of his game. Having the beautiful Rachel Ward in it of Thorn Birds fame helped too. Henry Silva is the bad guy and he always does a good job at that. The film also a great soundtrack too. I highly recommend this wish it was on DVD in the UK an audio commentary from Reynolds would be great as well. ***7/10*** ,positive
 One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo a physically non-descript middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we're introduced to him at the start of the film he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo's cash tell him that 10 000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. This initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous . The first half of the film may be described as slow by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way the Al Pacino film Insomnia) Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though it's never explicitly spelt out the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare more La Vita è Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss world. ,positive
 A twist of fate puts a black man at the head of an old-school white-bred advertising firm. And he intends to make a few changes... One very strange piece of cinema. You'll either love it or hate it. Either way you've never seen anything like it. ,positive
 What can I say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here they pretty much sum up everything the people who love it cherish it the people who hate it... well they loathe it. This is the movie equivalent of Marmite. I personally have committed every second of it to memory it is cyclical claustrophobic introspective magical and stands as being one of the most unique films ever made. Despite what many have stated I believe this truly is a cult movie it is a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered once unearthed it's fantastical psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable which is an achievement in itself. One of my friends who watched it likened it more to a musical and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made would probably get more out of it to view Head as such. I was always fond of the Monkees especially the T.V. show back when it was repeated during the 80's. My mum had recorded Head for me when it was shown on T.V. late night as she knew I liked them I watched it a day later and it lodged in my memory until I was able to find a copy on DVD about 2 decades later what I would love now is a special edition it would be fascinating to get a greater insight into the making of this masterpiece. We can only hope. ,positive
 I was a schoolboy when I watched this film for the first time. The next day I knew that all pupils of our form watched it and all were fascinated by the film as I was. I think the same situation was in all forms of our school and in the whole Soviet Union. Later I watched it every time it was shown on TV and want to watch more. I think that comparison with Back to the Future or other Sci-Fi films is not appropriate. Gost'ya iz budushchego is unique in many ways once you have watched it you never forget it. This film is full of belief in peaceful science achievements full of belief in the beautiful future of our world. It's not only the film but also a forecast of many scientific inventions and achievements. The time shown in the film is the year 1984 (the year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where a schoolboy Kolya Gerasimov has traveled for some time and where his friend Alisa Seleznyova was from). The year now is 2005 many inventions and achievements predicted in the film are not realized yet. Such as Mielophone (a device which can read thoughts of any animal and human) expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as going for a picnic in the weekend) creating and launching of the satellites as a homework for pupils easy to drive flying machines (which completely replaced automobiles) biorobots historical identification of any kind of material or creature performed in a couple of minutes and many others. Meanwhile some of them nowadays became much more realistic than they seemed in 1984! Just wait for 2084 :-) The film also depicts typical Russian schoolboys and schoolgirls (and does it so naturally!). With their inventiveness curiosity humour dreaminess. Look for example at Fima Korolyov you could find such character in nearly all forms of every school of the Soviet Union similar character was in my form too! Alisa Seleznyova... I myself as well as many my classmates fell in love at first sight with her! By the way later an actress who played Alisa became a scientist - I think she was as much influenced by the film as people who watched it on TV. Beautiful idea beautiful realization beautiful actors beautiful music beautiful song Prekrasnoye Daleko ( The Wonderful Far-Away )... Beautiful beautiful beautiful... The last thing I want to say is that different remakes and new versions of the song from the film and even the film itself were made later and spread on TV and in the Internet. All they are not even comparable with the original. I should not even comment them my comment is only about the original. So request the original and enjoy it! ,positive
 Don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you. You'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes. However if for no other reason see Greystoke to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle Shakespeare; rather he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed. He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the part of the Sixth Lord of Greystoke his last performance is to be cherished by all who love the theatre. ,positive
 This movie is my all time favorite movie! It has great acting cute guys and a great plot. Sean Astin is great in this movie! It has funny moments sad moments and happy moments. Who could ask for anything more? This movie is GREAT! ,positive
 I will always think of Mr. Firth as Dorian Gray if I live to be 100. Perfectly acted and directed bringing Oscar Wilde's insight wit and humor alive with an absolute and utter perfection unusual in television. More proof that the BBC more than makes up in talent what it doesn't always have in money. A must have for all Wilde fans-and indeed for everyone else. Inspired and perfected every one of the actors looked exactly right for the role and every shot was well done. By the end I found that I loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired. Watch it then try to watch another version. It's just not the same is it? ,positive
 This is my all time favorite Looney Tunes cartoon. It's a common plot: Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd that it is really rabbit season and shoot Bugs. But your can never outsmart that rabbit! In addition to usual cartoon comedy this cartoon is supported by great word play that will keep you rolling on the floor. ,positive
 It's just one of those films you're either love it or hate it my girlfriend and me loved it told my brother to rent it and he hated it said it was too flashy and colloquial then again he only usually goes to see big action movies so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. There were some great new talent (I'd never heard of the leads before anyway)? Des Brady (the directors brother?) was especially good. Playing a right dick at the start I thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end I was really routing for him. A very surprising film with a whole lot of heart if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original. Yashimo. Brixton in the UK. ,positive
 The war at home is a splendid television series and I don't understand because she has been annulled. Please fairies something to continue with this very beautiful television series with excellent and marvelous actors good recitation and good situations please we want the third series and even so many new episodes. I pray you!!!! I would like if possible somehow to make to reach this and mail the interested forehand since I can tell you that here in Italy this series is very liked as in other countries of Europe chest of drawers for example Spain. In effects as I have written above what strikes of this television series it is the good recitation of the actors and also the honest one with which numerous matters of true importance are treated. I think both one of the best American television series arrive on the Italian screens in these last years.I pray you!!!! ,positive
 This great film never showed up in my town so actually I didn't have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80'es when I caught it on German television. I was expecting something of a disaster and found instead a well-acted grand western with superb location work. The tiny tube couldn't really damage it and there's almost not a dull moment in this 4-hour film so I hope to see it once again on the big screen. What a spectacle that would be! Don't miss it if you ever have the chance. Unfortunately the harsh treatment of Heaven's Gate at its opening ruined Michael Cimino's career and he moved from the passable ( Year of the Dragon ) to the boringly ludicrous ( The Sicilian ) and the screechingly dumb ( Desperate Hours ). ,positive
 Trey's favourite from the first run of Season 10 and also one of my personal favourites Manbearpig features the adventure of Al Gore before going on global warming and before the movie it was similar a adventure certainly Al Gore was also trying to aware the world about something that can change the Earth something really dangerous this time about something that is half man half bear and half pig Al Gore had only one thing in mind: to aware everyone of Manbearpig and to kill it! Al Gore here is more than hilarious everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can childish doing tantrums since nobody believes him but he is just a f****** demented bastard. Basically four kids are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore but certainly he don't have that in his mind there's not space for any other subject is just Manbearpig what concerns Al Gore. Those four kids are Cartman Kenny Kyle and Stan basically Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and the four boys were just playing in Al Gore's game never imaging that Gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill Manbearpig (hilarious scene- they are just children damned Manbearpig ). So at this part we have on one hand all the stuff with the rescue team who also feel sorry for Al Gore and on the other hand we have a little yet extremely hilarious Cartman episode and there are not surprises of the attitude of Cartman after he finds a treasure inside the cave certainly the whole stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick Cartman in both senses he is really sick for the boys and really sick for us. And in the end Al Gore does killed Manbearpig! This character is a fantastic one and I'm cereal! Terrific fun in this episode a highly re-watchable one. 10 out of 10 ,positive
 Jimmy Stewart was a real life pilot WWII flier and a one-star general in the Air Force and therefore a natural for how real pilots react when they fly. When you see the faithful recreation of the actual plane you begin to understand the real-life bravery and courage of Lucky Lindy when he flew the Atlantic solo in 1927! ,positive
 I would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing fun-filled thought-provoking movie. The absence of sex vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening. I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene but that's probably because I live a short distance from there. Even so this film could have been produced in any city; it's the theme that's so important here. I'm just grateful that Manna From Heaven dropped down on us. Try it...you'll like it! ,positive
 This was a movie that at the end I thought Now that was an enjoyable 2 hours! I hate spending around $20 (not including baby-sitting $$) for my husband and myself to have that It was OK feeling. I think I like Will Smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero. He was well cast in this. His character was very likable as was Kevin James'. There were several laugh out loud scenes. It's also a romantic movie so guys if you want to impress the lady in your life take her to this. Women will like it as much as any chick-flick but I wouldn't categorize this as one. There is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. I think that's one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. It has romance AND slapstick. I don't usually like slapstick that much but it wasn't overdone and I can't think of any those scenes that didn't deliver laughs. I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband said to me after it was over was I want to see it again!  ,positive
 I had the pleasure of seeing Saltimbanco live before seeing the video version of the show. While nothing can compare to actually being there the people behind the video did an amazing job of capturing the flavor the feel the sensation and so much more. The wonderful performances of Saltimbanco's stunningly amazing troupe are beautifully captured throughout. The video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself. A wonderful experience. ,positive
 Absolutely one of the 10 best music films Ever! A totally essential educational experience for any music fanatic--Especially young rock/punk fans today...understanding the beginnings of any particular artistic movement absolutely requires understanding the roots of the music as well as the mindset and musical environment of the times....not to mention the political and social factors involved at the time. And besides all that this documentary is flat-out rock-n-roll F U N !! Do Not Miss It!!! that said can anyone tell me when if ever the decline of western civilization ...part 1 ( Not part 2 the metal version) will be made available again..hopefully on DVD? ,positive
 In 1965 producer Kevin McLory -who owns a part of the Bond cinematic rights- associate with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) for making Thunderball the fourth film of the 007 franchise. The star is Sean Connery of course. In 1982 McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an independent Bond film. Never say never again (NSNA) is one of the two unofficial 007 films made outside EON (the other is the 1967 comedy spoof Casino Royale ). NSNA is a remake of Thunderball and stars the original Bond Sean Connery -who comes back to the role after many years of absence. The film is released some months after Octopussy with Roger Moore the 13th episode of the EON series. At the time press calls it War of the Bonds ... Both films are a big success in 1983 even if Octopussy earns more money at the box office. NSNA is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians -director Irvin Kershner who led The Empire strikes back Douglas Slocombe -cinematographer of Raiders of the lost Ark - and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr -who wrote The three days of the Condor - among others... The cast is excellent with Connery a then relatively unknown Kim Basinger Barbara Carrera Klaus Maria Brandauer Max Von Sydow Edward Fox... Although all that the film remains inferior to the original Thunderball . It lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real Bond movie: there's not the traditional gun barrel sequence there's not the James Bond theme M and Q are not played by the traditional actors... It's a copyright reason: EON only is allowed to use these elements. Briefly NSNA lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere. On the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and gorgeous. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He's once again wonderful in the role he's older but looks fitter and nicer here than in Diamonds are forever his last performance in the role of the British super-spy before NSNA. ,positive
 Very good 1939 film where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks he has committed a murder. Trouble is that the killer and Garfield's girl Ann Sheridan in a brief but good performance get killed while trying to elude the police. A crooked attorney persuades Garfield to flee N.Y. He lands in Arizona and meets up with the Dead End Kids.. They've been sent there by a funding program to keep them out of further trouble. Of course Garfield finds a new love interest but must conceal his identity as everyone thinks he was not only the killer but was the victim in the car crash. May Robson is fabulous as the grandma type running the place for the wayward youth. Claude Rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects that Garfield is still alive and pursues him when a picture is snapped of him in Arizona. The film really deals with Garfield's relation to the boys. While the ending is good you want to see Garfield go back to N.Y. to proclaim his innocence. ,positive
 Focus is an engaging story told in urban WWII-era setting. William Macy portrays everyman who is taken out of his personal circumstances and challenged with decisions testing his values affecting the community. Laura Dern Macy and David Paymer give good performances so also the good supporting ensemble. ,positive
 Canadian film-maker Ron Switzer delivers a solid non-stop thrill ride of relentless horror with the superb 1991 sci-fi film Science Crazed . A hideous monster takes revenge on his mother a police officer and tenants of an apartment building. Brilliant practical make-up and special effects designs create a truly terrifying monster especially when lurking through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment settings. The characters are developed beautifully with outstanding and surprisingly touching performances from an ensemble cast. Produced by Donna Switzer newcomer Ron Switzer also penned the film's face-paced script weaving together an engaging roller-coaster ride of twists turns and terror that keeps you guessing until the last frame. Science Crazed will no doubt leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended! ,positive
 When I saw this film it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had (mostly filled with robots) I can relate to Eledore's problems and I have a similarity to Shiro and this is a great film to watch (if you're a Goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). All in all watch it before it's out of print! ,positive
 This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. To know that this film is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer(Carl Crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue however it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a Psycotic maniac. As he was so selfishly/inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer. Every person that he lured back to his apartment he was attracted to and had feelings for and the reasons why he murdered them wasn't only for the thrill of killing them but because he couldn't cope with the fact of them leaving him. In the scene when he killed his first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what I noticed wasn't because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated with the idea of the guy leaving him. It was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his hobby - for both evil and emotional reasons. The scene when he was talking while crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to move out of her house did show that he did have love in his heart. One scene that I found quite spooky and strange was when a priest overheard Jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy back to his apartment and then phoned Jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change his mind on going home with Jeffrey. When the guy left the pub the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at Jeffrey. I also found that Carl Crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of Jeffrey Dahmer. His evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he massacred his victims were so real I was shivering in my seat. His facial expressions reminded me of the way Vincent D'onofrio (Private Pyle/Leonard) in the film 'Full Metal Jacket' looked just before he gunned-down the General in the toilet barracks. If your an emotional person I wouldn't recommend you to watch this film but if your not than go ahead and watch it. ,positive
 The last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was In Dreams. In that movie you didn't see insanity you were THERE. Now The Cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer. The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying. The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating most of this stuff has never been seen in film before. The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking. In fact it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs. You have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim while in The Cell you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim. However despite the unfortunately weak story The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller. None that have ever been made even come close to it. Also the film had good direction and was extremely well acted. Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances (he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 re-make of Psycho) and even Jennifer Lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career (the other being the great Out of Sight). Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to give it sufficient credit it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history. The Cell is an incredibly well-made film and it deserves to be recognized. ,positive
 Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: Captain Correli´s Mandolin just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in Blow -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay it was painful. But there were saving graces. The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic and Cage does have some (-- redeeming this is !--) musical ability. Next a superb performance by John Hurt (Cruz´s father the village doctor) of Oscar Callibre as well as by Irene Papas each as village elders as well as by Christian Bale (Papas´ son) among the village freedom fighters go far towards counter-balancing awkward performances (especially at the beginning) by Cruz and Cage. Nicely the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses but it´s teeth-gnashing early on. Finally the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed. John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as the Doctor makes this film worth seeing. The true test of a supporting actor/actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question and in this case it would most certainly not be... not even close. Entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar. See it if you haven´t. Rating = 3.5 stars (of five). ,positive
 Oh my god. Obviously when you rent or buy this you're not expecting to see a documentary on the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitats. You're expecting a visual feast of blood and gore and and maybe even a scare or two. well for those who are as sick and twisted as myself you won't find many scares but you'll come very close to urinating all over yourself in laughter. the catch phrases in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. The first time i showed this to my friends and colleagues was over 3 years ago but still we laugh our asses off and use the catch phrases. it's as addictive and funny as Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive/Braindead. From the opening scene's absolutely ridiculous dialog to the Splatter and Gore Department's finest works to the wondrous abilities of Ed the film cutter you will laugh and laugh again. As far as the visual feast of blood and gore oh yeah they've got it. And they're pretty damn good at it... The neck-bone's connected to the head-bone... This film also may have done the best nightmare/hallucination/totally effing nuts scene i have ever seen. and that one's not mean to be funny but man is it well done (and creepy.) Overall to anyone who is not against a bunch of blood and a damn good time IF YOU EVER SEE THIS MOVIE GET IT!!!! it's on Netflix i know that for sure. ,positive
 I don't know if it's fair for me to review this. I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence. I've never understood the movie industry making heroes out of mob members and cold blooded killers. When The Godfather came out I thought they had broken the mold but the decades have produced a series of well-acted mob movies with major stars and directors doing them. This one is obviously low-budget but it is certainly well done. At some point in all of these I feel like I want to take a shower. If such characters actually exist it is hard for the soul. I always intellectualize that humankind will rise above this sort of thing. This kind of crud has to be stopped. I hope the people that go to films like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious. I feel sort of the same way about slasher movies. Why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment? In fairness I am judging this on the acting and directing and for what it is it seems to work pretty well. ,positive
 Sorte Nula is the #1 Box Office Portuguese movie of 2004. This extreme low budget production (estimated USD$150 000) opened during Christmas opposite American Blockbusters like National Treasure Polar Express The Incredibles and Alexander but rapidly caught the adulation of the Portuguese moviegoers. Despite the harsh competition the small film did surprisingly well topping all other Portuguese films of the past two years in its first weeks. The film is a mystery/murder with a humorous tone cleverly written and directed by Fernando Fragata who has become a solid reference in the European independent film arena. Did I like the film? Oh yes! ,positive
 In April 1947 New York City faced an epidemic crisis. Eugene LaBar a rug importer arriving from Mexico had arrived in the city bringing with him the deadly smallpox virus. He stumbled off a bus complaining of fever and a headache and soon died in a Midtown Hospital but not before he had infected a dozen passers-by. The damage was already done; for the first time in decades smallpox stalked the streets of New York. The city's health authorities acted quickly to isolate sufferers and contain the virus enacting a free vaccination campaign that saw over six million New Yorkers immunised against smallpox. Thanks to their swift response the virus was contained with minimal casualties. The outbreak nevertheless must have left an indelible mark for several years later it was followed by two similarly-themed film noir thrillers in which doctors must track down a single contagious carrier in a city of millions: Elia Kazan's 'Panic in the Streets (1950)' and Earl McEvoy's lower-budget 'The Killer That Stalked New York (1950).' McEvoy's film unfolds in an unglamorous docu-drama style. Reed Hadley's narration sounds as though it was plucked straight from a newsreel reciting facts as if reading off the official police transcript. This technique does feel a little cheap at times but fortunately the narration is largely restricted to the film's bookends as well as providing some explanatory filler during breaks in the plot. The killer stalking New York in this story is not a rug importer from Mexico but beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes) who has just arrived from Cuba. Within days Sheila has two parties independently pursuing her: a treasury agent (Barry Kelley) looking to arrest her for smuggling crimes and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who have identified her as the source of the smallpox outbreak. As in 'Panic in the Streets ' an otherwise routine manhunt is given a heightened sense of urgency particularly when those in pursuit initially have no idea as to the identity or appearance of their suspect. 'The Killer That Stalked New York ' for the most part manages to sidestep its low production budget. Aside from a select few lines of dialogue ( we have to stop it! exclaims Dr. Wood at one point as though coming to a difficult decision) the filmmakers and cast members allow the story to unfold in a realistic engrossing fashion. Indeed in this regard the low budget quite possibly aids the film's intentions necessitating a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the outbreak scenario. Evelyn Keyes is excellent in the leading role showing obstinate resilience in the face of unimaginable torment; by the film's end she appears so brutally incapacitated by her illness that it's almost painful to look at her face. Aside from the virus Charles Korvin is the main villain of the piece as Sheila's greedy and adulterous husband who rest assured gets everything that's coming to him. And if all nurses looked like Dorothy Malone perhaps catching smallpox wouldn't seem like such a bad break after all. ,positive
 Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's Land of the Lost ) creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain) whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S.; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair. Moreover the game cast mug it up with infectious aplomb: the adorable Valerie Bertinelli as Brian's sweet fiancé Casey Norton Chuck McCann as klutzy crook Brooks Red Buttons as McCann's equally bumbling partner Bracken Jim Backus as evil CEO Mr. Gibbs Hermoine Baddeley as nice old biddy Ms. Foster and 60's AIP exploitation feature regular Larry Bishop as smarmy duplicitous suit Ken Sharp. Best of all the titular pooch is a cuddly delight: C.H.O.M.P.S. jumps through fences walls and windows with amazing agility performs acts of exceptional strength runs faster than a deer and even does a few nifty martial arts moves. A subplot about a hulking neighborhood hound named Monster supplies a few extra belly laughs (Monster is voiced by some uncredited guy with an appropriately deep growly voice). The groovy animated opening credits sequence Charles F. Wheeler's glossy cinematography and Hoyt Curtin's funky pulsating disco score are all solid as well. A cute little kiddie flick. ,positive
 Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart) she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia and flees in his car not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her. What Betty is chasing besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Only problem: Dr. David isn't real he's a soap opera character on the show `A Reason To Love' and he's really an egotistical actor named George McCord. To say any more regarding what develops would be too much but Nurse Betty is certainly original. Its hit men are like the hired killers of Pulp Fiction are violent yet philosophical its take on soap operas terrific spoof material and its acting is the best feature of all. This has to be one of the best cast films in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Nurse Betty with the constant gleam in her eye that pushes her in her quest. Morgan Freeman brings his constant state of grace to the role of a killer at the end of his career and Chris Rock is his partner a man of rage and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is at his comic best as the vain actor/soap opera doctor. There are also great supporting performances from actors such as Emmy-winner Allison Janney (The West Wing) Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasier's agent Bebe Glazer) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). Actually the supporting cast is a Who's Who of television best character actors. A unique film that is funny one moment and chilling the next Nurse Betty is a mix of great acting casting and a terrific screenplay. ,positive
 Two actors play rival gangsters in three films the final of which is a sci-fi film that nods strangely to William S. Burroughs Philip K. Dick and anime all at once. The robots are actually called replicants a reference to Dicks Blade Runner(several visual allusions to the film can be found as well) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for heterosexual love is fleeting and homosexual love is eternal ....martial arts fights ensue a first for the dead or alive films. The hilarious climax involves the two leads morphing into a winged robot with a gigantic phallus for a head who personifies destruction which has been the path of both characters thus far their individual minds and later literal heads functioning as something like testicles. The film ends with the mayor f*&%ing his free jazz playing boy lackey as the robot apparently tears down a wall around them the last words of the mayor Oh f*&% followed by a quick fade to black. Part of me felt cheated part of me confused but mostly I was just laughing. A lot of the film is quite boring though the best scenes bookend the film while the rest is far too slow. Takashi Miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films and this film with the exception of Gozu reinforces this theme more than any other. Sex and violence are two pretty basic themes but like Cronerberg(who the jazz interludes may be a homage to ala Naked Lunch)Miike is able to show where the two connect to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect. ,positive
 I remember seeing this in the early 90's on UK TV and was hooked. The international scope of the production is breathtaking and watching how the characters develop through the five hours it runs for is magnificent. The scenes set in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest and as a viewer you get a real sense of a grounds-eye view of the culture and vibe of these countries during the closing stages of the Cold War. The characters of Fazal and Helen develop really well throughout the series and rivals modern shows like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in this area. In the UK the VHS goes for about £6 and the DVD about £10 - a quality bargain. I thought Soderbergh's version was great too - but clearly owes this masterpiece a huge debt. ,positive
 ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL'S / (2001) *** (out of four) By Blake French: According to Harald Zwart the director of One Night at McCool's this film is a dark comedy about the power of women over men and how a group of people can all perceive different realities. It's the same story told from three different points of view and each time we tell the story we try to reveal a little bit more about what actually happened which nobody really knows. One Night at McCool's marks the feature film directorial debut of Zwart an award winning commercial and music video director who began making short films when he was eight years old. I always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to filmmaking. We have seen so many examples of how these guys think they are making another advertisement or music video for TV with their productions. Zwart resists that tendency. He captures a specific humorous truth in One Night at McCool's from an inventive complex screenplay by the late Stan Seidel even if it is often somewhat perplexing. One Night At McCool's features three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman. In some ways this movie is the comedy version of American Beauty but in others it is a world apart. It all started one night at McCool's explains each of the three men to their various listeners. There is Randy (Matt Dillon) a tender at the local bar and his cousin a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser) who stays until the place closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman) arrives when the saloon becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a female fatal appropriately named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her as an individual treats her unkindly. He stands up for her and before you can say SEXY they are having vigorous sex and she moves in with him. At first Randy is reluctant: The sex and the violence all in one night  it's a little much. But who could turn a jewel like Jewel away. Jewel changes the lives of each of the three men. For Detective Dehling she pulls him out of a hole of grief since his wife died. For Carl she makes him forget his loving family and nice little suburban household. For Randy she lights a few fires both positive and negative the later persuading him to contact a bingo playing hit man named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to put an end to her deceptive ways. It is interesting how the movie perceives the three different chronicles-even the costuming of Jewel is relative to the man telling the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful mesmerizing gift from God. Carl sees Jewel as two sexy legs and lots of cleavage. Randy is unsure what to make of her an awakening to his otherwise boring road to nowhere life. The most intriguing element of this movie is Jewel herself however deliciously played by the always delightful Liv Tyler ( Armageddon ). She is not really interested in the men but what they can offer her. Her motives are all too simple not truthfully diabolical or evil; she is simply a young lady who has learned at an early age that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty. The film has a lot of fun with its material. From the enthusiastically entertaining cast to its violently hilarious showdown One Night at McCool's takes advantage of most of its humorous ideas. What makes the movie even funnier is how the three men's points of view differ. The actors have a lot of fun with their characters too. Goodman is curiously whimsical; Reiser fits his kinky squirmy part quite well; Douglas is sly and mysterious in one of the movie's funniest performances; Dillon gives his character arrogant personality even though Randy is a lackluster nobody; Liv Tyler is dazzling. She injects Jewel with the perfect amount of boastful charisma and tantalizing wit. She reminds us of Mena Suvari's intimate performance in American Beauty. One Night at McCool's is the first film to come from Michael Douglas' new production company Furthur Films. It is a creative genuine and sexy production. Along the way we often become caught up in the twisty structure but that is a natural response to a movie that intentionally interweaves several angles to a single story. The movie ends on a note that is both black and comedic. This is another one of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way; i.e. the black comedy. Many films of this genre come across as either too black or too lackadaisical. One Night at McCool's is one of the few that actually work. ,positive
 I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I'd be able to relate to this film perfectly. Its pace as well as the dialog churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads. There are great little elements that pop up through out the film like how Rob Lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless. The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think most could enjoy. A few laugh-out-loud-even-if-you-are-alone moments ensure that I'll certainly be watching this again. ,positive
 I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director I said was in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of America It's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novel My all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb ,positive
 WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT (2005) **** (Voices: Peter Salis Ralph Fiennes Helena Bonham Carter) Fantastic Feats of Clay: Wallace & Gromit Save the Day! Crackin' Good Entertainment! Nick Park the creator of the animated team of Wallace & Gromit is a genius. His painstaking art in the form of Plasitcine claymation is a unique process involving literally thousands of hours (it takes roughly an 8 hour work day to contribute 3 minutes of action to a film; this foray into feature length storytelling took 5 years!) in making his lovable master & loyal dog team take form is finally on the big screen in the duo's first full-length motion picture and it's cracklin' good (to coin a phrase from Wallace's usual reply to all things good!) Park who co-directed with Steve Box and co-wrote with Mark Burton and Bob Baker sends up the horror genre in this rollickingly funny and swift paced action comedy with the geeky inventive Wallace (voiced by British vet thespian Salis) and his mute yet loyal (and sharper-minded) mutt Gromit (all furrowing eyebrows and mouth-less insouciance) have devised a service to their community: pest control ( Anti-Pesto as they are known) for the upcoming Giant Vegetable Festival that has the entire town in the mood for all things vegetative a gigante and the biggest pesk are troublesome rabbits eating the crunchy goods. Wallace's inventive mind has created a vacuum container that is quick efficient and more importantly harmless to the cute vermin that plague the estate of Lady Campanula Tottington (voiced by Bonham Carter making a fast-break to be the first lady of stop-motion animation what with her earlier turn in Corpse Bride a few weeks ago) who is housing the competition and is a love interest for the nerdy Wallace. The only fly-in-the-ointment is vainglorious bombastic loud-mouth and jerk Victor Quartermaine (voiced by Fiennes his first attempt in the animated arts coming across as a Patrick Stewart lunged braggard with hilarious results) a badly toupeed wearing macho moron who is plotting to marry Lady Tottington for her riches while he is a chief competitor to W&G's humane attempts by resorting to his trusty guns and nasty bulldog. To add insult to injury the duo are facing a terrible plight in the form of a huge were-rabbit (the titular monster a nice nod to both Universal and Hammer horror flicks) that is terrorizing the village and devouring every veggie in sight. The two set out to trap and dispose of the creature but there is more than meets the eye as things progress. Relentlessly funny and with such amazing elastic and kinetic energy to his wonderful clay counterparts Park and Box have created a truly magical and highly entertaining film with so much amazingly detailed production design to their little world that it may take more than one screening to absorb just how much effort in their blood sweat and tears have gone into making this instant classic for children of all ages. Wallace the cheese loving balding inventor could easily be Homer Simpson's UK cousin with his rotund body and constant knack for getting things wrong while attempting to do the right thing; his heart is in the right place but his head is in the clouds. His sweet crush for Lady Tottington (resembling a pre-plastic surgery Carol Burnett) who is a head taller than our hero will perhaps remind those of their first unrequited love with a smile of awkward admission. His Rube Goldberg-like gift for making the complicated into ease is inspired lunacy that fans will recall from the earlier shorter films The Wrong Trousers A Close Shave and A Grand Day Out . But it is in my opinion the wise silent and long-suffering Gromit his poached egg eyes of slow-burns and disbelief at what is transpiring is one of the best animated characters ever created with such an amazing arsenal of exasperated mouthless expressions and subtle nuances that most live-action actors would kill to accomplish in the attempt of conveying dismay concern grief genuine surprise and relief. His final chase  a signature of the immensely popular comic team  is ingeniously set and quickly improvised especially his literal dog-fight with the equally soundless bulldog with tenacity wit and a Chuck Jones fueled smartness that would have Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger green with envy. Wallace and Gromit match the best of Laurel & Hardy Abbott & Costello and any other classic comedy team that comes to mind; here's hoping their longevity continues on screen for just as long as their predecessors. The waiting is most eager. ,positive
 This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model I expected to be bored and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like. And who doesn't love hearing the girls bitch about each other and get into fights? Or enjoy wanting to throw something at that Janice lady? Give this a chance. Don't expect something intelligent or a show you can look to for a life lesson. Just enjoy it for what it is. Serious fun! ,positive
 I watched this episode a lot of times because I didn't get how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue Piper and Phoebe try and save their innocent A Doctor because Shax wants to kill him.

I miss Prue but I like Paige too and i'm glad the show continued ,positive
 For years i've had a distant memory of watching this film i looked on the net to find it somewhere and couldn't find it anywhere so i thought it must have disappeared. UNTIL...my gran showed me a box set she sent off for in the Daily Mail and i though nah there wont be anything decent in there but to my great surprise there amongst other gems was The Water Babies! I hadn't been that excited ina long long time! Its a great light hearted film the songs aren't memorable probably if i was a child during the time it came out i would have stuck in my mind more. Sadly it was just a film i watched at my grans 10 years ago when i was a little spud. And watching it back now the animation is terrible! and the re-recored voices they do to get a richness to the sound in films is totally off! But who cares when your a kid you never think of those things even if they lead boy is about 10 and sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty. Great classic kids film! ,positive
 Chris Penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of Jeff spicoli. This movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. Fast times was more depressing than funny. Abortions friends cheating on friends jerking off in bathrooms bad jobs and failing school. Someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life. The film even had great cameos like the maker of city limits Michelle schocked in the liquor store or Ben Stein in his first role in the sunny's surplus store. ,positive
 Patricia Arquette plays American doctor Laura Bowman who takes a holiday to Burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and young son. She is left behind in Rangoon during a military crackdown and leaves the city with an aging man who works as a tour guide. But he is no simple tour guide; he is a professor who introduces her to the life outside of the tourist traps ... the two of them get caught up in the political upheaval and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses its own people. This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. First it's informational (describing some of the injustices that are occurring in Burma). Secondly it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. Thirdly it's about compassion and sacrifice and people coming together - without even knowing each other - to endure pain and fear. Just about every beautiful scene in this movie is important; nothing is wasted here. It's an earnest and moving film. There is also a very emotional score composed by Hans Zimmer which complements scenes nicely. A definite recommend especially to people concerned with human rights ... and people who want to know What purpose can I serve?  ,positive
 In a small picturesque Sicilian village someone is brutally killing young sexually curious boys. The local police force keep busy trying to track the killer and whittle the list down to five or so main suspects including voyeuristic village retard Giuseppe (Vito Passeri) and an elusive grungy voodoo doll-poking backwoods witch named Maciara (Florinda Bolkan). There's also Don Alberto (Marc Popel) a handsome young priest who runs the local boy's school Andrea (Tomas Milian) a journalist helping to aid the police and the beautiful Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) a gorgeous but seriously screwed-up drug addict who seems to have a thing for very (I mean VERY) young boys. As typical with the giallo subgenre the plot won't be fully revealed until the last few frames but if you can hang in there long enough this film pays off. The script (written by Fulci Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) keeps red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is ably supported by excellent location work cinematography (by Sergio D'Offizi) and musical score (by Riz Ortolani). The acting particularly Bolkan is also very good. Fulci fans who were weaned on his 80s grotesqueries like THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE will find more artistry and less gore on display here than they might anticipate but they'll still enjoy a particularly nasty chain whipping scene in a cemetery (bizarrely yet effectively set to singer Ornella Vanoni's ballad Quei giorni insieme a te ) and a long tumble down a rocky embankment that Fulci liked so much that he reused it in his film THE PSYCHIC (1977). Scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen (except for a brief strangulation) but the camera doesn't hesitate to linger on their corpses. The film was not released theatrically in America and presumably because of some anti-Catholic elements in the storyline received only a limited theatrical release in Europe. ,positive
 Yes I felt like I had been gutted after first seeing it. But not until the next day did I begin to see the true brilliance of this creation. I won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film but there is one new area I want to touch on... **SPOILERS** Why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket? Most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance. I must disagree. Watch the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage. The student is quite an expressive girl (crying & vocalizing her fears)- just the opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the film after the girl is injured when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother visibly upset states We gave up everything so she could study piano and Huppert immediately snaps You mean SHE gave up everything don't you. So it was my thought that Huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. She didn't want the girl to end up like HER repressed & hardened condemned to a life of recitals...gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection. Maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago before things grew bad. Maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age. Is she ruining the student's life or simply freeing her? For me that realization made all the difference in what I experienced through this film. Brilliant. ,positive
 I never saw Doctor Who before (at least not in any focused way) so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it really also ought to say Comedy in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value) it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging which is very rare in current TV shows. I've seen the first eight episodes and #6-8 were my favorites so far. Even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up (with time-travel saving one's dead parents and that sort of stuff) works out amazingly well here. Christopher Eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light-hearted though occasionally morose Doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him I'll be quite surprised. But I'm willing to give the new guy a chance. There's little doubt however that the Eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics. The relationship between the Doctor and Rose is particularly refreshing. The Doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them which however is much more emotional and human than sexual. A good show. The biggest drawback is the low budget - a show like this ought to have better special effects. And why they don't simply use some cheaper effects I don't know. In this day and age SFX don't have to cost a bundle - just look at the Star Wars: Revelations fan film. 8 out of 10. ,positive
 Sexy murderess Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) still yearns for a life of wedded bliss with ex-boyfriend crazed killer Charles 'Chucky' Lee Ray. After getting her hands on the mutilated Good Guy doll that last played host to his spirit and doing a spot of repair work she conducts a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy. Unfortunately for poor Tiff the reanimated maniac shows no interest in marriage and so she traps him in a cage with a bride doll for company. Eventually a rather angry Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) escapes his confines electrocutes Tiffany in the bath and traps her soul in his 'bride' as retribution. Realising that they are now both in the same predicament the plastic pair put their differences aside and decide to head for Hackensack New Jersey where they can lay their hands on the magical amulet that can relocate their spirits into human hosts. Tricking trailer park hunk Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his tasty girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) into taking them to their destination the psycho dolls embark on a murderous rampage with their unwitting companions copping the blame. Although the idea of a kid's doll being possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer has always been rather comical it wasn't until the fourth film in the Child's Play series that the makers fully embraced the sheer lunacy of the premise opting to plays things much more for laughs than for scares (although there is still plenty of OTT splatter for us gore-hounds to enjoy). Talented Hong Kong director Ronny Yu oversees proceedings deftly translating the witty tongue-in-cheek script into a slick and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic ride. Similarly the excellent cast handle the camp material perfectly with Stabile and Heigl making a likable couple but smoking hot Tilly stealing the show as blonde buxom pouting PVC-mini-skirted temptress Tiffany. Kevin Yagher's impressively expressive doll effects also go a long way to making the film such a success. Overall this film is unlikely to find many fans amongst 'serious' horror aficionados but those who enjoy the odd spot of mindless popcorn entertainment full of twisted black humour crazy death scenes and magnificent cleavages should have a blast. ,positive
 Buddy Manucci(Roy Scheider solid in a chance leading role)heads a secret undercover police squad called the Seven-Ups whose tactics don't necessarily follow the exact ways of the law. They get the job done in their own way without anything being leaked to the press and this gives them a freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals most working detectives and policeman just can not nab. Buddy has a pal from childhood named Vito(Tony Lo Bianco)who swaps information with him regarding mob types and shysters working the streets in NYC. What Buddy doesn't know is that Vito is hatching a scheme using names from Buddy's check list (he has this book open taking down notes provided by Vito but doesn't know that his friend has copied those very names written within his mind)to set up mob families in a series of mob kidnappings eliciting cash thanks to two cop-posers Moon(the always-villainous Richard Lynch)and Bo(Bill Hickman)working with him. When this scheme goes awry with one of the Seven-Ups being killed Vito becomes fearful because he knows how Buddy can be when he's doggedly after someone..especially when one of his own is murdered. Extremely underrated cop flick has thrilling car chase through New York City as Buddy follows the kidnapping cop-imposter's trying to get them after killing his partner. The film isn't overly complex after the plot is set-up and we realize who is the ring-leader in the scheming of mobsters. Scheider has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor. He has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes it's toll on him. The film is briskly paced with good action sequences and sets up an interesting plot of betrayal between friends as greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what seems like a smooth crime-spree against evil mob families can get cops killed. ,positive
 Cecil B. DeMille directed a series of domestic comedy-dramas in the late teens and early 20s. He found his perfect leading lady for these provocative pieces in Gloria Swanson. In Don't Change Your Husband Swanson plays a bored housewife whose wealthy businessman husband (Elliott Dexter) pays more attention to work than to her. She is chased by a handsome roue (Lew Cody) until she relents and divorces the boring husband for the new lover. Things soon become familiar and Swanson discovers the new husband is as neglectful as the first. To make matters worse she discovers Cody has a woman on the side (Julia Faye). After several confrontations and convenient meetings things are resolved. This was a smash hit in 1919 and helped make Gloria Swanson a major star. Although she was only 20 when she filmed this she is very good as the maybe foolish wife. She looks great and wears some stunning gowns. There is one memorable scene that is 100% DeMille in which Cody is luring Swanson with promises of wealth pleasure and love. As he coos to her she imagines the scenes. Pleasure is a fantastic scene of Swanson in a spidery hammock swinging out over a pool while people dance around. Wealth is a scene in which Swanson is gowned like a Babylonian queen as servants bring her chests of jewels which shes tosses aside. Love is a scene in which she is a wood nymph making love in a forest glade with a Pan-like character (Ted Shawn). Pure hokum but very entertaining and Swanson looks great. Dexter is very good as the bland husband who shaves off his moustache and starts to work out in order to win his wife back. Cody is also good as the fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. Faye is funny as the bitchy other woman--named Toodles no less--who gets hers. Sylvia Ashton plays Mrs. Huckney. Ted Shawn was married to Ruth St. Denis and together they were groundbreaking and influential modern dancers (of the Denishawn School). Swanson impresses me more every time I see her. She seems to have been such a natural actress and yet there is a way that the camera captures her expressive face that is just mesmerizing. She's a joy to watch. Very entertaining film with lots of color tints in varying scenes to keep things lively. And a lot of the furnishings are back in style 86 years later. ,positive
 -love is hard to find in this fast food society that we live in so man called Hitch makes it duty to help men find love with women that they are beyond madly in love with. his rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex which seems like a great deal but soon word begins to spread around and people begin to get the wrong idea about what he does which begins to complicate the relationship with woman he just met that he is madly in love with. -I have to say it's really nice to see Will Smith in a movie that doesn't have him trying to save the world from aliens or robots. There are no jaw dropping effects nor is he showing off his beefed up body. He's just a normal human being in this movie which was really nice. He doesn't necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this movie but then again the story doesn't call for that but all the same it was nice to see him relaxed and not showing off his ripped body to make those of us without six packs jealous. His character here is as with all his characters likable witty and very charming which is something that almost all the characters in this odd love tale seem to share. The Kevin James character is just a regular guy that needs help hooking up with the girl of his dreams which really makes you feel for the guy and root for him every step of the way. the only character that was a sore spot for me was the Mendez character because she's so cold and calculated that it's hard to believe that Smith could fall for her. He must love a challenge I guess. -now this is the part of the review in which I'll make a joke about how I would never need Hitch because I'm such a player but I just got through writing about 16 reviews for another web site plus I'm still working on a little project so I'm a little jaded right now. whiles the movie is packed with enough charm and likable characters with funny lines it slowly but surely falls into the sea of formulaic romantic movies in which after the big scene where the terrible secret comes out everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. But hey there's like 4000 movies about the underdog overcoming adversity so I guess one more movie having a predictable ending that's been done to almost death doesn't cause much harm. I really like the message of the movie as well because in the end you don't need a formula to get the right girl just be yourself and all will fall into play which is theme of the movie and why it works so well. I'm sure if it had turned out that the James character gets the girl after following everything that the Smith character said then it would have being a pretty empty movie but as it stands it works really well. -despite being predictable this is a PERFECT date movie. It's sweet it's funny and it's romantic so anyone that watches this movie on a date should be getting some after it's over. and by some I mean sex ,positive
 I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid. I loved it. Whilst I haven't watched it recently I am sure I would enjoy it just the same today. Its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh. The situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother's ashes (who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion) the robbers and the nuns. This nice humour style is much missed these days. Also this movie proved that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty/Days of our Lives) was off to a great start. I recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video shop. ,positive
 I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades. As an American the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. If you are not a fan then they are Satan's team!! Well at least that's how it was as I grew up in Washington DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys. So I am pretty sure when this film was shown up North that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction--their national sport AND the closest thing they have to a national team in the NHL. Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for the Canadians AND Maurice the Rocket Richard. However when his mother accidentally buys him a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and forces him to wear it I knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy. This ability to connect to the character--even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film. The way the other kids treated him and his conversation with God at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film. Very clever and memorable. ,positive
 [CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles' bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor we see what made disco die: Jon killed it. Jon next tried to pick up girls at the video store. He ended up feeling down in the mouth. Literally. The laundromat was no prize either when Jon and his would-be date get a glimpse of each other's underwear. Jon tried to act all buff at the beach but soon he angered a real buff guy which left Jon feeling once again down in the mouth. Literally. Jon then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by. No avail. Jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat a fat man walked up and stomped Jon's guitar. It was hopeless. Fortunately for Jon an ad flashed on the TV: an ad for Lorenzo's School for the Personality Impaired. It guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. Jon and Garfield attend the class. The building didn't exactly look the same way it did on TV nor did Lorenzo act as peppy as he did on TV. Jon sat next to a pretty girl named Mona. So while Lorenzo taught his lessons of introducing yourself checking your pulse and pretending to speak a foreign language Jon and Mona get to know one another. They leave together forgetting all about Garfield. At home Jon and Mona just sat on the porch and talked. Garfield was jealous of Mona for fear that she would take Jon away from him. Garfield envisioned the future: Jon and Mona get married she moves in and soon she gives birth to a little Arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling Garfield's tale. Back to the present Garfield would not stand for it. He tried to get Jon to get rid of Mona until she started scratching behind his ears. But then Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So that was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other every now and then and Garfield was sure to be with them. Another hilarious Garfield TV special! This one was made during the run of TV's Garfield and Friends. Garfield was slimmed down somewhat. SOMEwhat. Since hie early 1980's cartoons. The scenes of Jon trying to pick up chicks is funny so is the one where the fat guy stomps on Jon's guitar. Good ol' Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (The third man of 1 000 voices) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (The woman of 1 000 voices) is Mona. If you like Garfield then I recommend you see Garfield Gets A Life today! It along with Here Comes Garfield and Garfield on the Town were just released on DVD! So check them all out today! You are guaranteed a good time. Hey has Garfield ever let you down before? - ,positive
 Many people are making fun out of Steven Seagals acting abilities. And I really see why if I remember Fire Down Below. Well...ok his other films are acceptable (regarding to his acting!). After reading reviews about The Patriot I didn't expect anything from this film. I barely came through Fire Down Below and I read a lot that The Patriot was even worse. So I was really surprised about this one. In my opinion it is one of his very best movies. If it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be THE best. I liked the story the directing and the actors. Cammilla Belle was just incredible. She will have a great movie-career in the future. The few action scenes were very well made. And Steven Seagal was very believable in his unusual role. ,positive
 I am surprised people after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 7.0's I thought more people would get a kick out of Throw Momma from the Train . This was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession. Billy is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead Danny has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him. When Billy gives some misunderstood advice to Danny Danny offers a proposition to Billy if he kills his ex wife Billy has to kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh. Please sit back and enjoy this movie people! It's a good one! 7/10 ,positive
 Like a very expensive Buffy episode peppered with plenty of humor. Lots of wire and stunt kung fu. The Twins Effect goes on the list of classic must see HK films. The vampires have a cool blend of hopping ghost type and the pretty boy European style. If you get the opportunity to see this one in the theatre it is worth a 30 minute drive otherwise buy the import DVD before someone screws it up by giving it a bad dub. ,positive
 Watching this on Comcast On-Demand. Every time I see this musical I am amazed at the songs...one show-stopper after another. This interpretation is for me magical. The songs sparkle...the vocals orchestrations and choreography are amazing for a made-for-TV movie...better than many stage versions I have seen. The debate over Bette just doesn't make sense. She is Mamma. Her voice is brilliant and yet full of the pathos of the stage mother living through her daughters. I still get tears at the end when she finally has her moment of glory no matter how faded that glory is. The Tulsa/Louise duet/dance is on now. Fabulous. Stephen Sondheim is the King of musical theatre. His lyrics just roll off the tongue like silk...Styne's music is perhaps the best ever penned for the stage/screen. Thank God we have this masterpiece of the American Musical Theatre captured on DVD. ,positive
 This film is an excellent teaching tool as a pre-study of To Kill a Mockingbird. In conjunction with a study of the novel itself ...Caged Bird... can be used as an independent literary study or as an introduction to TKM. ,positive
 I can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. In my case I at the time this film was released was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. For me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. While some of the pranks that takes place in this movie like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road strung up in the trees or out on a lake are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not. When I went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin. As I grew older I realized these night raids to the girls cabin that I participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun. That's what MEATBALLS (MB) is. MB captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree. MB give a great example of pre-teens teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high & high school and college. The opening title song that goes Are you ready for the summer?...no more homework no more books no more teachers dirty looks... describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids. I personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink. What boy nerd or jock didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper? What guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? While these two characters are somewhat over the top I bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from THREE'S COMPANY. I would bet that most viewers even cheer for Spaz in the egg carrying competition and for Fink as he attempts to beat the stomach in the hot dog eating contest. Lastly this movie had normal looking kids and counselors. No super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing. It is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie. ,positive
 there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films especially nowadays where the trend is sex action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie. i truly truly loved this movie technically and character development wise; the plot was complex and that's what made it terrific. ,positive
 i LOVED THIS MOVIEE well i loved the romance part with COlby and the girl...Rachel (?) 4got her name....i honestly was only interested in those too. i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that. but please no more sad endings where they cant be 2gether! =( it made me cry! but the romance between them. the plot the trauma everything was great. =) i just was more into Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) everything about this movie was thrilling the kind to keep you glued to your seat. because i sure was. Honestly my only personal want would be more focused between the couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent ending. I hated the ending a better one could have been more thought out not the fact of forcing COlby to his death and Rachel having a son. The ending would have killed the movie. ,positive
 If you like who-dun-its you will like this film considered the best Italian detective story (giallo) Fulci has done. It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone. Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking but she was naked nonetheless and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest. Young boys are turning up missing and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you? Don't jump on the first guy it's way too early and he is too obvious. Anyone familiar with Fulci will be able to guess the killer who died a violent death at the end. What crazy reasoning he had. ,positive
 An exquisite film. They just don't make them like this any more! We eavesdrop on an upper middle class family in Dublin in the early part of the 20th century. They are hosting an after Christmas dinner for their friends and relatives. Their table talk is just idle chatter but it is so well written that one is engrossed. Away from the dinner table some fine piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere as if one were there as one of the guests. Perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player the odd mistake here and there would have added to the magic of this film. No real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for up and coming film makers. ,positive
 I watch a lot of movies - DVD features and classics you name it. The night I watched JERICHO MILE my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school that it had stayed with her all of these years. Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter & son) and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles. We all were. She who remembered the original and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe it. Our favorite scene? Bar none when peter Strauss so passionately bangs his fist down and says i'd do it AGAIN! . It didn't advocate violence because it was a defense crime but evoked such intensity we couldn't believe it...when his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts there wasn't a dry eye in our house. Someone please make more movies like this one. UNBELIEVABLE!! ,positive
 David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life this time the creatures under the sea in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea! The cinematography is astounding bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it as well as seeing each episode is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures or those impressive shots of the whales they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it! 2001 had some great tv shows to our screen. But in contrast to this documentary gem they make them pretty lame! But to even boast this documentary series as the best tv series of 2001 just does not sum up the sheer brilliance that this series provides in quality entertainment! Overall this is the best TV series of 2001 with no competition and maybe the best TV series of 2000s! ,positive
 I would rate this film high on my list of Ingrid Bergman films. Ingrid's beauty aside her talent is evident in scene after scene. She was sad mean witty snobbish flirtatious delightfully funny loving tender sorrowful distressed happy etc. You name it she was all those things and more. -And so convincing. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who comes back to New Orleans and falls for a Texas gambler Gary Cooper (Clint). I especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the dining table saying nothing just staring at each other.

 This is the third Three Stooges short that the team ever made and like a lot of their early ones this is absolutely and totally hysterical! Now owning it on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1 whenever I feel like it I watch this! In this short film Moe Larry and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone but boy they end up making a mess out of everything! This short is another one of my all time favorite Three Stooges shorts I also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy and the Three Stooges are the kings of slapstick! When I heard that it got nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Film I really became curious about this when I heard that it had lost I was very disappointed about it! This short is one of the Three Stooges funniest by far I extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot! 10/10 ,positive
 Like classic Hollywood musicals the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan. Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets. Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions. ,positive
 Yes 2:37 is in some ways a rip off from Gus van Sants Elephant. It's about some students who are dealing with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them. Yes it's full of clichés but that's life. You just can't deny that creepy nerds disabled persons or popular students who despite their popularity do have problems are existing in the real world. But that's not what this film is all about. It's not about life in Highschool. It's not about the misery of life itself. If you look beneath the surface beneath the soap-like social relationships that are shown you will find some gripping thought-provoking criticism of our society. Why are people committing suicide? Do we really understand their motives? Or are we just trying to understand after its already too late? And why is it always someone you would never have expected it to be? This movie doesn't answer this question but it raises it. And it does so in a very intense way. All the way it keeps you guessing whose blood it might be that you see at the very beginning. You are following the paths of some students all of them having a more or less good reason to end their lives just to be forced to watch the gruesome act in the finale. Did you know who it would be? Or were you caught by surprise like in real life? The message is verbalized by one of the surviving kids in the end. We are always so fixed on our own problems we forget to see those of others. There might be someone a colleague a friend who does not want to live anymore. But if you don't open your eyes you'll never know until its too late. This movie delivers well. It might have some flaws but they don't matter anymore when its over. Either you see a reflection of society or you are blind for reality. ,positive
 An extremely powerful film that certainly isn't appreciated enough. It's impossible to describe the experience of watching it. The recent UK television adaptation was shameful - too ordinary and bland. This original manages to imprint itself in your memory. ,positive
 Has there ever been an Angel of Death like MIMSY FARMER in Barbet Schroeder's 1960s heroin opus? Sort of Jean Seberg with a hypodermic. Pink Floyd score. Despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses a classic shamelessly ripped off by Erich Segal/Noel Black for their inept JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971) although Tippy Walker playing a similar character is herself very junkie-appealing in the latter mess. MORE though is terrific a great 60s drug movie and simply an important document of its time. Very much a cult film so join the cult. No American movie then as far as I can remember charts the same territory. MIMSY's an astonishing archetype elevating this into mythic realms. Not for the faint-hearted. Great sex scenes too. ,positive
 Oliver Stone hits the bull's eye with this film aided chiefly by Bogosian's electrifying screen presence and biting brilliant screenplay. Every moment crackles with a steadily-growing tension climaxing in a truly memorable movie-going experience. If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it! The result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame. An ultimate indictment of our society's increasing morbidity and self-sickening hunger for the next big thrill. A film not easily forgotten. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature. ,positive
 Three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another. The one-hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over. I have seen other segments of the Dekalog but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure. The film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder. Obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen (at least in the short 1-hr version of Dekalog 5). We are made to imagine that this must have been the case. A cab driver who is a misanthrope has two facets to his character: the good side feeds a mangy dog cleans his cab meticulously picks up dirty rags thrown by people who lack civic sense and remembers his wife while dying; the bad side frightens small poodles refuses to give a ride to a drunk--probably worried that he will puke in the cab--and ogles at pretty girls. The repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic and pushes strangers into urinals without any provocation is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh. Kieslowski's film and the script thus present the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters. Yet the film is not about capital punishment but more a treatise on killing. The Fifth Commandment Thou shalt not kill is explored theologically--( Even God spared Cain...') sociologically the tenderness of brutes to children and poor forlorn dogs and psychologically (after effects of drunken night with a male friend that led to the accidental death of his sister whose photograph he carries with him). What makes ordinary persons turn into killers--this is never fully explained but suggestions are legion. In Kieslowski's world there is a pattern where events and people are interlinked in a cosmic sense (note the resemblance of clown to the killer as it hangs from the mirror in the cab). Kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to ask us to look at the Commandment literally and figuratively--why do we kill? Are the people legally killed truly bad? Is there a force beyond society (the drunken night that led to life of a girl) that makes us into abhorrent murderers? It would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two detailed killings in the film--both without mercy. The film invites the viewer to contemplate why we are asked by God not to kill. I understand a longer full-length version of the film was made by Kieslowski. But even this short 1-hr version is superb with its bleak and sparse script intelligent editing interesting cinematography and top-notch direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts. This segment anticipates the more wholesome Dekalogs 6 7 and 8. ,positive
 Out of the many films I've seen Tommy Boy is a rare film where I can watch it over and over and it's still funny. David Spade and the late Chris Farley do their best in this film and is a must-see by anyone who's a fan of the Spade-Farley duo. ,positive
 with two old friends. I've always enjoyed both Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films and of course their team efforts are always worth watching and often hilarious. Although I didn't personally regard this film as in the hilarious category it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots. Brent Spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical Cruise Director. Gloria DeHaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive. ,positive
 This movie has to be seen for the music which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Obviously the original soundtrack is not exactly hi-fi but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections. The cantata can be appreciated for itself but having seen the movie helps. The story itself is fairly standard Soviet wartime anti-German propaganda. An amusing anecdote is that Stalin was later so eager to buy time by appeasing Hitler at the onset of World War II that Eisenstein was seconded to a German movie for a short while as penance. Prince Alexander Nevsky (revered as a saint by the Russian Orthodox) having earned his nickname by defeating Swedish raiders on the river Neva musters Russian resistance against an invasion by the Teutonic knights and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other would-be invaders. An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians being taken as slaves by Mongolian soldiers and does nothing to stop this as the Teutonic knights are his priority. The historical Alexander Nevsky paid tribute to the Mongol khans as his father before him while working to consolidate his realm's future independence. ,positive
 It ends with the declaration that the film you have just seen was an improvisation -at once making you feel like an idiot for thinking an improvisation was an good movie and astounded at Cassavetes' genius...once again. Of course Cassavetes told some guy it wasn't really an improvisation per se on his deathbed so...it's the story about a light-skinned black woman Lelia who passes for white and her family: another passing-for-white brother named Ben and a black-black brother named Hughie. When she falls in love with a white jerk named Tony he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out she's black and from there it goes on about the three main characters' individual aspirations and shortcomings. Hughie is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure Lelia's still hopelessly depressed over Tony and Ben is angsty and violent in general in desperate need of something to shock him out of his stale patterns of existence. Overall I suppose it's really about stasis vs. change in human life. I suspect that Cassavetes had the plot organized enough and it was just the dialogue that was improvised. The dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes somebody will say something very memorable other times it's memorably awkward. What's amazing is the extent of the amateur actors' embodiment of their characters. Cassavetes went through the acting class he was teaching at the time he decided to do Shadows whispered in the ears of the ten best students and this was the result...the guys playing Ben and Hughie are very good. At first I didn't like Lelia but as the film progressed you see more and more she's one of those actors who gets better as the tension and drama builds - not necessarily the best with small talk. Shadows is hailed by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement (made in 1959) and it's definitely recommended. ,positive
 Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers he needs to take some time off as everybody around him relies to much on him and stages his own death. When he discovers those he loved ans still loves are in need he gets Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina) to help them. In search of his own past of his own desires this fabulous film by Claude Lelouch is a man's quest for himself at a ripe age. Built like all Lelouch films the film's beginning with constant flashbacks may be puzzling especially scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks a huge lot like his father) is playing a young Sam Lion while Sam Lion stands in the same room - a flashback sequence which takes a second to grasp. One of Lelouch's most elaborate works L'itineraire d'un infant gate is a must-see tale of self fulfilment. ,positive
 Cleopatra (the delicious Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Cesar (Alain Chabat): in order to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans she promises to build a fancy castle for Cesar in a period of three months without any delay. She calls the one-arm architect Numerobis (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered by gold if he accomplishes his mission or become crocodile food if he fails. Numerobis will ask for help to Panoramix (Claude Rich) Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very funny specially the parts where Obelix and the Pirates leaded by Red Beard participate. However the screenwriter and the director should have noted that French is not an universal language as English is. Therefore the jokes with words (like in Austin Powers movies for example) does not work well for people strange to French language. French people and persons fluent in French language will certainly like these jokes but they do not make any sense for me that do not speak French. My vote is seven. ,positive
 Chokher Bali was shown at the (Washington) DC Filmfest April 15 2005. The director Rituparno Ghosh was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards. As always I think Aishwarya did a fantastic job. I can understand those who think she should be been more aggressive or more bitchy but would that really be realistic in 1904? Possible maybe; realistic I'm not so sure. I think her interpretation was valid although there could certainly be other ways to do it. I hate to use the word but this was the most inaccessible of the Indian movies I have seen so far. I know a fair amount of Indian history Hindu religion etc. but the level of detail here was far beyond me. Clearly you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were intimately familiar with Hinduism and its customs esp. as they were c. 1904. I missed a lot of things--one of them being the fact that the mother-in-law would want Binodini in the house as sort of a counter-weight to her daughter-in-law Ashalata. *spoilers* Ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie much better for me. First the original Bengali version was 20+ minutes longer. So what was left out? Apparently three main things: a beginning segment where Binodini (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal for Calcutta. According to the director different characters are speaking W. Bengali vs. E. Bengali--setting up some of the political comments later. Of course all of this is lost in the Hindi version and certainly to a non-Indian like me it wouldn't have mattered anyway--but a set-up of the Bengali situation sure would have. Next there was a segment where Binodini was writing a poem--a sign of her independence etc. Finally some more business about the jewellery. So although some people think it was too long I think the original longer version would have been clearer. The women's hair was apparently another sign (Ghosh again)--the mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows) her sister--also a widow--had longer hair (more modern!) and of course Binodini/Aishwarya had extremely long waist-length hair (rejection of status of widowhood). The ending really threw me--all of a sudden Binodini who had never had a political thought is writing a political manifesto? Whoa! Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno at a film festival when the subtitles were done. The subtitles use the word country throughout Binodini's letter. Gosh said a more appropriate word would have been (I forget his exact word) something like self or independence --she was talking about her own liberation and finding herself --not about Bengal India and the British. So why does Binodini just disappear the day after finding Behari again? Apparently because during her stay on the Ganges she realizes that she doesn't need a man--any man--to define/complete her. She can just be herself. So she rejects Behari who she threw herself at a few months (?) before and just goes off. Of course I'm not sure how she buys her next meal but that's another question. The red shawl (Ghosh again)she buys represents revolution as well as passion. I'm not 100% sure why she puts the shawl on the dying woman but perhaps she is rejecting passion/revolution? The binoculars which Binodini uses throughout the movie (to watch Mahendra and Ashalata the boat on the Ganges etc.). She is being a voyeur to see a life she yearns for but can't have. At the end (I missed this!) she leaves the binoculars on the table with the letter showing that she doesn't need them any more--she's going off to lead her own life. Finally the Tagore quote at the beginning saying how he apologized for the ending... Apparently Tagore wrote this as a serial hooking his readers with the sexy widow bits. But at the end he sold out to conservatism and had Binodini kneel down at the feet of Mahendra and Behari begging their forgiveness. One of his students (?) wrote to Tagore taking him to task for his sell-out ending...and Tagore replied with his apology for the ending. In the movie of course Ghosh goes in the other direction. ,positive
 Dear Readers 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best...although I really can't say that as Space Odyssey is his only film I've ever watched. But still it's a good film. Strange but good. The movie is in three acts much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. Anyhow we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also Sparach Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of Man' sequence. Then there's the odd 'Finding of the Monolith' sequence on the Moon played to Strauss's Blue Danube. Finally things get good with the Spaceship scenes and HAL going berserk and killing people. After that things die down and we have the 'Entering the Monolith' sequence which was WAY too long and the ultra-strange ending. Even though 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good film. It's not Star Wars Stargate Terminator or The Abyss but it rocks. My compliments to the chef Mr. Kubrick. Signed The Constant DVD Collector ,positive
 If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while until you get the details then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak... I don't want to write more to not spoil the movie for you but trust me if you like SF-authors like Lem or Capec or even some from Orson Scott Card you will love this movie. ,positive
 I wish Hollywood would make more movies like The China Syndrome. Because this one scores on every level. It has an intelligent believable script. It shows you that it's not only nuclear power itself but the money involved in it that causes danger. And the movie also gives you a great behind-the-scenes look of how television is made. It scores as a thriller: the first time I saw it it kept me right on the edge of my seat. And it scores as a character-movie: I really cared for the main characters. Jane Fonda Michael Douglas Wilford Brimley and most of all Jack Lemmon are great. ,positive
 Though not a huge fan I am a Three Stooges purist. I believe that their best work by far was with Curly as the third Stooge and their earliest films are generally their best. That's because after a while they began remaking their films and the gags started to get stale. Here in 1934 they were still rather fresh (in more ways than one) and funny. Here they boys play very improbably roles--respected doctors in a hospital! The three run amok acting silly hitting each other and scaring the pants off anyone who expects to get better. The non-stop energy and freshness make this one a must-see for fans. By the way although I liked this film I STRONGLY recommend you try to find a much lesser known short from tiny Educational Pictures. NIFTY NURSES is much like MEN IN BLACK but manages to be funnier and is about the best hospital comedy of the era--better even than Laurel & Hardy's COUNTY HOSPITAL. ,positive
 No one said that in The Big Trail and I thought it would be a natural. Nevertheless this was one of the best Westerns I have seen and I am a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies. The scope and feel of this picture is simply staggering and as someone mentioned in their comment it does have the feel of the 3-camera triptych of Napoleon (1927). Nowadays the cost of the production and especially the cast of thousands would be prohibitive but Raoul Walsh got it done. The cast was excellent although John Wayne was better when he had no lines and just swaggered around. In particular Tyrone Power Sr. was a perfect villain - I had never seen him before and this was his only talking picture. Ian Keith was a snake but El Brendel is an acquired taste as the comic relief. He can be funny or annoying but mostly the latter - and he shows up at the most inappropriate times. It is a bit too long and it took a while for the Indians to show up but this is as close to a documentary on Manifest Destiny and as true to life as you will see and a must for movie fans regardless of genre preference. By the time the settlers got to California I was exhausted. ,positive
 It's a horror story alright. But perhaps not as you know it. The real monsters in this flick are humans. While the monsters are human and prey. As weird as that may sound I see this as Monsters Inc for horror film fans. Sure the effects are of a std horror film the monsters are there as in any monster based film the gore is there as well there even is a slasher in the shape of Dr Decker (played by David Cronenberg; I see flash of Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Batman Begins here - or is it the other way round?). And it is Decker &c who are the bad guys. The monsters want mainly to mind their own business warding off intrusive humans more or less misguided wanting to join there society. By the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters (and the dog) - not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes.... ,positive
 Goldie Hawn in 1969 was best known for playing in television comedy shows - in particular ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN where she was the giggly cookie young blond. She did make movies before CACTUS FLOWER the most notable being a Walt Disney feature THE ONE AND ONLY GENUINE ORIGINAL FAMILY BAND. But CACTUS FLOWER picked up on her character from LAUGH-IN and (due to a good script by I.A.L. Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on an Abe Burrows play) she was able to develop the television character so that a real performance was fleshed out. As a result Ms Hawn won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969 and her career took off to such future hits as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although other stars of LAUGH-IN did well on television (Henry Gibson has a recurring role as a judge on BOSTON LEGAL) only Goldie was able to have a career as a bonifide movie star. On LAUGH-IN Goldie's personality would show a naiveté that would be embarrassing. Occasionally she realized it and would laugh loud to cover but sometimes she just did not see her error (example: Goldie is introduced to the 1950s variety show host Gary Moore and is told Goldie this is Mr. Gary Moore. She shakes his hand and says (much to his confusion) I've always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore! ). But as Toni Simmons it is quite different. She is desperately in love with Dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau) a successful dentist who can never marry her. Julian has told her that his wife (with whom he has had two sons and a daughter) will never give him a divorce. So at the start of the film Toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her stove. But she is rescued by her neighbor Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz) a struggling dramatist who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas. Toni is resigned to live but she has sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note but Julian's receptionist/nurse/assistant Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) won't stop Julian's work schedule to pass him the phone when Igor calls. Instead Julian finds the letter and races to Toni's apartment only to find her alive. When Igor supports her story that she tried to kill herself Julian realizes the depth of her love and decides he must marry such a woman. Unfortunately Toni has swallowed Julian's lies and believes in his wife and children. You see Julian has no wife and children. Since Toni is a firm believer that she can't marry a man who would lie to her Julian is stuck on a weakening tree branch. Julian comes to solve it by getting Stephanie to pretend she is Mrs. Winston. Stephanie is opposed to it at first but on her own on her first free Saturday she confronts Toni at the record shop Toni is at. They talk and Toni notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of Stephanie (and since Stephanie has her two nephews with her Toni thinks they are Julian's kids). Toni tells Julian they have to see who is the man that Stephanie is supposedly going to marry. So the lie starts spiraling for Julian Stephanie and Toni. Soon a lover is given to Stephanie in the form of Julian's friend and freeloading patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so sleazy (Stephanie loathes him) that Toni feels that he is unworthy of Stephanie. And so it goes with one complication (most caused by the well-intentioned misinformed Toni) following another until the conclusion. The script is full of first rate situations and one-liners (example: Julian to reward Stephanie for lying about their marriage buys two record albums from Toni's store. He has given a mink stole to Toni but she decides to send it to Stephanie with Julian's card. Stephanie is quite happy at getting the mink but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she got - when she profusely thanks Matthau he says the thought she'd like Horowitz - meaning Vladomir Horowitz. But Stephanie thinks Horowitz is the name of the furrier!). Bergman must have enjoyed the filming as several scenes shows that earthy radiance that was a trademark for her in the later 1940s films. But there was also the resemblance to her 1958 film comedy smash hit INDISCREET. There Cary Grant lied to make sure the pair would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage. When Grant's lie is revealed to Bergman she decides on a lie of her own to convince Grant that she was making him a cuckold. Here instead of being the passive lover believing Matthau is telling the truth Bergman gingerly tries to get Matthau out of his mess by little white lies only to find one leads to another to complicate everyone's lives. Bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem despite trying to be part of the solution. All the leads perform well in particular Bergman all business thoroughness at first but gradually reclaiming her sexuality. Matthau is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an impediment that just can't be kicked aside. The supporting cast especially Weston as the mooching and sexually slimy Harvey and Vito Scotti as the U.N. ambassador who actually has the hots for Bergman. It was a clever comedy and a really good way for Goldie Hawn's movie career to push forward. ,positive
 Once again I must play something of the contrarian. Most of the reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive. Mine is positive but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a C letter grade from me. It seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors: One that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood film and two that it is trying to do things differently. The first point I couldn't care less about. I'm not looking for realism in films and so I do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how I believe the real world to be--I'm a big fan of surrealism fantasy absurdism and so on although I do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist. For the second point I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However I don't think originality versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself. A film can be original and poor just like a film can be formulaic and excellent. What matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer. Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai cop named Daya Naik. Naik was an encounter specialist . Encounter specialists who could be said to be early instantiations of real world Judge Dredds are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue and they're basically given a license to kill--effectively acting as policeman judge jury and executioner in a matter of moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar) the encounter specialist based on Naik. We see him at work interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence. We see him at home trying to live a normal life in his less-than-luxurious surroundings. We see him trying to adjust to a new commissioner halfway through the film. And we see his odd relationship with a notorious Indian gangster Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). All of this has the potential to make a fabulous gritty film. I agree that it's nice to forgo the typical Bollywood musical numbers and romances--not every film needs that stuff; Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced. Additionally Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances--Patekar almost gives off a Death Wish (1974)-era Charles Bronson vibe. It also has admirable cinematography--the hand-held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective for example. It has a great score that mixes more of a moody Hollywood-sounding action/crime score with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. The violence is well done and gritty. There is also decent exploration of subtexts including the morality of (having) encounter specialists the idea of following orders and so on. The encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong. More poignantly the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. Parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and say members of a country's military and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to. But (you just knew there was a But coming didn't you?) director Shimit Amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters far too much sprawl and that moves a bit too slow. All of these problems may be due to Amin and crew looking at the Godfather films which Ab Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) resemblances to although from a policeman's perspective. Most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well--these are shallowly drawn characters to say the least except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). For one Narayan I didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film. His name is mentioned a number of times but I'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change. Then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and I'd have to start all over figuring out who Narayan was. The same thing happened with Agashe's first commissioner. The film was already far into the new commissioner before I could figure out the relationships. It seems like there are new characters in every scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. While that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about (because they're mostly doing so on orders) since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists either it's difficult to find characters to care about and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film. The primary villain is Zameer. But until about halfway through the film there's no indication of this. He doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film and he's literally phoning his performance in --he's in another location (Dubai) communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film. We don't actually see Zameer doing much. To an extent the film depends on a couple twists that necessitate not showing Zameer doing a number of things but we could see him do other things and a lot of the other villains could have been left out. That would have tightened up the film a bit making it more focused and about a half-hour shorter both of which would have benefited its impact. This is not an action-packed film by any means. For at least the first 45 minutes or so I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style but saying Okay get on with the story already . ,positive
 Four lovely young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives: sweet Susan (winsome brunette Elaine Giftos) tries to comfort the bitter terminally ill Greg (a moving performance by Darrell Larson) eager but neurotic Phred (lovely blonde Karen Carlson) romances handsome gynecologist Jim Caspar (affable Lawrence Casey) free-spirited hippie Priscilla (the stunningly gorgeous Barbara Leigh) gets impregnated by laid-back drug dealer Les (the solid Richard Rust) and compassionate Lynn (nicely played by Brioni Farrell) helps out angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (the excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this film was made for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures it's anything but your standard mindless piece of leering soft-core schlock. Instead it's a very pleasant charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy early 70's (the subplot involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is especially potent and provocative). Special kudos are in order for director Stephanie Rothman who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material. Moreover the four attractive and appealing female leads all turn in sound and praiseworthy work. Scottie MacGregor likewise impresses as wise supervisor Ms. Boswell and ubiquitous 70's trailer voice guy Ronald Gans supplies the off-screen voice of a psychiatrist. Stevan Larner's polished cinematography the fantastic rock soundtrack and the flavorsome folksy'n'funky score by Clancy B. Grass III are all up to speed. A real sleeper. ,positive
 This film was very interesting to me virtually a film within a film which is about a very whimsical director who cleverly persuades an actress and and actor (who happen to dislike each other) in producing sexual chemistry on film. The director is faced with a fusillade of obstacles as she tries to get the two individuals to perform beautifully on film. Sex is Comedy is much more than a comedy packed with uncomfortable quirky moments the movie also addresses the psychological and innate instinctual behavior of men and women in regards to the sometimes controversial act of sex. I loved this film the character Jeanne played by the beautiful Anne Parillaud performs wonderfully on screen as you share in her struggle to produce a motion picture work of art. ,positive
 Certainly the highlight of this film is it's cast. Diana Rigg George C. Scott Bernard Hughes to mention a few. I have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years than I care to think about. This comedy attacks the pomp and pretension in all aspects of our society through the setting of one of it's Most Haughty institutions... the Medical profession. The idea that such goings on could be possible might be a shock to some but is a delight to anyone with the perspective of experience. Dr Brock (Scott) undergoes a mid-life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes as we and he become enamored with the prospect of his involvement with Miss Drummond (Rigg). The thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mix in the form of the irony that the Hospital appears to be killing it's own workers as they mismanage their affairs in it. The climax is unpredictable (unless you've seen it) and made even more hilarious if you happen to guess. It's not everyone's brand of humor to be sure and has uproariously funny Dark Moments if you're open to them. I loved every minute and was delighted to see it out on DVD. ,positive
 I can't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? It really is great very funny. I would strongly recommend this movie for all of you adults teenagers and especially children! The story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie at home and school. One day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. But he didn't so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours or he would have to go to Summer School. Yep he wrote it in 2:45. Big fat liar I think it was a story of himself. On the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous Hollywood producer and he gave him a ride. But the kid forgot the story in the limo. He told his parents and the teacher but of course they did not believe him. And the movie producer he took the kid's story as his new movie Big fat liar . When the kid saw the trailer of the movie he told his parents he had written it but they didn't believe. So he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: The truth is never overrated Enjoy this great movie you won't be disappointed. Don't trust the 5.2/10 rate it should be 9/10! Believe me! P/S: so sorry my English isn't good enough to make a better comment! ,positive
 THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a superb example of an anti-80s film. While many other films of the decade in general lacked substance this film is pure substance. There's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it. It boasts two superb performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee respectively. Hutton Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things (all 3 starred in TAPS). While Penn and Cruise's popularity soared Hutton has been largely forgotten about and that's a shame. Actually Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980 but I think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding. Hutton really captures the post-Vietnam war rebelliousness in his character Chris Boyce. A failed seminary school student Chris has a love-hate relationship with his father well played by the great character actor Pat Hingle. The scene where Chris quotes the poem his father thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one. Chris gets job at Dept. of Defense and uses his hatred of U.S. gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviets. He gets his buddy Daulton a hyper drug-dealing self-server in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm. While Chris is doing it based on his beliefs Daulton is doing it strictly for the money. The Soviet liaison is excellently played by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of funny set of exchanges between them. But make no mistake this film is anything but that. It is a serious character study about pessimism malaise paranoia and mistrust. Again the leads make this film. Hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Chris a rather smart young man who had so much potential. Penn as usual does a tremendous characterization as Daulton a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks and most of the time doesn't think at all. The ending of this fact-based film is very saddening on several levels. A truly powerful character study. ,positive
 The music is by Stravinsky (and not by stupid incompetent Philip Glass) and was written ten years before glass' unfortunate birth. The staging is simply extraordinary. The narrative in Japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the Latin version does not have. cf. Terzieff's version. The giant heads and hands are totally justified by the mythic aspect of the tale. The props and make up used for the plague are simply spot on. It's Taymor's best work. The singers are very good especially Terfel. Langridge is quite moving and clean and Norman finds the right expression and her beauty is magnified here and finds its right place: larger than life. Simply a must. ,positive
 This was/is an incredible movie with incredible cast music singing story etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (the Gerswhins or Premingers) can keep it from being available to generation after generation. I have wanted to see it again all of my life. I just found this site and read why it has not been available. Shame on these families for their pettiness. My wife is from Germany and she has never seen the movie. Neither have my step-children or my grandchildren. It is very sad that a movie of this depth and quality is not available for them to see. Where do these families get off making such a conceited self-important egotistical condescending decision to prohibit generations from enjoying this film these stars these performances this music! Release the video and let them world judge and enjoy! ,positive
 An unjustly neglected classic Intruder in the Dust is one of the great films of the 1940's which has unfortunately slipped into obscurity. Based on a story by William Faulker and shot in his hometown of Oxford Mississippi Intruder tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hernandez) a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man and a white boy (Claude Jarman Jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to Beauchamp. Terrific acting especially by two great character actors Porter Hall (as the dead man's father) and Elizabeth Patterson (best known as Mrs. Trumbull on I Love Lucy ) as an old woman willing to stand against the townspeople to see that right is done. This straightforward tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more. ,positive
 Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It's a good movie looking at after war psychical problem from the other point of view. Emilio Estevez is great as a young man haunted by the demons of Vietnam war causing problem in family. Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. It all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past with whom Emilion Estevez's character can't seem to deal and Martin Sheen's character don't want do deal with. Protective mother looks at this problem with warm and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons. ,positive
 Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock film Sabotage made in 1936 which has a completely different plot) is not the Master of Suspense greatest film. It dose not have the depth of Vertigo (1958) nor the brooding atmosphere of Rebbeca (1940) and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in Notorious (1946) but what it dose have is thrills adventure and a nail biting climax. The two leads admittedly are quite weak. It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the Robert Cummings role and Barbara Stanwyck for the role that was taken by Priscilla Lane. Also the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (that were written by Dorothy Parker) have dated badly and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). However the last half hour is edge-of-your-seat viewing the climax atop the Stature of Liberty is very well done and the film is a clear predecessor of North By Northwest (1959). The two villains Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the Aircraft Factory is a superb sequence. This not the best film Hitch made but it is surly one of his most entertaining. ,positive
 Engaging entry from Europe about Czech fighter pilots flying for the RAF during WW2. It's always interesting as an American to see a new point of view on familiar events in history. There's nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which this is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative. Still it is compelling all the way through. There is a good balance between drama romance humor action and symbolism that is understated beautifully by the director and cast. This is a breath of fresh air after sitting through overblown and boring Hollywood epics like Pearl Harbor. A solid production all around. This is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema. ,positive
 Due to the fact that in 1976 there were no CGI I felt that the movie was quite watchable. The studio productions were very good and very elaborate. The background effects were very believable and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set. The actors did OK considering the premise of the film being set in a type of Jules Vern atmosphere where imagination and possibilities of future exploration were at most improbabilities. Had I watched this film in 1976 I probably would have been in awe of the ability of man to build a machine that could travel to the earths core. I still wonder to this day why we are not all flying around in our cars but I digress. McClure and Cushing have their funny moments mostly from their facial expressions toward each other which of course makes the film somewhat campy which I loved. The 'monsters' left something to be desired but the story had a good premise although I feel as though some other sort of 'thing' could have been more believable under those circumstances. All in all quite watchable for its time and fun now. ,positive
 Noel Coward is perfectly cast as a suave vain selfish well educated upper class publisher. The literary crowd that congregates at his office is equally lacking in depth and seems concerned only with their status and success. They constantly meet at Noel Coward's publishing office in the hope of gaining favor for their next book and to make sure they are not left out on the latest gossip in the artistic realm. Cora is a young idealist and poet who believes her love can change Noel Coward and that they can establish a long lasting relationship. She ends her relationship with her fiancé to become Noel's lover. However Noel returns to his playboy ways after 6 months and ends the relationship. This breaks Cora's heart and she eventually returns to her fiancé who has since lost his job and self respect after losing Cora. The story picks up when Noel Coward leaves New York City by plane chasing after a new lover a concert pianist who is just as shallow as he is. However a storm is encountered and the plane crashes into the sea killing Noel. God takes pity on him and grants him one month on Earth to find someone who will cry for him otherwise he is condemned to wander the Earth never to find rest for all eternity. The climax takes place on a dim rainy night and ends with a prayer and a miracle. A strange redemption occurs. The death experience teaches Noel the true values of life although his former associate artists are incapable of understanding his message. The film has beautiful music and the scenes are classic film noir. Unfortunately it is not on DVD or VHS. For those who enjoy this type of movie it is a classic masterpiece. Noel Coward's dialog is sharp and witty and no one could play the part better. ,positive
 Thank God for the Internet Movie Database!!! When I first got this movie I watched it every night just before before bed and was getting something different out of it every time. But no matter how I sliced it it came up disturbing. The black and white and all the twitching really freaked me. You stare at the screen unsure of what you are looking at and just when you think you got it it becomes clear and it's something completely different. The imagery is VERY disturbing twitching and straight razors do not sit well with me in any movie. Still everytime I watched it I was interpreting it somewhat differently (there is no dialogue ya know) so I decided to check the IMdB for the plot summary. Boy that throws me for a loop I had no idea that was supposed to be God. Now I'm going to watch it with this in mind and see what happens.... ,positive
 Highly recommended to all those who appreciate watching movies. Great acting perfectly surreal awkward humor requisite prison sh-t accurate depiction of the male condition. Music is also spot-on. I think the artist is Dip but not sure. The short loop of the title credit song on the DVD menu is well-timed and sounds like Slint.

 Malcolm McDowell diagnoses Megan Gallagher's daughter and she as having a form of illness when they believe they are seeing The Huldre troll-like creatures which live with the rocks and the roots (to quote the movie). Basically a family moves into an older house which has a smaller doll-house in the backyard. The daughter (well played by Sofia Vassiliova) starts to befriend the creatures until they become vindictive. The family cat also disappears. There are a few good scenes with Megan Gallagher ( Millennium ) and Malcolm McDowell as the psychiatrist. There is also something strange which occurred to one of McDowell's patients. If you enjoy this type of story you may also like Bad Ronald which had a similar odd theme and the house is haunted by bad Ronald (Scott Jacoby) only that movie is from the 70's. 7/10. ,positive
 I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested. With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series. Plots are intelligent scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future. While most producers and directors in Hollywood ignorantly view Sci-Fi as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations. This series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the shoot-em-up video game monster mentally of much of the current generation. It has brains history a message and good entertainment. It is an adult series without unbearable teenage know-it-all fantasies. Hurray! Now if we can only get MGM to release the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD instead of just the six poor teaser discs and the 1st season now only available. ,positive
 The main point of the movie IMO is the fact the Joanna's whole life has been nothing but a series of facades. The movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box. What is strange is that she is hiding this from her HUSBAND. If she has to hide mundane things from her loved one one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her life. When Joanna accidentally hits Cory she leaves the scene to call the police. By the time she returns the police and ambulance are there as well as people from her community remarking What kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there? Well-respected in her community she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done. But she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her facades... Great movie-I have seen it many times! ,positive
 Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with soapish material Ted Danson did his best with a thankless role of Chip Davis The premise of this that the two ladies' friendship one a seemingly happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her biological clock ticking. I found the relationship that Ted Danson's character had with the single woman played by Christine Lahti's rather sordid. He behaved in a caddish way yet he left two widows pining over him bawling. I found it revolting when when Sandy told him she wanted to break it off after meeting his wife he calls her saying he misses her (did he call his wife? There was no sign of that). He behaved like a heel. It perhaps would have made a more interesting film had he not been killed off. Perhaps both ladies would have wised up and dumped him. I liked the friendship between the two ladies but it was spoiled by what they had in common: The Cad of a husband. ,positive
 If you've ever seen Open Water this is the same kind of gritty edgy indie style of film. i liked the action suspense. the slow building of it all i just hope they don't do to this one what they did to Open Water with that sequel.. but anyways the one thing i didn't like was the annoying younger sister i was rooting for the croc the whole time.. film starts out pretty much like it should kids packing up for a trip they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 mins. before they got there so i guess his assistant takes the two sisters and the boyfriend out on the water now mind you this is the second day of their adventure curiously enough the first day they spent at guess hmm a crocodile farm.. so they are out there and all is good for a little while then bang crocodile time... very intense you know something in this movie you don't see the crocodile a whole heck of a lot but when you do gosh it is very scary i love the croc's snout and eyes and the shroud of fog that seems to enshroud the croc every time he raises his head above the water very very creepy but good overall this is a great film if you can get past the annoying little sister. ,positive
 Background info - The movies Octopussy & Never Say Never Again were both made the same year 1983 and so naturally people compare them. Moore vs. Connery. Bond vs. Bond. I've heard many people claiming that the official movie Octopussy is far superior. Well I just watched Octopussy. Bond is riding an airplane at 100 miles an hour (impossible---the wind would blow him off) using his feet to force the plane to ground and then jumping off at some 60 miles an hour (again impossible---try jumping out of your car---you'd end up with a shattered body). How is that octopussy scene supposed to be good in any sense of the word? Suddenly Bond has super-human strength & a titanium body. And he does all these stunts at the ancient age of 56??? Complete crap. Unbelievable. Farse. ---> Now let's contrast the above scene with Connery's unofficial Never Say Never Again: It doesn't have the same polish due to its independent film status (less money) but at least you can believe that Connery is a real spy in real danger. The movie starts off with Bond showing his age (he is 50 after all) and being sent off for recuperation. Entirely believable. But of course there's no such thing as a day off for a world-famous spy and Bond quickly finds himself a target even inside the hospital. From that point the story spins off into another adventure with Bond trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weapons. As usual Sean Connery did a brilliant job and avoids the over-the-top/unbelievable stunts. This movie feels like a natural successor to Connery's last film 1971's Diamonds Are Forever... the old style of Bond... before the franchise got silly. Highyly recommended. ,positive
 An interesting look at the immigrant experience told as a fable with some very weird imagery. I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships I cannot imagine it was very comfortable as shown in this film. Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities. In the film we see physical and mental exams the latter because of the view that low intelligence is heritable. Single women could not enter the country on the presumption that they would become prostitutes so most married single men already in the country as arranged beforehand at Ellis Island before entry. This is the story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who arranges to marry a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He is trying to get his family through with a son that is mute and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi) that is considered feeble-minded. She was fantastic in the role by the way. You will also see character actor Vincent Schiavelli in his next to the last appearance. I don't know if his last film has been released. He plays a matchmaker and is also very good. It was a strange but enjoyable film. It's not for everyone as I imagine those who don't have some interest in the immigrant experience would find it rather slow. ,positive
 I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8 1994 each of the characters are in their mid 20's and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting music film writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes. Highlights include: a visit to Jimi Hendirx's grave Kurt Cobain's original childhood home and a campfire sing along. An honest an original piece of work. ,positive
 Spike Feresten is a comic genius. 'Talkshow' demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that have made shows like Letterman and The Daily Show successful. His likability is palpable. He seems to find the unique angle of the joke not the predictable sitcom path...thank God. His comedy is reminiscent of the award winning Arrested Development (cross your fingers that 'Talkshow' has a longer life span). The topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by unnoticed by everyone else yet when he creates a joke around them out you wonder how you missed it the first time around. I particularly enjoyed the sketches... Unfair Target will be a cult classic in no time. Set your Tivo's people...this is a show not to be missed. ,positive
 First at all: If you like watching movies I recommend you NOT to watch this one. Why? Afterwards you won't appreciate any other movie so easily anymore... Actually I don't wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect intense and beautiful this work of Einar Gudmundsson is. When in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography  in Angels of the Universe there is nothing of this ambivalence. Really everything is just great even (and not least) the soundtrack with the magnificent Sigur Rós. In this story about Pall a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend especially the dialogs (and monologues) deserve some attention: together with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd. What is more they are often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors. One of the other comments was already referring to another point: This movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening. Despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing partly cynical and bitter and most of all sad. It is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness rage and solitude. Finally: When you've seen the movie  watch it again. There are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the moral of the story . And of course: read the book it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better. ,positive
 I've loved this movie for a LONG time. I hadn't seen it in a while so I again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now. I loved the Chipmunks cartoon when I was young so naturally I adored 'The Chipmunk Adventure.' I honestly can't think of a better plot to this movie. It's not wildly creative but I've always wanted to travel all over the world and so I just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more. The part with Elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry... 'The Chipmunk Adventure' will remain a favorite of mine forever I'm sure. I guess it's because I saw it when I was so young. I don't think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time. (Unless of course they have a young heart) ,positive
 This is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos. It is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing embedded in the marvellous array of characters a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score and witty light direction from Montgomery himself. This is one to watch over and over. Montgomery is a bit part actor who finds himself assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutante's home to discover the identity of her former beau a suspected jewel thief. While the premise is rather preposterous the results are hilarious. Montgomery is the befuddled plant Ann Blyth is a marvel as the romantically obsessed terribly earnest debutante and the parade of comic characterizations from veteran stage actress Jane Cowl's lawyer mother to Lillian Randolph's take-charge maid - are all fabulous. Oddly enough this only earned an Oscar nom for Sound when it deserved top nods for Direction Screenplay and Musical Score. DO NOT MISS IT - it's one of Hollywood's best. ,positive
 THE GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) is for this viewer the finest film of the year to date. It is a masterpiece of concept writing directing acting and cinematography. More importantly this radiantly beautiful film is a much needed reflective mirror for us to view the history of immigration of 'foreigners' into America at a time when the very mention of the word 'borders' is a political fuse. Writer/director Emanuele Crialese has given us not only a deeply moving story he has also provided a touchstone for viewers to re-visit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of the Native Americans we all entered America as 'foreigners' at some point in our histories and it is humbling to view this film with that fact in mind. The film opens in turn of the century Sicily as poverty stricken widower Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climb a rocky hill to present their tokens to the cross to ask for a sign as to whether they should continue to struggle for existence on the island or go to America the land of dreams. Mancuso's deaf mute son Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) runs to the top of the hill with postcards he has found with images of America (money growing on trees fruits and vegetables larger than people etc) and Salvatore accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to America. After convincing his reluctant mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and his sisters Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to make the trip he sells his only possessions (two donkeys goats and rabbits) and the man with the boat arranges their trip giving the family shoes appropriate clothing and instructions to board an ocean liner as third class passengers. As the Mancuso family prepares to board they are asked for a photograph and as they pose behind a painted set an Englishwoman Lucy/Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) walks into the photo as though she were part of this peasant family. Lucy cannot board the boat for America without male escort. The voyage begins and Luce in her gentle way identifies with the Mancuso family finally solidifying her safe passage by proposing to Salvatore to marry her 'for convenience not for love' when they arrive in America. Through a violent storm and living conditions that are appalling poor the multitude of third class passengers survive bond and eventually arrive at Ellis Island believing their dream of America has been fulfilled. But everyone must pass harsh physical tests de-lousing and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter America: the officials let them know that America does not want genetically inferior people entering the new world! Each woman must be selected by a man to marry on Ellis Island before they are allowed admission. The manner in which the Mancuso family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the closing of the tale. Few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment immigrants face (or at least faced at the turn of the century) on Ellis Island and if we do we have elected to submerge that information. THE GOLDEN DOOR presents the case for immigrants' struggles in a manner that not only touches our hearts but also challenges our acceptance of current immigration legislation. But all political issues aside THE GOLDEN DOOR is first and foremost a film of enormous beauty exquisite photography deeply felt performances by a huge cast and a very sensitively written and directed story. The is a film that deserves wide distribution a movie that is a must see for everyone. Highly recommended. Grady Harp ,positive
 and I for one think that is a good thing. I've just never been a Rosalind Russell fan although the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this. As for the rest of the production I think it was slightly less than the original movie. One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails-on-the-blackboard voice belting out HEY! It takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah! and although I missed it I was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy. I also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre not just at the movies. I think the other thing I liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song Let me entertain you which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it. ,positive
 It came before the ten commandments land of the Pharaohs Ben Hur and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books the secret of the kingdom (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land). The Egyptian is the rising of a monotheism close to Christianism long before Christ:the Pharaoh(Wilding) is some kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world:he asks to return good for evil!And he has disciples who will eventually turn into martyrs (the scene when Simmons and the other worshippers of the Sun God are slain is visually stunning looking like some pagan ballet).For the priests on the other hand this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the populace and that's why they look for a strong man (Mature)who can lead the army against the Hittites as well as against their dangerous compatriots.Another religion or non-religion should we say is Sinouhé's (Purdom)who during two hours believes in nothing (the sequence of the grain of sands is absolutely sensational and rises the whole movie well above the average peplum !!) There's another fascinating side:the movie looks like a flamboyant melodrama.Not only for the screenplay (notably pharoah's sister's (Tierney)final revelation which predates the ten commandments by two years) but also the splendor of the cinematography:Viviani in his book about Curtiz talks about a Baudelairian atmosphere blue and gold notably in the scenes which involve the prostitute (Darvi)who contemplates her reflection in the water of her bath supreme narcissism. Around the hero all the characters appear disappear appear again but when they reappear they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with consummate skill.Besides as such is often the case in modern melodramas the story is a long flashback framed by two short sequences showing Sinouhé an old man who's remembering. This is a wonderful sword and sandals that had a strong influence not only in America but also in Europa notably in Poland where Jerzy Kawalerowicz directed a spellbinding faraon (1966) which owed a lot to Curtiz. ,positive
 This was the most thought-provoking capital-punishment movie ever! It refused to seem one-sided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get. This movie had one of the most 'human' (And I use this term in a good way) compassionate religious character ever! This movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book (Which is rare for me). Sister Helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religious(Which is also rare). And it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out. And we have the director to thank for that. This is not a film for entertainment. But it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart. I can't think of another film like it. ,positive
 And I do. Peter Falk has created a role that will live on forever in TV land! And I'm grateful for that. This isn't one of his finest hours though. Columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they're smarter than he is. What all us fans know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent. Without a great enemy how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat? Still it's better than NO Columbo and I'll wait and watch the next one as well. ,positive
 I saw this movie yesterday and can't stop thinking about it. I moved to Norway four months ago and have tried ever since to find the origin of the strange emptiness i felt. When I saw this film I was striken with the brilliant snapshot of this society. Yes this is all true!!! I too found a great job with a great pay and I live with my norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment downtown. But so far everyone I have met have left me with that tasteless empty feeling I had never had before - this is what this movie is about. Dinner parties with nothing to say to each other but emotionless comments long silences no stress a creepy calm and frozen smiles of niceness. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly rendered in Den Brysomme mannen. See this movie!!! ,positive
 In the world of shorts (most of which aren't) this film is a gem. A quiet concise peek into the world of a young woman who's a reader for a blind woman here the stellar Elizabeth Franz - this film bears the textures layers and visual storytelling of a sumptuously painted still life. The dialogue is minimal the cinematography is stunning and the direction sure clear and compelling. I saw this film in a film festival held in a loud and crowded Tribeca bar - and within the first two minutes (and for the first time that night) the crowd fell quiet. That says it all. ,positive
 excellent drama. very dark. i have never seen california photographed in such a way. bridget fonda as the deaf wife beaten by her husband is superb. the film gripped me from start to finish. very understated performance by sutherland. the direction was very european. amazing to get such a performance from fonda. ,positive
 One of the best 'guy' movies I've ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion. Gad the scenes... Raisouli's bandits swarm over the wall... A staid British gentleman calmly gets up from tea with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat. A whisper from the ghost of Empire... Lest we forget! Lest we forget! U.S. Marines coming ashore from the long long gone _Brooklyn_. They were carrying Krags it should have been Lees but oh wow. And the Winchester 97 blowing large holes in obstreperous natives and even more obstreperous and faithless Europeans... Raisouli --Sean Connery o Wow!--wondering 'What kind of gun does Roosevelt use? Teddy Roosevelt--Brian Keith o Wow!--wondering What kind of gun does Raisouli use?' and writing yet another angry letter to Winchester about the stock on his Winchester 95. Raisouli armed with but a sword... A Prussian cavalry officer HOLSTERING his pistol and drawing HIS sword... Honor. That's something long dead from a world long gone but Raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children into a building... Milious at Milious's magnificent best and now out on DVD. ,positive
 This movie was awesome. It's a documentary about how surfing influenced skateboarding in the early days. It has interviews with skaters such as Tony Hawk(my idol)=) and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is a so called ghetto part of California where there used to be an amusement park that was torn down. People started riding alongside the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon the Zepher Surf team was formed. That led to Skateboardings first real start in Dogtown. The Z boys were a team of ragtag teenagers who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon known as vert skating. They started it by skating in drained swimming pools. That's just a bit of the story behind it. It even contains rare footage from Charlie's Angels of Stacy Peralta making a cameo. I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. It'll teach you that skateboarding wasn't always popular. Even if you are not BUY! ,positive
 This parody is cleverly done: from the songs (Express Yourself becomes Expose Yourself Like a Prayer is now Party in my Pants and Vogue is now Vague) to the fake interviews of the cast of the show this movie is hilarious. Remember Madonna saying she didn't know about the rain season in Asia? In this one she doesn't know about the volcano season. It is a precious jewel. They got a lot of money on that spoof and it pays off. Highly recommended!!! ,positive
 Though I saw this movie about 4 years ago long before I started commenting on IMDb I decided to review it now which is unusual for me since before now I often reviewed something just after seeing it. What can I say? Well the best performance is that of the late Peter Boyle as the title character who after finding out about a man's killing the drug-dealing boyfriend of his daughter wants to bond with him even though he's a Madison Avenue executive who has nothing in common with the very lower-class conservative Joe. In fact there are plenty of funny scenes of Joe at this guy's party making smart alecky remarks there. Oh and it should be noted that the actress that plays the daughter who they're looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after overdosing on some drugs is none other than Susan Sarandon making her film debut! This was a pretty hard-hitting movie for the time it was made (late '60s-early '70s) and was compelling work from scripter Norman Wexler (later of Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen (later to do Save the Tiger Rocky and The Karate Kid). Certainly the ending packs a wallop even today after all these years! Highly recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of that time. P.S. Among the cultural artifacts seen here are a Raggedy Ann doll a box of Ritz crackers a bottle of Heinz ketchup and unique for the era a Nixon poster asking Would you buy a used car from this man?  ,positive
 The slasher sub-genre has been pretty much exhausted - in fact even by 1979 just one year after the supposed 'first slasher' Halloween (which was released seven years after Bay of Blood) was released; the sub-genre wasn't far from being exhausted; but Tourist Trap represents one of the more original outings. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers - i.e. madman murders a load of kids but draws its originality from the fact that madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an unseen assailant or a man in a mask) and we actually get some insight into his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities including being able to control the wax dummies that fill his house adds to the originality. We kick off with a great opening sequence which sees a young man fall foul of having a flat tire after finding himself in a gas station of terror. The scene is amazingly creepy as the wax dummies taunt him and things fly from the shelves - and it gives the audience a great insight into what is to come; namely a very creepy horror film! The acting credibility is as non-existent as you would expect from a seventies slasher but to be honest; it's not all that bad. The girls look hot the boys don't really matter; and Chuck Connors is more than adequately creepy in the role of the psycho. He's not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still good enough. It's not the acting that's the star of the show however and as you might expect - the creepy atmosphere takes that prize. Wax models as proved by the likes of House of Wax (Vincent Price version...) are very creepy; and the film makes best use of that fact. There are very few things in cinema that can be frightening by simply being there - but wax statues are definitely one of those things. The killer's special ability could easy have gotten in the way of the atmosphere but the film makes best use of this fact even by having various things fly off shelves and it goes well with the rest of the movie. On the whole this is a very good film. While Tourist Trap might not be absolutely essential viewing; it's well worth seeing and I can recommend it. ,positive
 I´ve been able to see this great movie at the Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I went out of the cinema I felt like being drugged down *g*! I´ve really seen lots of movies and there are just a few I´d call perfect like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Subconscious Cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people watching it in Berlin went out of the room and I can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone living in his/her perfect world day by day dreaming his/her dreams not thinking bout the horror on our planet-in our life! I don´t think I have to describe the story of the film for you because of the people having already written on this page! It´s a movie that shows everything and more!!! Gets 10 points + from 10!!! It´d be cool if you people who have also seen it loving it would write me an e-mail!So far I haven´t met anyone as impressed and pleased by it as I am!!! Finally sorry for my bad english-I´m not a studied person (und das ist auch gut so!!! :-)))))) ,positive
 Footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize. Psychological thriller is the most appropriate description I can think of. The female protagonist Alice Cespi discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days. The only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. She is also haunted by a recurring very vivid dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago. In her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't trust anyone but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before. This is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold and particularly how it will end. The unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well. The important part of the one and only Nicoletta Elmi everyone's all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of Italian horror is an extra bonus. ,positive
 Writers and directors by the nature of their craft stand back a frame from the action in their work to show insights about characters and situations. Here Huston and Joyce have stepped back a bigger frame yet to show us the ultimate view of what it means to be human. Until it's very end the movie appears to be about nothing much the kind of typical circumstances that fill every day life. It is not until the end of the very final scene that we realize that it is in fact about everything. It is not possible to watch this final scene without simultaneously feeling pity and also deep affection for oneself and the rest of fellow beings. ,positive
 Batman Returns is more Gothic and somber than its predecessor and I like it a lot. Also the scenery is more darker and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul-chilling music composed by the so-talented Danny Elfman. However I didn't like the idea to make the Penguin a monster unlike to the comic books where he's human. Even if he looks like a monster he shows well that he possesses a human dignity and I felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents. But still he was a dangerous villain in fact and he needed to be stopped. Michael Keaton made a tour de force with his return as the Dark Knight and this time he's powerful as in the original Batman. It's not difficult to understand why he's called Batman in public sometimes... Also Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well-fitted in her role and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain/crimefighter dressed as a cat. Really the actors did all a masterful work with Batman Returns which made it a successful movie. If you liked Batman watch its awesome sequel cause it's very worthy for all the Dark Knight's hard-core lovers. Steve Baillargeon ,positive
 Excellent episode showed Dean has not only good taste by picking Cassie for his girlfriend but also shows he does have a heart and can love just one woman and he's not just some guy who loves and leaves em! Aweso e episode. Applaud them on this one. I only hope that some way they go back to the Cassie relationship next season (if there is a next season??) i would like to see her come back into their supernatural lives especially Dean's. Also I like the fact the chose an African-American woman to be the special lady in his life that got away somehow. I hope they don't screw that up and end it as he episdoe ended. The girl who played Cassie was truly a looker and it was good to see the WB branching out into what we all see in everyday life-the interacial coupling that has become common and acceptable(finally!) ,positive
 Surface was awesome I don't know how many Mondays I survived at school just by thinking about the new episode of surface. I loved it sometimes I had to call home and tell my mom to tape it for me. I was pretty upset when I heard it was cancelled I mean jeez way to let us hang. So they can have their new Tina fay comedy(you couldn't pay me to watch that I think seeing the commercials made me dumber). I'm gonna miss my Monday night fix of Surface even if my sister did make fun of me. although kidnapped does look good and they still have L&O: SVU (i think i still have to check) (i only wrote the 2 lines above because they said i needed ten lines). ,positive
 eXistenZ is simply David Cronenberg's best movie. All the people compare it to the Matrix. They're not even similar. If you enjoyed Cronenberg's other works just a little bit you'll love this one... ,positive
 I had the privilege of attending a regional premiere for this this is one of the funniest British movies ever the plot is fantastic focusing around a young girl who unwittingly changes into her ideal man at a computer fair whilst also creating a copy of herself who falls in love with him the film is full of jokes both visual and aural and has a bright and fresh feel to it and the acting is of great quality released in U.K. on July 2nd this film is a must go see it!!! ,positive
 This movie has an outstanding acting by Marilia Pêra and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco. This is in my opinion the best Brazilian movie ever made. The movie was filmed with child from the 'favelas' the brazilian ghetos. The children weren't actors and were casted by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison that looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately this is not purely fiction in Brazil it does happen till today. A must see for those who like violent movies. But take your mother off the room because it is a hard movie. ,positive
 Before I forget let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated critics would be lauding the direction in here because it's really good. To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him too and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat. Anyway Sylvester runs over opens the porthole and says Hello breakfast! Tweety slams the porthole window on his face and says You bad old peeping tomcat! The cat falls into the water. The undaunted Sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship tiptoes into Tweety's cabin grabs him and is ready to leave when - wham! - there's Granny at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. But flippety gibbet says Granny I've dropped my glasses. I can't see a thing without 'em. Heavens to Betsey where are those cheaters. Now Sylvester has the upper hand....and the normal cat-trying-to-catch-bird shenanigans are on again like Granny's glasses. Sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them so when she woke up and put them on she'd see the bird and think it was okay. Overall a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. As you can tell by the quotes I love the dialog in some of these old cartoons. ,positive
 I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams back in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90's) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k complete with bearded host. Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced dead-pan filibuster Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show) boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios. This is distilled 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made. Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now. save it for later). Frank Drebin is clueless at most times a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable. He is a master of the police investigative methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy). This does not make him a bad cop. Cops get lucky also. Capt Drebin (notice he's a Captain here) has perfected it. Along with his partner Nordberg and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes. The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote-ables. Most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly. The magic never came from the sight gags however. At its core was a nonsensical and straight-faced conversation and activities in the foreground with crazy things occurring in the background. The movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series. Think of Monty Python's And Now For Something Completely Different..... If you liked Airplane 1 & 2 Naked Gun 1 2 3 or Top Secret then you will definitely enjoy this. I always liked the series better than the movies even though I saw the movies first. Why? 2 words : No O.J. ,positive
 I tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch. I was immediately sucked in by the characters. Robin Tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. Her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% believable. Really this sort of thing is not easy to do. She pulls it off fantastically. We know early on this film is going to end tragically but you cannot take your eyes off of it. The characters do stupid things but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters. This is just a great example of film making IMHO. Great writing great acting great directing. A film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment. ,positive
 This delightful well written film is based on a New York stage play bearing the same title where Sir Aubrey (knighted Sir Charles Aubrey Smith in 1944) originated the role he plays in the film. Here in 1931 we see him in the early part of his acting renaissance in the very early era of talkies and in the character role that he would make his own until his death in 1948 after finishing his last performance in Little Women which released in 1949. This engaging play is about an elderly British aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and introduces himself to them having brought them to his manor in England. Marion Davies plays his daughter-by-error and it's a tour de force for her. She is all at once endearing impatient shallow enchanting wise and compassionate while creating an indelible and beguiling character that remains well ensconced in the memory. The 26 year old Ray Milland appears here in a small but prominent role having already appeared in seven other pictures then only in films for a bit more than two years. The film should be enjoyed as a representative of 1931 Hollywood factory production of course and as such is not flawless. However it's a charming pleasure from first scene to the last. ,positive
 OK. So it can be done! We have here the perfect vampire movie. Gothic beautiful. With all the ingredients. A realistic vampire. A wonderful story. Take note - I am from Transylvania and I assure you this movie respects the vampire lore! It's exactly like the tales I heard in my childhood. For a transylvanian it is quite... believable. You must see it if you are interested by real vampires as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent Hollywood movies (as far as I can guess the Hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus - which is pretty hilarious for me. Vampires are never good-looking or attractive they can inspire only horror and repulsion. The incubus - called in my country The Night Flier is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them.) I strongly recommend this for any Gothic person out there! See also the sequels they are all 4 very good! And of course don't miss DArk shadows! Something similar is Nosferatu In Venice with Klaus Kinski. I recommend that one to. ,positive
 This is the second and best in the Hunting Trilogy! What makes it the best is the clever dialogue! Bugs: Do you want to shoot me now or wait till you get home? It was kind of funny how they kept that going through out the short! ,positive
 Again I've read all of the comments posted here and agree with the many intelligent ones but totally disagree with those who think it was/is hokum. Personally I think nuclear is about the only energy left to us unless our governments (feds and states) increase the grants thinking homeowners will use photo-cells on their roofs. Many attractive and pricey homes in Southern Calfifornia are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around the sun. I live in a loft which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof the entire day. I hardly use the AC - I'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler. We are blessed with dry heat in this part of the country. I'm from the Gulf Coast of the USA so I know about humidity....... That said I found the China Syndrome to be a convincing movie about what COULD go wrong if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear plants. I think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear it like the plague: they ARE safe. TMI is still on-line.... Director James Bridges carefully guides this plot (by Mike Gray-T S Cook) to build suspense and to a thoughtfully interesting film. All the roles were well-played: Jane Fonda ( Kimberly Wells ) Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell ) and producer Michael Douglas ( Richard Adams ) are all excellent in their roles plus all of the rest of the cast. I too loved there being no score. It was so interesting to get a true-to-life glimpse of the behind-the-scenes of the TV industry - that shouldn't be surprising. Currently Dan Rather is sue-ing CBS and I hope he wins. Can you believe Donald Trump saying he's a loser ? Trump - who cares? tiberius1234 posted a very good comment here - I agree. It is my opinion that getting vaporized by a nuclear spill is much better than living in a world which has been wasted and becomes Blade Runner and/or Solyent Green . Come away from your video-games for a couple of hours and watch this dated movie (really isn't) and get a little education on nuclear energy. I Recommend it to the whole family.... ,positive
 Like a lot of stars of the big screen as their careers wound down so many turned to television where probably they secured their reputations for posterity. Donna Reed is a case in point. I don't think Donna Reed ever thought that Donna Stone was anything challenging not to a woman who had won an Oscar for playing a very different type in From Here to Eternity. She was certainly better prepared to play wife mother and homemaker Donna Stone after having played Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. Donna was always beautiful and wise and ever helpful with the problems of her kids and her husband. Carl Betz was not an idiot he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house. Talk about the man being ever ready in a crisis. Though this was the Donna Reed Show because Donna's husband at the time Tony Owen produced it. Yet it lasted as long as did because of the popularity of the two children Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had that best selling teen record Johnny Angel which she introduced on the show. She successfully made the transition to adult star most known for her role in Coach as Craig T. Nelson's wife. But Petersen was a bubblegum teen idol back in the day. The Donna Reed Show dare I say got most of its viewers because of him. It's forgotten now but Petersen also had a best selling record My Dad. Didn't do half as well as Johnny Angel. Now Paul Petersen runs a support group for former child stars like himself. So many of them end so tragically it's good work that he's doing. The Stone family was the quintessence of Middle America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago they led wholesome lives. Mom and Dad were always there for the kids. Of course the problems they had usually were nothing more than breaking curfew. It's this series I believe was the model for the TV town of Pleasantville where Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are sucked into. I have pleasant memories of The Donna Reed Show. Easy to take but not too seriously. ,positive
 Shes the man is great. its funny original and made me laugh so much i nearly wet my seat. the day i went to go see it at the movies i wasn't in the best of moods (man trouble)but leaving the movie i had a grin plastered on my face. The story is a bit out there with the whole no-one noticing that she looks way too much like a girl but hey who am i to say whats believable the jokes are great and some of the one liners in this 2006 hit could go down in history. Amanda B. did a great job as the main role and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous Duke. So girls go see this because its a great laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys u go see it because you might just learn something about girls! All in all a brilliant fantastic and fun movie which i will be buying on DVD when it comes out. ,positive
 I haven't been a fan of Madonna for quite sometime now however I thought I would comment on this film. This film mistaken. One of them as well as Madonna was panned by the critics. They were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews. First Madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first. She plays a ditsy blonde in the film she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life. Most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didn't give her a fair shake. When you view this film I hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting. She was absolutely hysterical as was the film. Griffen Dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film. If you take a look at his filmography you will see he is quite an accomplished actor. As far as the movie itself this is something similar to pretty woman but came 3 years before the Roberts Gere success. It's a goof-ball comedy with lots of site gags slapstick and one liners. Some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor. I know this doesn't tell you much about the movie however I hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie. It is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun. Peace.

 Without a doubt one of Tobe Hoppor's best! Epic storytellng great special effects and The Spacegirl (vamp me baby!). ,positive
 It's particularly hard for a director to capture film-making without getting precious inbred over-dramatic or all three. Breillat ably demonstrates the instinctive lizard-brain methods of a female auteur in extracting from two cattle (as Hitchcock called actors) a love-scene of searing intimacy. Her main battle is with her leading man ( an actor is really a woman she opines) although naturally it is the leading lady who will steal the show. I disagree that this is Breillat's first comedy. 'Romance' was at various points hilarious but I accept that the French sense of humour can be elusive for foreigners; indeed dozens of IMDb reviewers detected no comedy in Romance. By contrast Sex Is Comedy raises plenty of laughs mainly by using an actor's prop that goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks. We wondered leaving the theatre whether Roxane's beard was a wig. A lovely performance from Anne Parillaud as Breillat wrestling with her own script looking ten years younger than her age. ,positive
 This movie as my Chinese girlfriend informed me features two well-known Hong Kong pop stars. While this may make the movie a mere marketing stunt I found the acting acceptable and they're both cute. The story is pretty poor overall. The vampiric traits and weaknesses are however used in humorous ways and created some uniquely entertaining bits. The quarreling between the two girls made me chuckle and this gave a fine balance together with the well-executed action scenes to create an entertaining movie. ,positive
 Based on actual events of 1905 silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an Imperial Russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by conditions on the ship citizens of the port city Odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of Imperial forces who attack the civilian supporters with savage force. POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. Amazingly each of these sequences manage to top the previous one and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history. Filming largely where the real events actually occurred director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film. To describe POTEMKIN as a great film is something of an understatement. It is an absolute essential an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form purely visual cinema at its most brilliant often imitated seldom equaled never bested.

 Kind of a guilty indulgence nowadays this used to be required watching when i was in high school. It really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in LA in 1980. As the bands play Spheeris prints the lyrics in subtitles which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the guy is screaming into the microphone. But also it turns the camera's POV into that of tourist passing through this alien world. The band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn't exist anymore. Then again it's not as easy to come by $16/month former-church closets like Chavez of Black Flag does. How many unheard of bands do you know that aren't trying like the dickens to get a record deal? These guys just didn't care. And who can't love the commentary of the little French dude who used to be the singer for Catholic Discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His gritty voice delivers one of the best soliloquies ever captured on film: I have excellent news for the world ... there's no such thing as New Wave. Whew! What a relief! ,positive
 First a word of caution. The DVD box describes this film as a comedy. I don't think that was the intention of anyone connected with the film other than some marketing morons. While light and a little bit funny in places it is NOT a comedy and if you expect that you will be disappointed. I had never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations one way or the other. Considering that the other two DVDs I picked up were big disappointments I was so happy when I saw this film. The acting writing and direction were excellent. The story itself definitely interested me as you don't usually see films about the final month of France before the Nazi takeover in 1940. It gave some insight into the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to partitioning their beloved country. Along the way there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress played very well by Isabelle Adjani--who looks marvelous after all these years. She kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall. This sap escapes from prison and finds her--with another lover--a high government official and weasel played by Gerard Depardieu. In addition a subplot about a Jewish physicist trying to smuggle deuterium out of the country is introduced and eventually this becomes the main plot. The story has a lot of nice twists and turns a light sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy) and some genuine suspenseful moments. Together they create a nice package this is sure to please. ,positive
 The Vietnam War era is certainly far before my time but it has always interested me and I have seen many films about it. All of the others I'd seen had dealt strictly with the front-line of battle. When I read a description of The War At Home I found the concept intriguing. No Vietnam War movie I'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with. One night while flipping through channels the movie aired on The Sundance Channel. I set down the remote and settled back to watch it. I did not move from my seat during the entire two hours; it's one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there is no way to predict what is going to happen next. This movie made me a huge fan of Emilio Estevez. I had enjoyed him very much as Billy the Kid in the Young Guns movies but I never saw anything he did afterward. Emilio proved to be very talented at writing and directing as well as acting. The pacing of the movie is done extremely well. I am hard-pressed to think of a point where it drags. What amazes me is that it didn't get an Oscar or any real recognition when it came out. It is a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not who he used to be and probably will never be as they remembered him again. Definitely worth seeing. ,positive
 Meatballs has been a main staple in my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since. Bill Murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre-teen boy and befriends him while leading his CIT's into once mischievous scheme after another! The cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another sleazy dumb teen sex-fest. It is funny and sweet and just all-around fun. Anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves. It is a must-see. Watch out for Spaz - he is by far the best character! (Especially during the camp social - while Bill Murray hams it up for the camera - just watch Spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with!) By far one of my very favorite comedies of all time! ,positive
 When you have waited years to see a film that you have heard on the grape vine about obviously your expectations are high right? f**k yeah!But when this baby dropped through my door little did i know what f***ed up visuals would grace my TV and warp my fragile mind. First off Karim Hussein is a film fan like all of us growing up on a diet of Argento/Fulci/lynch etc.....and it shows in this film but in a good way. Although i didn't really know what the hell was going on on my first watch of this gem i was just amazed by the visuals the lighting and of course the performances from everyone who was involved Karim must have truly believed that he was going to push the boundaries in film-making(which trust me he does)and that he was going to have a hard job convincing the actors to do the same........ So what can i tell you about subconscious cruelty ?Well without spoiling it....its a deep insight into the human psyche with images of violent and sexual madness which toils into madness.....a truly unforgettable experience....... keep you eye on Karim Hussein he can only go onto better things..... I viewed the full uncut print of subconscious cruelty on a double disc DVD from Infliction films which is loaded with extras.....please note there is a censored hong Kong release out there avoid this version. ,positive
 One of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice. The final sequence with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted Poncelet committed and his own execution are just superb. No what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? It leaves you breathless they're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion. Tim Robbins put clear that he's not only a good actor he's a nice director as well. *My rate: 9/10 ,positive
 This is a film that I love above all others. I try to revisit the main film locations in Oakworth and Oxenhope whenever I can which help to re-establish those magical qualities that this film seems to embody so uniquely - recalling a gentler and more mannered age with its unspoken assertions that people really do matter that family life is not just another disposable and that life really is worth living (though sometimes we may doubt that). In short a film that soon brings tears to my eyes helped perhaps by the deeply evocative music - some tunes are jaunty (like the Perks' tune played on a trombone sometimes with spoons) the stirring melody when the family first set off for Yorkshire not knowing what lies ahead and the haunting little tune played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden child-felt changes in fortune. This is as much a film for adults as for children appealing to the eternal child in us all - a key that effortlessly reactivates those deep and apparently long-lost values and feelings buried inside us which are normally swept aside by the demands of modern everyday life. This is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we the viewers are left to make of it what we will and there are welcome touches of humour sometimes added for good measure such as the arrival of the aunt or on a more earthy level the bedroom scene on Perks' birthday - All right Bert - as it's your birthday! I must know every scene every line of this film and yet so great is the magic that each time I watch it is like I am opening a box of delights for the first time savouring each moment - sometimes humorous sometimes....well very different. As Peter says in the film: it's perfect - more perfect than you know . And so it is!!! ,positive
 My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We stumbled across it on a PBS station and they always ask when its on now. It reminds them of their Grandma that takes care of them everyday in the summer. Its funny too and sometimes they can't stopped talking about one scene or another. I would definitely recommend this show to all young kids. It is very clean and shows you to slow down and its not about watching TV all day long. When Nana reads a story it is slow and she talks about each page with Mona. It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book to my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of going through it quickly just to get them to sleep. ,positive
 This is a absolutely masterful stroke of genius by Paul Thomas Anderson the writer/director of this movie. It really examines the pluses and minuses of the world of porn and consequences for your actions living in a world literally fueled by sex drugs and rock n' roll. Only of the finest casts assembled with Mark Wahlberg Burt Reynolds Heather Graham Julianne Moore William H. Macy Philip Seymour Hoffman Don Cheadle Philip Baker Hall and others. ,positive
 WHENEVER an idea was successful during those Golden Days of the Silent Movies you could bet your bottom dollar that it would be repeated; although Reworking is the term that is used. Of course one could make the argument that this reworking business has never left us for success in the Movies or TV always leads to a trend; with all competing parties vying to come up with their own version of said hit Movie or TV Program. TO this last premise we strongly disagree; for this is copycatting or plagiarism plain and simple. THIS the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short surely must have been quite well received; for ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach/MGM 1929) was reworked on the Roach Lot not once but twice over the next three years. We were treated to LAUGHING GRAVY (Roach/MGM 1931) in which the Goat was replaced with a cute little puppy-dog. Also the weather is transformed into the dead of Winter in the middle of a blizzard. They also made other line-up changes with substituting Landlord Edgar Kennedy with Landlord Charlie Hall. THE second reworking of the hidden animal premise is the 3 Reeler THE CHIMP (Roach/MGM 1932) which substituted a female ape from a dissolved and defunct Circus to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The Circus paid off its employees with their assets and the Boys received the Chimpanzee as their final payday. BACK to our original 'victim' today's subject ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? THE short starts off simply enough. The boys encounter the Goat on the street and the Nanny in return follows them back to their rooming house; after Stan feeds a doughnut to her. The comic moments that follow are generated with the interplay between L & H and slow-burn exponent Edgar Kennedy their Landlord. The incident's impact is amplified by having the interplay occur at night. And as luck would have it; their room is situated directly above the Landlord's quarters. IN addition to the noise the bathing of the goat its odor and Landlord Edgar's suspicions about Laurel & Hardy's having another person illegally in the room; we were most amused by a little throw-away gag which may well have been missed by the Censors. While admonishing the boys about the noise they'd been making and reminding them of the house rules about any unauthorized person's being in there overnight regardless of their sex. ITS camera shot is made from inside The Boy's room over their shoulder. With Edgar in the hall and facing them he warns; Remember this is a respectable establishment! Just as he says this a lady clad in evening clothes walks across and behind the Landlord; followed by a uniformed Sailor who cocks his hat forward as they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ!! ,positive
 When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate. The college is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing. The school faces opposition from the proper college which ends up closing it down. The film ends on a high and i recommend you watching it. Its does have it flaws but it is a feel good cheerful film with a few unpredictable twists. ,positive
 Really enjoyed Manna From Heaven. If you liked My Big Fat Greek Wedding you will like this too! Once the story line is set it begins to keep you guessing the outcome. I think we'll be hearing more from Five Sisters Productions. I know I'll be watching for their next movie. ,positive
 this is one of my all time favourite films. its one of those films where i know every line but can still watch it repeatedly without losing interest. i always throw on this film if I'm going on holiday or if i don't want to go to the gym just seeing Nikki's gorgeous body will give me the motivation i need. Its an easy to watch film which always keeps me smiling but i know it wont be everyones cup of tea but if like me you love films that are shot beautifully and have comedy romance and an interesting plot you will love it. It is filled with great characters and Ben and Nikki are both gorgeous so anyone can stare at something appealing. BOTTOM LINE......YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT A TRY! I watched it on TV one day by fluke and loved it that i had to go out and track it down which took some time and i could watch it everyday. MY FATHER THE HERO I LOVE YOU!!! ,positive
 I have always loved Brenda Blethyn and Undertaking Betty was no disappointment. I saw it on Satellite on dreary Sunday morning. Life has been stressful and this movie made me laugh and see things we usually consider dire in a mirthful way. I wish she would make more movies like this and Saving Grace. Brenda Blethyn is a great gal for us approaching 60 to see in action. She is cute beautiful and full of life without appearing plastic and phony. Not many actresses are out there for us to relate to in a realistic yet comical and/or serious way. Brenda - if you see this - keep going with gems like this. We need more Mrs. Bennetts Bettys and Graces. ,positive
 A lot of 'alternative' comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular misguided overly-political and unfunny and the worst of the Comic Strip Presents... stuff fell into this category. But this is at the other end - a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels. Is Dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying? Is he telling the truth bluffing double-bluffing counter-doubly-bubbly-bluffingwhatever? I've probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times and I still can't decide 100%. That's the wonderful thing. As well as Ade Edmonson there are big roles for other early Comic Strip mainstays - French & Saunders Pete Richardson Alexei Sayle Keith Allen Nigel Planer and Robbie Coltrane though curiously enough not Rik Mayall. All of the Comic Strip cast - however much I disliked the hidden agenda of some of their members - are convincing actors and turn in superb performances in this big-screen outing while the Richardson-Richens writing team's work is so often pure genius with nice little touches of detail throughout. Ultimately this is a study of crime criminology and human nature in all it's wondrous complexity. And very funny with it. You will not be disappointed. ,positive
 Tiny Tweet and Sly the sneak are locked up in cages for a train ride to who knows where. Swinging Tweety begins belting out an insufferable song as soon as the train leaves the station so lets hope that Puddy Tad gets him this time. Sly tries out a couple of funny hand tricks but spoil sport conductor man puts the bird in a safer place amongst the baggage. The cat's next attempt has him ending up in the coal oven of the steam engine. And the chase is on. Of course there's a bulldog too and silly Sly just cant keep his big mouth shut. Next up the persistent pussy tries the old-stacking-of-the suitcases-bit (twice) producing a payoff Tex Avery would be proud of. Unfortunately for Sylvester that bulldog seems to be everywhere. He even displays a talent for shape shifting and producing enormous clubs from his back-pocket. Not even Sylvesters ability to outrun a speeding train can save him when he is thrown off Silver Streak style several times in a row. Arriving at Granny's new place (Gower Gulch population 86) the cat's final attempt involves cross-dressing. But you know what happens to men in dresses they always get more attention than they bargained for. 7 out of 10 ,positive
 I have to confess that I know some of those involved I was in the forerunner to The Planet Evil Unleased however this was more than 10 years ago and I had since lost contact with them. I happened to be watching BBC Scotland News and a piece regarding Scottish Cinema this mentioned and showed clips from The Planet and comments from it's director Mark Stirton this prompted me to order a copy of the film on DVD. Now to the film the level of acting writing directing and sfx is up there with some of the best around OK it's not Star Wars but I've seen many a Hollywood product that is far inferior. It is very strange watching a film spoken in my local North East Scotland accent but that soon passed. ^Mild Spoilers^ The Planet draws on several sci-fi classics; Star Wars Alien Pitch Black Forbidden Planet and Predator a handful of the merchant crew of a deep space transport ship survive their craft being attacked and destroyed by unknown ships they escape onto a deserted desert planet one by one they are killed by invisible attackers the ships only passenger a mysterious prisoner also makes it to the planet a battle ensues as the crew fight to survive. The Planet is a brilliant piece of sci-fi film making that certainly hides it's limited budget well done to Mark Mike and all those involved I look forward to your next work. ,positive
 It's what you expect. It induces laughter cringing and dry-heaving not necessarily in that order. It's over-the-top. You will see things that you may never be able to erase from your mind's eye. Jackass Number Two is better than the first; the actors definitely took more risks while filming this movie. There are many stunts which could have killed the actors especially Johnny Knoxville. The treatment of animals was suspect but other than that the movie achieved what is was made to achieve. If you like the preview see the movie. If you don't steer clear! 8 out of 10 ,positive
 A true comedy.The dialog is fast and very witty.Eleanor Parker at her physical peak .Flynn as only Flynn can be the charming rogue'..although now past his prime.. Most of the scenes between the principals are short so the movie moves well. If you haven't seen this movie please give a look.You will be surprised at Flynn's comedy timing.The scenes between him Tucker Parker and Cudddles Sakal are hilarious.Just on the basis of the outfits worn by the most attractive Parker this movie is worth a look.The romance of this 40's movie will not be lost on those so inclined to watch movies from Hollywood's golden past. My bet is that Never Say Goodbye won't disappoint. ,positive
 After the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident her young understudy Betty is brought to the forefront. That's very lucky for her with one problem: she has an admirer that has decided he will kill all her friends and make her watch. What is his connection to the opera and what is his fascination with Betty? I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan I think. Many people particularly critics praise his earlier work ( Suspiria and Deep Red ) but really frown on later films such as Sleepless which I liked. My favorite Phenomena is usually vastly underrated. Opera tends to fall somewhere in between. Some consider it one of his last great films others see it as part of his so-called decline. I loved it. The picture is crisp the music is great (unlike other critics I love the metal soundtrack) the female lead is someone I can feel for (not unlike Jennifer Connelly from Phenomena ). And the imagery... wonderful. Great cinematography and some amazing kill scenes. The concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they cannot blink... brilliant. My assistant Tina thinks this looked fake but even if it does the idea is more than enough to pay off. And some great effects like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth? Awesome. Jim Harper calls the film stunning and calls attention to the innovative cinematography well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders. I agree with this completely -- one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. Mike Mayo likewise calls it visually fascinating eye-candy and lauds the crisp editing and flowing camera-work . It's really a wonder that this is not one of Argento's more highly-praised works. Argento returned to the opera with Phantom of the Opera which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting this same year offered the release of Michele Soavi's Stagefright which (like Opera ) has a killer loose inside a theater killing off the people involved with the presentation. Both are great films with Soavi's more on the slasher side. (Soavi actually served as second unit director on Opera ... you can make your own conclusions.) My only complaint with this film is the length and pacing. While it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious they are not as frequent as they should be. The first one takes over a half hour and then we get down times between them. The lead actress should be in constant terror but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything is normal again. Not cool Dario. We need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high. ,positive
 For a long time I a fan of The Monkees TV series refused to watch Head because it was not about the TV show characters who were warm and wonderful. Head instead was said to be a cynical dark movie. Finally curiosity caused me to cave in. I didn't of course find a new episode to the TV show but a fascinating movie that appeals to my dark side. I have always been fascinated by dreams and Head was very much like watching someone else's dream with incomplete hints of stories and a small detail at the end of one scene causing the film to segue off in a new direction very much in a dreamlike stream of consciousness manner. The unfinished stories really make my imagination run wild time and time again! The film also features very striking beautiful cinematography the epitome being the black-on-white white-on-black look of Daddy's Song . The music is haunting especially the lush arrangement of The Porpoise Song . ( The Porpoise Song is the favorite song of my dark side while my bright side prefers Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah .) In the end I think the TV series could have used some of Head 's drama intrigue and intensity. But Head could have used some of the TV show's warmth humor and friendship. ,positive
 John Cassavetes is on the run from the law. He is at the bottom of the heap. He sees Negro Sidney Poitier as his equal and they quickly become friends forming a sort of alliance against a bully of a foreman played by Jack Warden. As someone who has worked in a warehouse myself when I was younger I can tell you that the warehouse fights complete with tumbling packing cases and flailing grappling hooks are as realistic as it gets. I've been in fights like these myself although no one got killed. The introduction of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variation on Shakespeare's Shylock Do I not bleed? This is an anti racist film which at the time was much needed. All the three principle characters - Warden Cassavetes and Poitier - are superb with Warden the most outstanding of the three. ,positive
 This HTV series is beautiful. I strongly recommend watching the movie. It has got everything it should: remarkable script strong characters beautiful scenery and exceptional atmosphere. Add some ambient score from Clannad and you receive unforgettable picture. I love every adventure movie from HTV I saw: Return To Treasure Island Smuggler Adventurer but Robin of Sherwood beats them all. I would like to thank the whole HTV production team and Richard Carpenter in particular for giving me plenty of adventures and excitement. I have got the DVD release in my little movie collection. I regret very much movies like these are not made anymore. ,positive
 Those who dislike this film seem to think that a loved one somehow 'belongs' to them and must be discarded if they go off with someone else. Fortunately human nature is much deeper than that; loving someone deeply inevitably brings suffering - though if we are fortunate only on their death. This film is true in setting atmosphere and dialogue to Nigel Balchin's original novel ('A Way Through The Wood') and by pinpointing a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the depiction of English upper class country life is very accurate). I loved the film and hope it will appear soon as an UK-compatible DVD ,positive
 I saw the trailer and read some reviews and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job all of them. The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from Ed and the new Apple computer ads. He was just coming into his own as an actor in Ed and he was excellent here. He's a natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who pulls no punches. He's on The Daily Show on Comedy Central about once every two weeks but he really shines in HBO's Red White and Screwed. I regularly catch him on XM Radio's uncensored comedy channel. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. Whether his rants and lines here are scripted or improvised are no matter. He's priceless delivering his thoughts on middle class angst. One thing about Black's delivery his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. It just seems like he's having a conversation with you and I think that makes him unconsciously more effective. ,positive
 It's said that this film is or was banned in the US since it was released. Since there is no information on IMDb I must rely on my other sources and believe it. If this is really true the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway. The movie is a so-called mockumentary although I think the topic is too serious call it like that. It creates a scenario where America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof. After an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park. In that they have to walk through the desert for three days to reach an american flag posted 50 miles ahead while they're are followed by police and army troops. The movie itself pretends to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both the tribunals and the hunting through the desert filmed by european film crews. All the facts are explained the interviewers ask questions and film everything. People stare directly into the camera shouting at it. It seems very very real. Talking about realism here is nonsense. This movie is not about how to make a realistic film it is about how such a film would look like if it was real. And it certainly would look like this. If it would be filmed anyway. In an 'utopian' state like this there surely wouldn't be a european film crew allowed to film those things. There are many things that frighten us. The defendants are people from all social classes. Political leaders musicians authors philosophists unemployed etc. They seem to be hopeless rebellious or scared. They are no heroes. They talk a lot in the tribunal knowing it doesn't lead to anything saying nevertheless all they said in speeches and books and songs before. One says he's not afraid to die. Is this true? Well he doesn't have to run through the desert hunted by cops. The defendants have no chance or at least their only chance the decision between prison and punishment park is no chance really. The way they decide in the end and the way film ends makes it clear that this kind of heroism is suicide. These tribunals remind us a lot of tribunals in the Third Reich. The officials use the same kind of idealistic speeching ignoring all the arguments from the defendants starting to scream at them and then telling them they should be quiet. They warn the defendants of watching their language and insult them much more. They ask them questions the defendants can not answer but it's never intendend they should. These scenes are a statement about what we call justice. The scenes in the desert are on a different level. When we see the prisoners for the first time we realize that they realize they haven't got a chance. Seeing the desert and the mountains feeling the sun and the thirst they don't have a clue how they should stand this free days. The film crew follows them and talks to them while they try to escape this madness. They argue should they play the game or escape or revolt? It all leads to the same and no one is surprised. Some will question if such parks would exist in reality in such a state? Why not? It empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they want to. It is not a gas chamber but the Nazis killed jews before concentration camps were built. The comparison is fair since they is no real difference. The movie is scary and depressing. The problems that are talked about sound to familiar to ignore. These is not science-fiction. Talking about poverty unemployment and crime is not utopic. The film shows us that government and democracy as it is presented to us is not only useless but dangerous. It also shows us that revolution is not definitely the solution. The defendants seem to be confused because they don't really know how to fight this. They do things but for nothing. Even is this delivers no solution to us it still is a statement. To me the most frightening thing is the fact of the banning of this movie. Here we have a film that accuses the loss of freedom moral and peace. It accuses the government a fictional goverment nevertheless to be dangerous and inhuman. And such a film is banned. Think about it when you see the american flag the next time. ,positive
 At times I really wonder when I look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than I have. I've just seen it... and liked it. Not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film! The film needs some patience yes. And yes the main character is REALLY annoying but that I'm sure is by intention. Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home. Most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music. This movie definitely doesn't fit as background noise. And no. Good directing doesn't mean having five laughs or explosions a second. Good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together. And while that doesn't work out perfectly at least I think it works quite good. I liked the photography and sets even if they brink on the surreal at times. The opening scene is really special. I also liked the acting  Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre. He is acting the role of a Pierre who is himself playing a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect. That even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself. People are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff: No character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone. And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen: Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone - and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war most likely Bosnia (which was still going on when the film was produced). At least that's what is hinted at by the story Isabelle tells Pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover which is surrounded by books on Bosnia. ,positive
 Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well at least with this installment the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far the most fun of the series and successfully if unintentionally bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot! Jesus the music scene's gone to h3ll since I've been dead! Chucky We needed the levity as the doll thing's getting old. The added comedic element and the better action scenes brings this one back up to equal the quality of the first when the idea was fresh and new-ish. 6.8/10 from... the Fiend :. ,positive
 Good footage of World War I-era ships and planes supplement this excellent war drama set in the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission must always come first. Robert Montgomery is the Lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role that a leader must play in combat. He makes bad decisions endangering the submarine and its crew but finally becomes a real man after he is court martialed and dismissed from the Navy. Robert Young plays a lieutenant junior grade and Jimmy Durante as a cook. Paralleling the war drama is an equally important wartime love triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans who plays Huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically injured aviator. Recommended. ,positive
 This is a pretty obscure dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades. It is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing I don't know. It is mesmerizing. I was impressed with the night time scenes because it actually looked like night unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime. I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule. There are a few scenes towards the end the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool. This movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat. I was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be. I couldn't take my eyes off of it and I had to ask myself why?  ,positive
 I shouldn't like Jackass Number Two. No one should. There is and never has been anything particularly redeeming about Jackass. And yet...it's one of the funniest things I have ever seen - and I simply cannot explain why. This new movie leaves the first one in the dust. It's so funny so horrible and so wrong. The whole team give their all - with Jackss in chief Knoxville leading the charge. He's nuts. I adore him but he's insane. And more power to him. With his burgeoning film career he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work but the fact that he threw himself almost literally back into the world of the 'Ass so wholeheartedly makes me oddly respect him. More kudos must go to Bam Margera who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted. Here Bam isn't the tormentor but the tormented and is all the better for it. I simply can't say what my favourite part is because I laughed the whole way through. Admittedly I viewed much of the movie from between my fingers but there hasn't been a 'real' movie I've seen in a very long time that made me feel as invigorated as this did. Love them or most probably hate them the Jackass team have delivered above and beyond my expectations. But I do agree with Bam. There can never be a Jackass number three because someone will die and I want these guys to stick around. ,positive
 Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with Mike Myers' 'Austin Powers' and Rowan Atkinson's 'Johnny English' and more recently Steve Carell in the big-screen version of the hit '60's show 'Get Smart!'. Back in 1974 it was David Jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attaché case full of documents marked 'Classified'. 'The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs' was his first starring role in a sitcom after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as 'Six Dates With Barker' the 'Doctor' series and 'Hark At Barker'. Humphrey Barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside Michael Palin Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's comedy show 'Do Not Adjust Your Set!'. 'T.T.S.L.O.E.B' cast Jason as 'Edgar Briggs' a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service. Whereas John Steed wore a bowler hat Briggs had a trilby. Whereas Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen Briggs owned a pipe. Objects fell to bits in his hands. He read Confidential documents in bed while his wife ( Barbara Angell ) perused Woman's Own ( on one occasion it would be the other way round ). When he tracked a pair of Russian agents to a heliport he accidentally switched on the airport's Tannoy system and broadcast his plans to capture them! When he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an S.I.S. man and his enemy-contact it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to Brighton! When he tried to organise the defection of a female Russian scientist he took a 'short cut' to elude his pursuers only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park. Yet like 'Inspector Clouseau' he always seemed to come out on top at the end much to the dismay of his colleagues. As previously mentioned he was married. His wife Jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did. Though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high-rise flat: Secret Service this Secret Service that! You never stop thinking about the Secret Service! . He shouted back: Think of the neighbours! They're not supposed to know I'm in the Secret Service! . Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included 'Coronation Street' villain Mark Eden ( he was the psychotic Alan Bradley ) as 'Spencer' Michael Stainton as 'Buxton' and 'Doctor At Sea''s Elisabeth Counsell as the lovely 'Cathy Strong'. They answered to 'The Commander' played by the late Noel Coleman. The Commander was kidnapped in one episode leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of the S.I.S. - which naturally horrified everyone. This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna who had written for the 'Doctor' series. Rather than spoof Bond it was more of a send-up of the serious spy shows such as 'Callan' ( though it had a Bond-style theme tune ). Furtive meetings in underground car parks code-breaking stolen missile plans that kind of thing. Jason brought a lot of energy to the role doing a lot of his own stunts such as Briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin and were reminiscent of those to be found in the 'Pink Panther' films. 'Briggs' had all the ingredients to be a smash-hit. Unfortunately it was not networked. In the London area it was put out on Sundays at 7.25 P.M. where it was trounced in the ratings by the B.B.C.'s soapy drama 'The Brothers'. It was then moved to Fridays at 7 P.M. because I.T.V. wanted to showcase its latest American import - the T.V. version of 'Planet Of The Apes'. Briggs never found an audience. A similar fate befell Jason's next major show: 1976's 'Lucky Feller'. It was not until 1977 and 'A Sharp Intake Of Breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle. You can see the title sequence ( along with two brief excerpts in German! ) for this series on YouTube. Unfortunately that is all you can see. Jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on D.V.D. A great shame. For the moment however Edgar Briggs' life will have to remain top secret. CODA: I have seen a number of episodes recently and I'm pleased to say it stands up incredibly well. ,positive
 Wow! I caught this on IFC recently after I watched But Im A Cheerleader. Id never heard of this movie but the description sounded remotely interesting. I went in with low expectations and now I must say this is one of the best love stories ever in film. Robin Tunney does an excellent job portraying a person with tourettes. The relationship between the two and just the slightest details in the film are so acurate and believable. I usually hate romance and love films but this movie truly touched me. I so recommend this movie to anyone with the ability of vision. ,positive
 Thorn-BMI is out of business before they stopped making films they made a chiller of a movie. Using E.S.P. and telekinesis as the basis of the daughter whose father mastered a terrible power. Only in the death of her father did Olivia find that her father dubbed 'Raymar' from Raymarkovitch had really murdered 6 girls and was planning two more by using the technique of Psyhic Vampirism. Our picture starts with 6 coroner wagons pulling in and music to match the grusome discovery of the 6 girls. Dead all with their eyes wide open in a closet. In the walls were all kinds of objects the coroners men were pulling up an old man when blue lightning hit the ceiling which caused a circular hole to form only made the film more bizarre! If you like extremely chilling scenes this for you. Unless you can see dead bodies from years ago in each level of decay don't view it without a friendly companion. Like The Changeling it has some heart stopping horror in it. I gave this a rating of 7 it's in color actress Meg Tilly debuted in this film if you can find it see it. ,positive
 this is an excellent movie i have been watching it since i was 6yrs old with my big sister. it is the type of movie that u can watch over and over again and still laugh smile and cry every time with out ever getting bored of it like other movie's. it is a movie that will live on forever through generations of family. i love it :) when ranking from 1-10 in my case i would rate it easily 9.9 every time. Itis a film about the change of a girl (baby) and her first boy-friend (Johnny)their relationships within the family the changes in baby's and Johnny's view of the world during their relationship. DIRTY DANCING WILL FOREVER LIVE ON AS A TIMLESS CLASSIC. thank-you sorry though for only the short comment. ,positive
 Have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here's hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot. May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the Film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors  ,positive
 First of all I'd like to say I'm just an amateur in commenting movies and that English is not my native language but that I felt a strong feeling compelling me to write about such movie; possibly as a way to thank and congratulate C. Jay Cox the cast and the crew for such a brilliant production. Yesterday I watched Latter Days for the first time. At first I thought it might be similar to the movie Priest which I liked very much for showing a gay priest out of the closet. But Priest maybe due to its restrict Catholic Ideological notions didn't supply my spectator's needs by revealing a profound sad end. Latter Days on the other hand broke that concept (and some other ones as well such as the Mormon's principles); presenting a tender and cheerful story leading it to a happy and emotive end and yet arousing a feeling of God's blessing and hope. A great movie indeed! Somehow Latter Days made me feel L.A. as a city of angels. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes astoundingly beautiful gay love stories! ,positive
 Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay and because of director's personal opinion regarding it Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve' to say so is not to say a little but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other. Wagon Master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a John Ford's film. Wonderful cast delivering his best thou not featuring any major stars except the most `fordian' of all actors  Ben Johnson. Very peculiar small characters who provide an obligatory comic relief and Wagon Master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing Sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell) in her shot but very inspired gigs. And last but not least legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth passage through it after Stagecoach My Darling Clementine Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. The film starts with two friends cowboys Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr) being hired to be Wagon Masters or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers who are headed to Silver Valley a place that's for them like a promised land. On their way they are joined by a very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. They are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into Cleggs a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the Marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery. Overall Wagon Master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of John Ford's wonderful Westerns. A must see. 9/10 ,positive
 *minor spoilers* You know it's getting to the point where Walt Disney Television Animation might just as well be called Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These sequels range from excellent ( Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas and the fantastic Lion King II: Simba's Pride ) to horrible ( The Return of Jafar ). (This is of course my personal opinion.) Now Disney brings us their latest sequel. Scamp's adventure and while it is flawed it is still entertaining. The quality of animation is not up to par with Disney Feature Animation; still the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not aged a day since 1955. Trusty still talks about his sense of smell and Ol' Reliable and Jock still gives him grief about it. There's a nice fight between Tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads (though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor.) I really don't care for most of the songs (though Roger Bart and Susan Egan--the singing voices of Scamp and Angel--sing their parts very nicely). Both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done much better work in the past. Danny Troob's score is okay but nothing memorable. And some of the junkyard gang seem like excess baggage; that is they really don't do much. The voice work on the other hand is quite good. While I don't like Jeff Bennett as the dogcatcher he is very good as Tramp. Chazz Palminteri does a nice job as Buster leader of the junkyard gang and Alyssa Milano gives what may be her best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the spitting image of his dad). He is voiced to PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf does a superb job of showing Scamp's wild streak and his soft side. All in all while Scamp's Adventure is flawed it still makes for rather entertaining viewing. It is my hope however that Walt Disney Television Animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases. ,positive
 Rugged David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and doddery Dr. Abner Perry (a delightfully dotty Peter Cushing) drill their way into the earth's core in their spiffy mole machine. The duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactyl men. Director Kevin Conner working from a blithely silly script by Milton Subotsky maintains a constant brisk pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with astonishing seriousness thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality that's amusing and endearing in equal measure. The lovably hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) funny. The cheesy array of cut-price creatures in particular are positively sidesplitting: cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes and a hilariously ludicrous fire-belching frog thing who blows up real good. One gut-busting highlight occurs when McClure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws. Moreover we also get some rousing rough'n'ready fisticuffs and an exciting climactic slave revolt. It's a total treat to see Cushing gleefully ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely but enthusiastic arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the flick. The ever-luscious Caroline Munro looks positively yummy as the fetching Princess Dia plus there are nice supporting turns by Cy Grant as gallant warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as treacherous coward Hoojah. Mike Vickers' neatly varied score alternates between jaunty orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. Alan Hume's crisp cinematography adds a glossy sheen to the infectiously inane proceedings. A complete campy riot. ,positive
 there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda that story told about young writer who is seekin' his place after a second war(he's survive german camp).excellent true atmosphere(action goes in camp for displaced placed) main hero(played by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski) finally fall in love but unfortunately his lady has been killed .there was beautiful scene when he is talking with american soldier and says (about death his girl) nothing is happen simply you're shootin' to us now... he's condition of soul has been destroyed. 10/10 ,positive
 This film does not have the outstanding visuals that American Beauty or The Ice Storm offered and because it was made after those films it cannot be marked as very original either: the music though subtly brilliant sounds very much like that of American Beauty. The story has some similarities with The Ice Storm in particular (as well as Sigourney Weaver). Without intent perhaps the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much. At times the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than it's bigger more successful brothers by having too much going on or by not delivering the most effective dialogs. Here the writing cannot measure with that of American Beauty. But that can be said about most movies ever made even the best and there is still a lot to like: said music score and (expectable given the cast) effective performances. Of note is Emile Hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding Into The Wild . Overall I can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though it's not the first one on a list of must-sees which would be topped by: 1 American beauty 2 The Ice Storm 3 Little Children. After you've seen and liked those check out this one. ,positive
 The Student Nurses is an excellent film that deals with four women bonded by friendship and career. For the first time one is able to see a realistic portrayal of relationships inside the work place outside the work place the risks of those relationships and the consequences. This film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress Katherine Scottie MacGregor as the nurses' instructor Miss Boswell. Ms. MacGregor is best known for her performance as Mrs. Oleson on the television series Little House on the Prairie. The direction music and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by Clancy B. Grass III. This film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s which offers a softer side to life while appreciating the beauty of the female sex. ,positive
 I must say I thought the show Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I am part of a sorority I didn't want them to make Greek organizations look bad.... but I think Greek is hilarious. Yes they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it's not mocking but just cute humor. All the characters are pretty likable minus Rebecca Logan (I just can't stand her) Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there is Cappie. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie haha His character brings so much to the show. Rusty's room mate Dale played by Clark Duke is hilarious as well. It's definitely fun to watch so tune in for season 2. I can't wait till it is back on!! ,positive
 Superb silent version of the story of Francois Villon. Although remade in the thirties as IF I WERE KING with Frank Lloyd directing Preston Sturges scripting and Ronald Colman starring this version is even better. Barrymore with a cohort of comedians plays the comic fool and the wine-depressed Villon with a verve that Colman could not match. The photography is startling in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast particularly Conrad Veidt in his American premiere the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day and the supporting comics Slim Summerville and Hank Mann steal every scene they are in. It is a shame that Barrymore did so few first-rate comedies. Among his sound films only his lead in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can compare to this and those stand up only because of his superb voice. In this silent movie Barrymore must tell his tale without benefit of words and he does so alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the King of the Fools and tenderly as Villon in love. He even gets to leap around in the swashbuckling style of Fairbanks most convincingly. He also lets his supporting cast have their share of glory capering in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the era. Finally a brief word about Alan Crosland a director known today only for directing the first talking feature THE JAZZ SINGER in the same year this was released. Crosland was a careful innovative delightfully original director and it is a shame that more of his works are not known. Perhaps this movie far more interesting as a movie than his best-known work will be your introduction to his other talents. If so you could do far worse. ,positive
 This is a great TV miniseries of a classic novel. Janet McTeer and John Bowe in the lead roles are exceptional. This is one of the best adaptations from a book that I have seen. I would LOVE to get a copy of this - let me know if you know how I might get one...Thanks! ,positive
 Back in the 70's a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years. Before viewing his first film Don't Look In The Basement I wasn't too sure what to expect but I sure as hell didn't expect it to turn out to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre. I don't know this might actually be my all-time favorite horror movie. We begin in an isolated insane asylum. At first it seems like a rather laid-back place to get mentally healthy considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot as if it were their house (I guess it is). none of them seem all that dangerous only delusional. The residents include a love-nympho a 700 year old woman a man-child a spaz a guy who thinks he's in a war a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks he's a judge. One day out of nowhere Judge kills the doctor with an axe shortly thereafter the wanna-be baby mama kills the nurse. Ten minutes into the movie and things are looking really ugly. Perhaps the new nurse will know what to do then again perhaps not. Giving away more would do more harm than good. It's best to plunge head first into this one knowing as little as possible. If you can appreciate honest-to-God untampered with horror then you will not be disappointed. If you liked Scream if you liked Wrong Turn if you go for that unoriginal over-produced over-scored digital Hollywood garbage then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one. Don't Look In The Basement being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking. The atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove. Unfortunately good ol' S.F. used up most of his good ideas on his first movie although the next entry in his Texas-sized quadrilogy is somewhat of a masterpiece that is if you're into extra sleazy mean-spirited Hixploitation like someone I know. If you fall in love with Brownrigg's first two and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer check out Don't Open The Door and The House Where Hell Froze Over. Don't Look in The Basement has everything that successful horror needs no stars no budget no digital effects just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum with a dozen cast members and a somber subtle score and of course the twist. This is real horror for the real horror fan. 10/10 ,positive
 I think that this short TV series was absolutely wonderful and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money! I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life! In this documentary Attemborough almost certainly lived up to his high reputation. This was a masterpiece and will always be considered to be one of the best modern documentaries Many congratulation's to the 'Blue planet' team. ,positive
 The movie Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie on a low budget e.g American Beauty and Blair Witch Project. The Director Fridrik Thór Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheimsins a new life on the white screen. The movie is a breakthrough in Icelandic film making because it's the biggest and the greatest movie that has been done in Iceland. The music in the film played by Sigurrós is very symbolic for the film it is absolutely brilliant. I recommend everybody who are able to think to go and see this film as soon as possible you won't be disappointed. I would bet on this film to win the best foreign film award next year  all over the globe! ,positive
 I would purchase this and Thirty Seconds Over Toyko today if available. I also saw this movie after seeing large billboards of Jack Webb in his Dress Blues on the highway at the age of 12.Always admired Jack Weeb as a John Wayne type and American all the way. Almost became a Marine just because of this movie but served instead in the Air Force Air Force Reserve and Army Reserve for 32 years. Have not seen this movie on TV at all and would love to own it on DVD. At least if it was on TV I would copy it to VHS and use it until available on DVD. I also have a large collection of WWII and Korean War movies and always look for new releases on DVD. ,positive
 ...And there were quite a few of these. I do not like this cartoon as much as many others partly because it was made in its period. I much prefer cartoons with Daffy and Bugs which are fifteen or so years before-hand. Many people will like this particularly people who always find violence funny cartoon or not. The basic plot is a pretty well known one for Looney Tunes: Elmer goes out hunting Daffy leads him to Bugs and Daffy ends up being shot instead. Also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes (some do not enhance the episode) ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre. The plot is mainly geared by jokes - each joke keeps the episode going. This way of plot-going is not all that unusual in Looney Tunes (of course if you are pretty much a Looney Tunes boffin - or an eager one - like me then you'll know this already). For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and like the sound of what I have said about it enjoy Rabbit Seasoning ! 7 and a half out of ten. ,positive
 I heard about this series in 2001 which a friend of mine was recording off the television each week. I never bothered to watch though I became acquainted with the series through the magazine which I looked at every now and then in bookstores. I recently purchased series one on DVD and have become addicted to this fascinating and original series. The characters at first seem unlikeable but it is amazing how fast they grow and develop into a united force. As they begin to care for one another it becomes easy to care what happens to them (bearing in mind that this is only a TV series and they are fictional). However it isn't the PC world of Star Trek and so whilst every character shows a good trait they each have their own flaws and demons that they must deal with. Indivual story lines mixed in with an overall multiple story-arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I absolutely enjoy watching each of the characters interact with one another. This strange new world we are introduced to is brilliantly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut John Crichton and as he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy strange alien creatures different cultures being hunted by a character that wants him dead and being treated as inferior by his comrades we can easily relate to what he must be feeling. As he becomes used to his surroundings so do the viewers and his compassionate strong-willed and brave character is a joy to watch. I have watched only seven episodes of Farscape season one and look forward to continuing through seasons two-four and the mini-series. Maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five. Highly recommended viewing and well worth setting time aside to watch. Buy and enjoy! 10/10. ,positive
 I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more Hollywood . James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film. Brenda Fricker plays a small role but as usual she is outstanding. This is a movie for everyone to see just how lucky we all are. If you like Awakenings and Mask you will enjoy this story. You owe it to yourself to check this film out. ,positive
 In complete contrast to the previous correspondent here I thought Shoppen Munich (as it was billed when shown with English subtitles here in London at the German Film Festival in November 2007) was very funny very well acted and excellently scripted. It's quite audacious to design a 100-minute film that consists exclusively and relentlessly of talking heads. But I think Ralf Westhoff succeeded with wit and élan. No standard filmic devices of say following a character's soul-baring pronouncement with some meditative minor-seventh-chord music and long-shot nature cutaways. But when someone said something that revealed their souls - well we were hustled on by the man with the timer for yet another superficial introduction. Which is of course the point: the hurtling tickbox superficiality of thirtysomething urbanites where everything is down to a quick question and answer. Maybe most films are so clichéd and stupid that we English are ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and uncontrived cinema but I can promise you that at the screening tonight (Curzon Cinema Sun 25 Nov 2007) the full audience bellowed with laughter most of the way through. So I wasn't the only one guffawing! My girlfriend (who speaks German and has lived in Munich) thought it was hilarious. I (who don't speak German and have not been to Munich I think) thought it was hilarious. I'd recommend Shoppen (Munich) to anyone (especially couples...) looking for a smart witty original wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the bewilderment of the generation who feel they've missed out on the happy-ever-after stuff first time round. NB In the English subtitled showing in London the subtitles (which were very good) were shown completely underneath the slightly reduced picture not inside it. I thought this was a Good Thing. ,positive
 Rowan Atkinson's creation Mr.Bean has stood the test of time and will be forever etched upon the memory of those who viewed it. Living alone and appearing not to have a job of any description Mr.Bean goes around doing day to day activities in a rather comedic fashion.The mistake prone Mr.Bean induces heartfelt laughter when put even in the most simplest situations.Though he barely spoke any coherent words his jovial actions more than made up for this. Even when driving in his beloved Mini Mr.Bean still manages to cause inadvertent chaos.Not very much is known about his background but his ability to draw tears of laughter from the audience at his funny shenanigans is well known. Before he found fame Nick Hancock can be seen in a couple of the episodes ,positive
 I am not a footie fan by any means but watched this with a friend as there wasn't anything else on the box at the time.(thank goodness). Not only did we laugh from start to finish but about a week later in the pub when we started discussing it we made a right spectacle of ourselves with uncontrollable laughter. Does that sloping pitch actually exist??? I have released my e-mail here so if anyone hears about it's future availability or a repeat on the telly please let me know. Definitely the funniest thing I've seen on television!!! King Leek was good too!! another Tim Healy classic ,positive
 Directed by a veteran Hollywood director Henry King who began his career still in 1915 Love is a Many Splendored Thing was one of his last great films. It was based on a bestseller by Han Suyin called simply A Many Splendored Thing the phrase that was borrowed by the author from the poem The Kingdom of God by Francis Thompson where that many splendored word `love' was used in quite a different and rather transcendental context meaning the love of God. Made in the 50s the film marked along with works by such directors as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli a sort of renascence of melodrama its florescence and reaching yet again a peak of popularity. The story begins when a handsome American reporter Mark Elliott played by William Holden yet once again typecast in one of his irresistible `playboy' roles comes to the Hong Kong and meets there a young and pretty Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) of half-Chinese half-English origin who is working as a doctor at a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by the Chinese communists. Instantly Mark feels a rather strong attraction towards her but at the beginning his deep feelings are not quite reciprocated by Han's heart left cold after the death of her husband (`I believe in human heart now only as a doctor'). But very soon she yields to the persistent courting of tempting as hell Mark and both of them enter a passionate relationship apparently stoppable by nothing even by the fact that Mark is unhappily married and his wife doesn't want to give him a divorce or social differences and prejudices caused by Han's Chinese origin. But still it's the fate that has a final word to say in determining the fairness of the eternalness of such a blissful loving relationship for no matter how enduring the two assume it to be the merciless time is waiting in a rather alarming form of death prepared at any given moment to prove its impermanence. Undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made Love is a Many Splendored Thing features fine performances from William Holden and Jennifer Jones wonderful Academy Award winning musical score by Alfred Newman and extremely romantic touching heart-warming but ultimately heart-breaking story. Don't miss that many splendored film. 8/10 ,positive
 Mike Nichols in finest form. I was not a fan of Closer so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances. Just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but Nichols and his very strong A-list cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling Congressman. Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant - here playing a damaged but ultra-smart CIA manipulator and it is in the exchanges between Hanks and Hoffman's characters where the comedy soars. Rarely is movie humour laugh-out loud and also smart... This hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world (often simultaneously). One other major plus is the length of the picture. The film is based on George Crile's fat book of the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame is The West Wing ) must have been to make a fat movie but what we get is a breath-taking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implications. This film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of it's sparkling witty script - even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that Herring and Wilson provide and the ultimate consequences (9/11). ,positive
 Most of Kieslowski's films seem like puzzles to me meant to expand mind and soul. The characters are not very believable are idealized are schematic. Nevertheless the way Kieslowski presents their winding ways through life their complicated interaction with others with the universe with chance or destiny makes me understand faith makes me (want to) believe in God. That at some point it all has a meaning if not to me then certainly to someone. Trois couleurs and especially Rouge comes closer to making me touch feel experience the truth the meaning than perhaps any other of his films. The only problem being the paths of the puzzles explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable. There is still plenty of joy to be had here. It is like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect and it delivers sometimes with a newly found bouquet which might come from aging - either the wine or yourself. ,positive
 A slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where Max is choosing a ring in a jeweller's shop. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's A Mid-summer Night's Dream in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's girl-friends. Here Max and Lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with Lisa and Alice and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. On top of the merry mix-up Max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago. And because Max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film I wasn't quite sure if I was in the present or the past.There is much running down corridors stairways through doorways into elevators etc. I accept all that in a fast-paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other? After four collisions it ceases to have any impact if you'll excuse the pun. High marks for art design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor but I do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in Paris. Saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when Max almost exits at the same time. However a kiss or two soon makes him feel better. If you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks you'll finally find yourself at the airport where Max's devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss. It can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love like Puck in a Mid-summer Night's Dream . ,positive
 Over 21 the film version of the Ruth Gordon play which detailed her experiences trying to keep the marriage together with Garson Kanin after he'd gone in the service provides Irene Dunne with one of her better later roles on the big screen. It's also in keeping with what was then an upbeat spirit in America about how we would not screw up the peace as we did in the first World War and sow the seeds of yet another global conflict. The play Ruth Gordon wrote and starred in herself ran for 221 performances in 1944 on Broadway and was confined simply to the bungalow that Gordon and Harvey Stephens who was the male lead had on a training base. If you look on the Broadway credits list it says that the production was 'staged' by George S. Kaufman as opposed to being directed by him. I'm not sure of the distinction but I can imagine that with a wit and will as strong as Kaufman's it must have been an interesting period putting the production together before opening night. When Columbia bought the screen rights Sidney Buchman had to do some considerable script reconstruction to move the action beyond the bungalow. The film bears very little trace of its stage origins. Alexander Knox plays the husband and Charles Coburn the employer of both Dunne and Knox who are writers. Knox has graduated to not only editor but featured columnist. His words and thoughts help sell the paper and Coburn is in a bind. But Knox feels he has to get into the war the seminal event of his time in order to speak authoritatively on the kind of post war world he wants. This was not an uncommon theme in those years. Irene Dunne has some good comic moments the kind she used to have when she was appearing opposite Cary Grant. In fact Garson Kanin directed both of them in My Favorite Wife a few years earlier. Coburn is his usual cantankerous old water buffalo of a boss who ultimately has a good heart. Over 21 was an optimistic picture which sad to say wasn't accurate about what the Allies and I mean all of them could bring to the peace conferences to create a better world. Still hopefully a new generation will get it right. ,positive
 I did something a little daring tonight when I watched this movie. I attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores. Sure when this film originally was distributed a piano score was probably played with it. Oftentimes the director would choose the score himself (Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released. And then again there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score. I do not know the history of Potemkin's score so I decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within - film. Soon after I turned the music off unaided (or should I say unimpeded) by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen I became utterly attached to the film. Visually it is easily one of the most stunning of all films. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The editing possibly the cinematic technique Eisenstein is most famous for (montage) is extraordinary. The mood of this film is anger and it stirred my passions violently. It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film especially a drama but films like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this film! Your education is incomplete without it. ,positive
 Better than I expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage. The music is great and cinematography focuses greatly on turning Ricci into a trailer trash Betty Paige and it works. Samuel L. get's to shout a lot which he's good at as well as play lots of blues guitar which he looks cool doing. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. I get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s*%# but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche while still being an effective drama. ,positive
 Hey; Belmondo! Look there's Anna Karina! Great American improvised New Wave (or Independent you want to call it that) not as good as Godard or Truffaut and not flawless but hey such realism style warmth and humor. I love that NY accent; you don't know nothing! ; forget about it . Just like the French New Wave it's about young people; partying falling in love or just hanging around. Lelia Goldoni is so cute; she's adorable; wonderful. Ben Carruthers' also good reminds me of Belmondo. A film you won't forget. A steady 26.5 out of 31 ;-) ,positive
 Bridget Fonda has disappointed me several times over the years but she had my attention in BREAK UP. It's true the story is missing critical details in several places but I just kept scrutinizing Fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didn't let me down. The look in her eyes in the last scene as she musters up courage to literally put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting ever. I believed her completely possibly because I've known and admired several tough broads who survived similar abusive situations. And they did this without becoming man-haters but that's my own hopeful projection of Fonda's character at the BREAK UP. ,positive
 Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired Geishas. Whatever happens when such a woman ages and loses her charm and mystique? Well for those who are interested watch this film. One: Okin is successful as a money-lender but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful. Okin doesn't have any children but the other do. Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her and is excited. Naruse is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists' characters. Bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness and one's life-worth. Very good film indeed. ,positive
 I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run. If this movie didn't excite your curiosity then you were just too old. I look forward to seeing it again (even at my age)! If nostalgia is in your venue I'm sure this is an interesting movie to see. It's innocence is simply astounding and it's simplicity is so easy and enjoyable. ,positive
 The Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu (1976) is a vastly underrated early work by director John Woo. The film stars Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-liang) and features Jackie Chan Sammo Hung and James Tien in significant supporting roles. Many people believe or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising that this is a Jackie Chan film. This is not a Jackie Chan film Dorian Tan is the star but Jackie gives one of his best (most serious) early performances. The Hand of Death is about a Shaolin disciple named Yunfei (Tan) who is sent on a mission to assassinate a Shaolin traitor named Shih Xiaofeng (Tien) and protect a revolutionary named Zhang Yi (Woo). Along his journey Yunfei meets up with a young woodcutter named Tan (Chan) and a disgraced sword fighter (Chang Chung) known as the wanderer. Both men have suffered at the hands of Shih and want to take revenge. The three team up to defeat Shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety. The martial arts action is above average under the direction of Sammo Hung. Dorian Tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the Northern eighteen styles kicks along with some Southern five styles boxing. Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well. James Tien is not the greatest martial artist on the Jade screen but does an acceptable job. Some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring Chan Tan and Hung are very good. Director John Woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film which is refreshing. The cinematography by Leung Wing Kat is very stylish unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era. Joseph Koo's music: a combination of soft flutes and 70's Shaft style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best. Hand of Death is not Jackie and Sammo's usual kung fu comedy. Hand of Death is a serious straightforward revenge driven story. Hand of Death aka Countdown in Kung Fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hung's great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and Chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen. Hand of Death is a solid stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary John Woo. Kung Fu Genre Rating 7.5/10 Wanderer to Tan (referring to his new weapon): The Little Eagle Wing God Lance. Tan: Just a knickknack.  ,positive
 This movie was clearly an early attempt for a new director but still succeeded in being original and entertaining as well as in some moments thought-provoking. However I have to say the story would not have come across as well without the stellar performance of Paul Anthony as Pip. He made the well written parts very believable and affecting and the more weakly written parts much more bearable. Also I have to mention the performance by Alan Cumming. It was refreshing to see him in a part like this. He brought a weight to his role that provided a very grounding element to the film. As for Paul Anthony: Who is this guy? Why haven't I seen more of him? Someone give him more roles please! ,positive
 At first I didn't think I would like this movie but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating but soon he grew on you. The twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the Germans. I would like to see this again to follow all the side plots. I also want to buy the sound track to hear the music again. ,positive
 Sweet entertaining tale of a young 17 1/2 year old boy controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and withdrawn father and how he finds himself through his work with a retired eccentric and tragic actress. Very well acted especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of the teenage boy well showing his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter series of films. Laura Linney plays his ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption so there's no room to like her at all. But the film is a very entertaining film made well by the British in the style of the likes of Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls. ,positive
 I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end. But what are they? Well it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original but it is better presented than other films of its kind. The three main stars (Whalin Johnson Long) put in fairly decent performances that more than make up for the distinct lack of quality from the supporting cast (the fat cop and Coach Quinn really bugged me) and the scripting is slick and witty (even if it is poor in places). The bottom line is though this film is so CUTE: I grinned all the way through it and it has a place in my video collection purely because it could cheer up anybody. You really have to be some kind of humourless bore not to like this (I DARE somebody to sit through this without grinning!!!). I do recommend this one if you want a simple fun and - above all - enjoyable watch. You won't regret it! ~Top$~ ,positive
 Thank god for this movie. It's a document of talent that three decades later seems even more unique and rare in retrospect. The music is just extraordinary packed with so much talent in writing performance arrangement and production that it's absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances by under-appreciated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods uplift my spirit every time I hear them. While the film may be different from the stage version I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album which I find truly grating and under-developed. Here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldn't have been produced in a stage setting. But the music isn't the only thing extraordinary about this movie. The juxtaposition of almost hyper-realist dialog scenes (reminds me of Altman films) intercut with exuberant musical and dance numbers really works. All the talent in this movie--directing writing photography editing music choreography casting acting costuming art direction--merge perfectly into one of the best musical films I've seen. I think it's amazing how much we know about the characters in Hair based on very little information or plot. They're not drawn as caricatures but as realistic and very human people. We see little glimpses of where they come from but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting directing and editing. There's an undercurrent theme of the misogyny of Berger and Hud which colors their characters by exposing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. The scene of Berger's home life reveals important details about his psychology and the brief glimpse of Claude's home tells us volumes about his background through the simple realistic and genuine interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father. I love the fashion in this movie. It defiantly mixes sixties ideas with VERY seventies looks (one does have to overlook Treat Williams' hair extensions...). It's a document of how chic much of the late-seventies was contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste. Claude's beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979 and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers (particularly those in white during the Central Park scene) mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musical's themes. These elements merge with Twyla Tharpe's extraordinary state-of-the-art choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both. Hair isn't a film that rewards cynicism. If you come to it with expectations then you're most likely going to be held captive by artists who aren't bound by your rules. For me it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day. ,positive
 Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir the beginning middle and end of the story intertwine) and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale told with more flair energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento which turned me on to Nolan in the first place. Can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box-office stars) in his next film Insomnia. ,positive
 This film has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of film buffs and it's a crying shame. Its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond's adaptation and Ingrid Bergman's flawless performance. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn at such a young age to work with Bergman looking more than a decade younger than her 54 years--fifty four! When she's on the screen it positively twinkles. This is a film which may appear dated at first but it actually made me wish I was around during the swingin' 'sixties. Hawn's fashions are as tacky as Bergman's are chic. (That's one minor flaw--isn't her character a little too soignée for a gal who still lives with her sister? But then again would we have Ingrid any other way?) And who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called The Slipped Disc? The best compliments I can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that I never saw and that it left me wanting more. Speaking of wanting more I wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor Rick Lenz? (He resembles Griffin Dunne in this film.) This was his film debut and I don't see any other major roles in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed but I can't imagine any other actor in the role either. Since the movie is based on a play the line delivery may seem a bit stage-y but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all. In fact I am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty-five years. Because this film represents a bygone era it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs. It is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed. But don't let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer. Grade: A ,positive
 Just as in Columbo we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies sex blackmail and murder. The investigating officer Adam Arkin is even somewhat of a fumbler not unlike Columbo . It is William H. Macy as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his perfect crime . William H. Macy fans will enjoy A Slight Case Of Murder as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities. Add some well timed comedy and this is very similar to a fine episode of Columbo . Highly recommended. - MERK ,positive
 The eighth and thus second-to-last short of the Animatrix ones this is the only one quite like this. This takes two of the main types of filmed entertainment inspirations of The Matrix and combines them unbelievably well. This is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect the tone. The animation is a gorgeous breathtaking Animé. The style which is omnipresent in this is Noir. The plot is fitting and the story-telling as well as the music is spot-on. The sound in general is fantastic and really helps solidify the mood and atmosphere along with the drawings and designs. The voice acting is impeccable. This is one of only two where people also in the movies reprise their roles and both have Anne-Moss who is the only of them appearing in this. This is one of the best of the nine and also one of my personal favorites. This is about ten minutes long. The pacing is perfect. It never slows down terribly much but it's not overwhelming either. The ending could not have been more appropriate for this. This shares a nine and a half-minutes long making of with Kid's Story and it's well-done and informative. I recommend this warmly to any fan of the universe and the two genres that this is made up of. 8/10 ,positive
 The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything trusting each other completely. I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother named Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and the daughter named Rory (short for Lorelai played by Alexis Bledel) are both very beautiful women they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters such as Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai like each may be even love each other but neither of them really acts on it. They have their little moments. There are some other supporting characters most of them very funny and with their won touching moments. What I like the most I think is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult. The dialogue between them is quick sharp funny and sometimes touching as well. The band they have is beautiful. The Gilmore Girls makes you feel good so try it. ,positive
 Oliver Stone always ready to make politically-themed movies makes another one here. Talk Radio is loosely based on the career of Alan Berg a radio talk show host in Denver who was murdered by white supremacists. In this case the character is Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian) an outspoken talk show host in Dallas who loves nothing more than to irk the people who call in. As it is most of the people who call in are a bunch of pigheaded racists. And things may be heating up more than anyone realizes. Bogosian's performance brings a light comical tone to an otherwise serious movie. I really liked the scene where he jabs at a redneck who calls in. Granted I wouldn't call this Oliver Stone's greatest movie ever but it's a good reference in an era when media gets more and more concentrated. Good performances by Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help. ,positive
 I taped this on Sundance and had no idea that it was a Miike film. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. Then I saw things like the dancing sax player who sounded like an Oriental Gato Barbieri and I knew this had to be Miike. I missed the beginning opening credits and had to wait till the very end of the closing credits to see Miike's credits. So far he hasn't disappointed me yet. Audition City of Lost Souls Ichi the Killer and The Happiness of the Katakuries were all good flicks and now I've found out that this was the third in a trilogy. Other than Miike and Todd Solendz there's nobody making interesting films nowadays. ,positive
 When you think 'Oliver Stone' the movies that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial ones like Platoon JFK Born On The Fourth Of July or Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio usually doesn't. It's a pretty small movie actually. More than half the movie takes place with Barry Champlain at his radio station talking into his mike. But believe me this is one of Oliver Stone's greatest movies and should NOT be missed. Above all things it's a character study. Barry Champlain is a rude self-destructive risk-taking talk radio show host who says one too many things and starts to get in trouble with his boss his lover(s) his fans and even some Nazis. He doesn't like his audience and callers and a lot of them don't like him (eithor that or do like him but have no idea why). But at the end he says on his show: I guess we're stuck with each other. See Talk Radio even if you don't like Oliver Stone movies. You might be surprised. I sure was. My Rating: 10/10 ,positive
 I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the Batman series Spawn Judge Dredd and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story how difficult is that? And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence blood martial arts weapons fire the good against evil etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies and most of them have bombed. But not Blade the movie was filmed just right not going overboard delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time. ,positive
 In many ways the filmic career of independent film-making legend John Cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock the consummate studio director. Where Hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle Cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally. Where every element in a Hitchcock shot is composed immaculately Cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt or what it conveyed emotionally. Hitchcock's tales were always plot-first narratives with the human element put in the background. Cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films. If some things did not make much sense logically so be it. One can see this even from his very first film 1959's Shadows filmed with a 16mm hand-held camera on a shoe string budget of about $40 000 in Manhattan with Cassavetes' acting workshop repertory company and touted as an improvisatory film. The story is rather simple as it follows the lives of three black sibling Manhattanites- Benny (Ben Carruthers)- a trumpeter and no account Hugh (Hugh Hurd)- a washed up singer and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni)- the younger sister of both. The film's three main arcs deal with Hugh's failures as a nightclub crooner and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny's perambulations in an about Manhattan with his two no account pals; and Lelia's lovelife- first with a white boy Tony (Anthony Ray) who does not realize light-skinned Lelia's race even after bedding her; then with stiff and proper Davey (Davey Jones) who may be a misogynist. In the first arc nothing much happens except dark-skinned Hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs and opening shows for girly acts. He dreams of making it big in New York or even Paris but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill for the one time we actually get to hear him sing he shows he's a marginal talent at best. That Rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work. But this is the least important of the three arcs. While this film is better overall than say Martin Scorsese's first film a decade later Who's That Knocking At My Door?- another tale of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers it has none of the brilliant moments- acting-wise nor cinematographically- that that film has. It also is not naturalistic for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve especially in film although the 1950s era Manhattan exteriors at ground level is a gem to relive. While Shadows may indeed be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit it certainly is nowhere near a great film. Parts of it are preachy poorly acted scenes end willy-nilly almost like blackout sketches and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle. All in all it's a very sloppy job- especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film as Cassavetes proved that as a director at least in his first film he was a good actor. The only reason for anyone to see Shadows is because Cassavetes ultimately got better with later films and this gives a clue as to his later working style. The National Film Registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as 'culturally significant'. This is all in keeping with the credo of art Cassavetes long championed as typified by this quote: 'I've never seen an exploding helicopter. I've never seen anybody go and blow somebody's head off. So why should I make films about them? But I have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way. I've seen people withdraw. I've seen people hide behind political ideas behind dope behind the sexual revolution behind fascism behind hypocrisy and I've myself done all these things. So I can understand them. What we are saying is so gentle. It's gentleness. We have problems terrible problems but our problems are human problems.' That this film is 'culturally significant' is true but that truth is not synonymous with its being 'artistically significant'. It is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives. ,positive
 This film is a knockout Fires on the plain referred to is (the burning off at the end of harvest time) A happy memory for Tamura He relives this in his mind many time's and at the end of this bleak film Like a man dying of thirst he believe's he is home and this last illusion is all he has left. Billy Wilder's The Big Carnival (Ace in the hole) is the only film (that comes to mind)that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by Kon Ichikawa. While I think the whole film is brilliant Two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (Crawling on there belly's)are ambushed by Americans and massacred True Horror And as an American soldier and a pretty Philippine Girl soldier are having a cigarette on the side on the road she smiles as she flits with the yank then her face Changes to rage as she see's two Japanese soldiers trying to surrrender she grabs a gun and kills them with joy The American soldier attempts to stop her but has no chance to me this speaks volumes at the atrocity's committed by the Japanese in the Philippines all in all a great film if you have the stomach for it. ,positive
 Based on a True Story . . . The premise of this film is to illustrate that through fairly normal events its possible for an outwardly 'decent' mother to get drawn into Heroin addiction. ***semi spoiler*** Some of the scenes are fairly inaccurate - whilst others almost make you want to get the 'fix' yourself. Computer technician/graphic artist woman with good relationship with her young teen kid spirals into addiction after work colleague who is a 'chipper' (-someone who can take + enjoy it now and again - ) Then spirals into an addiction that leads her eventually to scoring off 'street' dealers after losing contact with her steady dealer. The scenes that show her coming down and getting 'sick' are often VERY real - especially the first real 'night sweat' Prior to all these events she began a relationship with a guy who just happened to have lost his wife to the bottle and insists he has an inner radar not to get hooked on such women. Some radar! However after after some late turn ups and weird behaviour the boyfriend challenges her as to 'what is going on' His radar begins to get more with it and demands that she empty out her bag; she hits the roof and storms out. Because of the excellent and open relationship she had developed prior to this tragedy he is the first to 'find' some real evidence in her bag; he then looks around the hose for her 'stash' - apparently his sensibility is from school lessons on drug taking - and when he discovers a large stash in the bathroom he flushes it! NOT A HAPPY WOMAN when she takes her next bath and its 'disappeared'. The kid keeps one back and places it on the meal table - she then goes into further denial - admits it and says its no worse than dope. Thge kid does all the right things and calls her friends and generally puts her in a position where she has to come 'clean' - if you'll pardon the pun. The movie takes the viewer through some pretty arduous situations where danger is not far away. Eventaully she gets help from a professional organisation and does cold turkey - you'll have to watch the film to see what happens next . . . . ,positive
 It's not like an historical movie it's not a movie with unforgettable love stories it's not a movie with a spectacular scenario but i can surely say it's a movie with a great atmosphere... It had that 60's kind of bohemian and rebellious spirit: a group of friends living in a poor apartment in Paris each one making art dreaming of changing the world doing drugs and loving in his very own way. It takes a lot of patience to watch and a special mood that if you're not in you might find it extremely boring and dull. I liked a lot the very realistic approach of the events that took place and their immediate effect on student's lives: the fear for their future the difficulty of earning their living the obstacles in following their dreams. What i absolutely loved was the black & white image. The still camera angles were amazing they were like freezing moments. It left me the impression of a long slide show of old and very emotive and suggestive photographs. I actually had to see the movie again just to take those amazing screen-shots. In one word: beautiful... ,positive
 Just as in Rififi the most compelling scene in the movie is the perfected silence of the jewel heist. The scene is masterful in its execution each of the robbers having their own specialized job to perform each one successfully combining their own unique talent towards the objective and each one until a month before complete strangers. Many of the scenes play out very slowly. In fact the opening scene is a long character introduction to both Corey and Vogel as we see Corey getting released from prison and Vogel escaping capture on his way to prison. The two characters are then methodically brought together through fate at a roadside diner as Vogel hides inside the trunk of Corey's automobile. From this improbable break in the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a perfected and precise jewel heist. However to pull of this heist they must include the help of a third man named Jansen. Jansen is hired as the sure shot gun man. His inclusion into the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. At the time of his hire Jansen is in a full battle with DT's and spent most of his day on his cot hallucinating over lizards snakes and spiders. His transition from the disheveled and hallucinatory world of a William S. Burroughs dream into the steady handed and sober sharp shooter is a very quick one and perhaps the only real false moment of the film but that's just me being extremely picky. One other mildly false note was that of the police inspector Mattei. At times he appeared to be brilliant in the ways of strong arming the right people or gathering information and waiting out for his escaped prisoner to make his move. Other times he appeared to be 10 years past retirement especially at the beginning during Vogel's escape through the woods. I wonder if I got too much hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie. At the start of the movie as the police car is speeding through the city the first image we see is that of a red stop light. My first thought was that this may be the 'red circle' and that if I am to find a deeper meaning in the movie perhaps it is that this car or rather the people inside of it going through the red light will be the ones who will 'stop' the jewel heist. Hmmmm? Perhaps the red circle refers to the triumvirate thieving ring? Perhaps it was the burning sled? No matter. It's a long movie but it doesn't feel that way. The ending is a bit of a disappointment. It seemed too hurried for a movie that felt like such a delicious slow burn. 9/10 Clark Richards ,positive
 Went to the Preview Engagement of Grand Champion today (Dallas/Fort Worth Austin Snyder and a couple of other Texas cities). There are so few movies suitable for young children...but this one is and it's great. Though the plot is a little Hokey (also the name of the steer in the movie) it is a wonderful story for children. And I enjoyed it too. The film pretty well represents West Texas ranch family life although a little exaggerated. Director/Author Barry Tubb ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment. He called the film his love letter to Texas. Joey Lauren Adams plays the single mom of Buddy (Jacob Fisher) and Sister 'Blow' (Emma Roberts). Watch Emma Roberts (Julia Roberts' niece); she's very good and I think she will be in more films. There are also cameo appearances from Julia Roberts Bruce Willis musicians George Strait Charlie Robison Robert Earl Keen Joe Ely and rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman. If you have young children or just want to see a feel-good movie check out Grand Champion when it comes to your city (supposedly later this month). Y'all will enjoy it and it WILL make you feel good. I guess since I'm from West Texas I might be a little biased...nah I'm impartial. The film is excellent! ,positive
 Anderson's animation easily rivals that of Pixar and goes well beyond most anything I've ever seen Disney do. While some say the story is a bit too abstract I find it a thought-provoking and refreshing change from the exaggerated characters and bumbling animals typically found in animated shorts. It's an interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left the safe harbor of home and gone off to a lonely frightening place by themselves will readily identify with this forlorn microbe. Excellent work Mr. Anderson! ,positive
 Working at a movie theater as a projectionist I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie . But of course I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. The story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. Of course I do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson Christina Ricci and yes even Justin Timberlake I encourage you to see 'Black Snake Moan'. ,positive
 I loved this film! It has a great heart and great bones. I stumbled onto it by chance and I had no recollection not even an inkling of this movie from promos or reviews or word of mouth.   I remember reading many years ago a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having them contaminated by the pre-judgement of reviews or the false shill of the promos.  And this seems to be the single most common source of the critics' negative reaction to the film:  it failed to meet expectations of it being a comedy or a slice of life or character driven.  I had no expectation about the film and so it was comedic - but I only laughed once or twice - without being a comedy; it was about a person but so eccentric that it wasn't slice of life; it was about a character but the character was so intelligently optimistic and trusting of her instinct to life that it wasn't the angst-driven sentimental melodrama so typical of American 'serious' film - as I wrote that I realized that writer/director Lisa Krueger managed to poke fun at this schlock American sentimentality in the husband!  And very cleverly too! And Kreuger was able to keep the cloyingly sentimental ending from the screen when the wayward  not prodigal husband returned with his tail shrunk between his legs. Bravo Ms. Krueger bravo!  (Now I will be watching this film again as it is getting better and better as I reflect on it.)    Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant. I loved how subtly but completely she was able to portray and convey intelligent awareness of her committable commitment to honouring her words and actions - she knew that in keeping her word with a band or friends or husband that she was setting herself up to ridicule and/or disappointment in a world that was unable to honour commitment as she was able to do. But even with that strength she was fully connected to humanity and embraced with a fully committed heart their frailty and failures. The character of Joline was amazingly well acted and I left the film surprised that I had no recollection of awards nominations for it. Okay not that surprised as American awards tend to go to women in 'serious' roles filled with angst and the proper amount of nudity which this film did not have. What it has was far better which was heart in this woman's discovery of herself with the assistance of new friends and a self-deprecating shaman. I admit to being a bit of a soft touch for eccentric characters who manage their peculiarities while remaining honest and true to themselves as they move through the minefield of what comprises 'proper' societal behaviour and 'acceptable' interpersonal discourse. So if people must conform to normality in your world then this film will not be to your liking.  And that was it seems one of the common threads in the critiques. And I am always a sucker for a good play on words when it raises questions of human behaviour and ethical/philosophical values. Until this movie I hadn't made the emotional connection between being committed (to a cause or honesty or something) and being committed (to an insane asylum). At what point does one's commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a one way ticket to insanity? This sounds like a simple question or one that is easily dismissed as being rhetorical. But is it? And yet few of the critics - I think maybe two commented on this aspect of the film either directly or indirectly. A lovely film. 8/10.   ,positive
 All credit to writer/director Gilles Mimouni who fashioned this winding twisting tale of deceit and betrayal. While keeping the utmost control he maintains the audience at arm's length never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on. Even his clever denouement has you guessing. The three central performances are also top class with Vincent Cassel Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role. To give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair. Thierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma and Cardine Biggerstaff's editing keeps the story a step ahead of us. The theme from Peter Chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script. Many may say Gilles Mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love. For me this is simply a haunting elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web. Only the French are capable of such tantalisation. Hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending. Monday March 2 1998 - Hoyts Croydon No-one does thriller quite like the French. When they get it right they really get it right. Vincent Cassell is intriguing as the deceptive Max Romane Bohringer obsessive as the new Lisa and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot from Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires. All credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot and the performances from the three leads. As Lucien Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. Friday January 15 1999 - Video ,positive
 This movie is based on the game series: Final Fantasy. This one particularly is about FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game and I was very happy to see it be transformed into a movie I loved the CG that was awesome. Lot's of great fight scenes action and characters to make the movie memorable. If your a die-hard fan of the game you will love this movie. Personally I'm not a die-hard fan of the games but I am starting to become one. My favourite character out of Final Fantasy VII besides Cloud would have to be Cid. I love Cid I think he's cute. I was amazed how real the CG images were it was amazing it's the game in 3D. I had a great time watching the movie and by the way I love the aeons to especially Bahamut he's great! Overall I gave this movie a 9 because yes I loved it. I thought it was a really really good movie and yes it's on my list of movies to get. The characters were amazing loved the CG story was wonderful with lot's of action and fight scenes. All-in-all it's the best movie I've seen yet based on a video game. ,positive
 I've often heard people express disappointment that Mazursky's Tempest has little to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion that is both true and false but most of all it's a bad starting point for offering critique. A work of art should never be criticised for what it isn't but for what it is. The movie Tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to Shakespeare's work in spirit. What Tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No not experimental as in hand- held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings. Mazursky's Tempest is epic sad realistic joyous full of life but most of all it is imaginative. Cassavetes portrayal of Philip/Prospero is in itself worth a 10/10 rating and when you add Gena Rowlands Susan Sarandon a wonderfully deep Molly Ringwald Raul Julia the dialogue the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture... I rest my case. One of the best movies of the 80's. Don't miss it. ,positive
 Out to Sea was a great movie. I expected comedy and from about 10 minutes into the film to the end there was comedy and laughing points. Jack and Walter are great together and the addition of Rue McClanahan made it a wonderful movie that should be seen over and over again. ,positive
 I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked him in his (title) role as a butcher boy. The way he moves is very funny in my opinion for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expressions really suit the role he plays for example how he winks at the audience in the end. But one might add that that was probably not too difficult. Anyway I think he would have deserved a longer career. As you probably know it was ruined by greedy journalists who made money by printing false accusations that said he was involved in a scandal. The plot is not very important. In the first half Fatty and Alum are employees at a store and rivals for Almondine's affection. After a heavy food fight Almondine is sent to a girls' school by her father the store owner. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fatty and Alum enter the school in drag and the fight for Almondine continues. (Some of the characters' names are different in the version that I have seen. It seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones.) There are a lot of corny gags like food fights and pratfalls but they are done well in my opinion. And there are some gags I really liked for example how they make the dog run the pepper mill (or is it a coffee mill?) or the scene when Fatty dons a coat although it is obviously not necessary or when Miss Teachem the head of the girls' school spanks Fatty and he spanks her back. Buster Keaton is also funny in this his first movie; a good addition to the cast. In the first half he is a customer at the store in the second half he supports Alum in his fight for Almondine. I liked his acrobatics for example when Fatty pushes him from one room of the school to another he doesn't show a simple pratfall but lands on his hands and his head and does a little pirouette. Watch out for one scene in the food fight: Alum throws a flour bag at him but it misses and hits the store owner instead. That makes Buster laugh which must be a rarity since he normally always shows a neutral expression (which - as you probably also know already - got him the nickname 'The Great Stone Face'). (One more note: Al St. John who plays Alum was 'Fatty' Arbuckle's nephew and later became famous for the role of 'Fuzzy' that he played in lots of westerns.) I don't like this one as much as I like for example 'One Week' and 'The Balloonatic' (films that Buster made later without 'Fatty'). And it didn't make me laugh out loud often - but it made me smile a lot so I have given it eight points. ,positive
 I consider this film to be a complete masterpiece - actually I consider it to be Fernando Fragata's best work and undoubtedly the best of all Portuguese movies. I don't think you can come across such a zero budget kind of film as impressive and astonishing as this one. The direction is done with perfection at an incredible fast pace and the music also composed by Fragata is mostly excellent. The story is creepy and humorous at the same time and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying Misery loves company kind of situations intertwined with a mind boggling mystery. A more than perfect recipe to glue the viewers' eyes to the screen from frame one to the last. It's been called Neo-Hitchcock and I'll agree. Much like the best Hitchcocks it kept me guessing during the entire film and most of my suppositions were far for what ends up being smartly revealed. ,positive
 I just saw Eagle´s wing . I do not really know why this movie was made. What is the message of this story? Nevertheless I liked it. There are some exciting scenes in it. I appreciate a strong performance by Martin Sheen. Harvey Keitel is less convincing. ,positive
 I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was. Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen. I have not seen Naach as yet but I am looking forward for it. I for some reason don't find Antra Maali that exciting to watch on the screen - unlike Urmila. ,positive
 Having worked professionally with young girls on the run I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape. There are classic themes here: Coming of Age Mother/Daughter Estrangement The Limited Choices of the Underprivileged Who is the Good Samaritan Tragedy is in Every Life & the many layers or relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it does not end in cliché. The cast really sells their roles. It is adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy. Allow it 15 minutes to so to draw you in. ,positive
 Quai des Orfevres takes too long getting going with Clouzot so enamored of his back-stage milieu that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story. However once it does it's Clouzot at his best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid) is the worldworn pianist who married beneath himself and who plans to kill the seedy studio mogul with designs on his wife only to find that someone has beaten him to it. Not only that but his carefully planned but clumsily executed alibi falls to pieces not least when a thief steals his car at the murder scene The film really kicks into life with the arrival of Luis Jouvet's police inspector a rather wonderful creation half Alistair Sim in Green for Danger and half world-weary Maigret with better dialog. In a neat running gag his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of his voice against chaos and noise whether it be the noisy typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal. The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation a wealth of chaotic and telling small details that makes Steve Bocchco's once revolutionary 80's US cop shows look like antiquated museum pieces by comparison. If Suzy Delair is a rather unconvincing femme fatale the supporting cast more than compensate with the beautiful Simone Renant a standout as the lesbian photographer in love with her from afar and constantly mistaken for Blier's lover by Delair and other interested parties (only Jouvet similarly unlucky with women understands and genuinely sympathises). With great black and white photography by Armand Thirard this is a terrific little thriller with a nice twist ending and a lovely scene with a cab driver reluctantly identifying Renant in a police station. (Trivia note: Pierre Larquey who played the playfully philosophical Dr Vorzet in Le Corbeau turns up in smaller roles as a cab-driver in both Quai and Les Espions.) The Criterion DVD is quite superb - great picture quality plus an illuminating extract from a French TV show featuring interviews with Clouzot Blier and Renant. ,positive
 A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However JBD delivers considerably more. Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however) the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil. Oh yeah- George Kennedy is here too and when is that not a good thing? If you liked Wrong Turn then watch this to see where much of its' methodology came from. ,positive
 If you think about it it's nearly unbelievable that a film could be made about the death penalty (one of the world's most controversial topics) that offends neither those for nor against. It's a testament to Tim Robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity traits that can be seen in his acting roles as well (Shawshank Redemption Jacob's Ladder). This film in fact hints at a subtle compromise between the for and against camps... so subtle that it can't be put into words subtle to the point of vanishing yet one gets the sense after watching the picture that a compromise is possible that somehow it can be worked out if only we look deeply enough... ,positive
 I cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than par but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. Alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself where I have I seen them before? Forget the running time listed on New Line's tape this ain't no 103 minutes according to my VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8. ,positive
 I first saw this film when I was about 6 ish - my grandma thought it'd be a nice kiddies film to entertain me and keep me occupied....however every time I watched it I had nightmares the same night. Yes it masquerades as a kids' film but even now I find it really dark in places particularly the haunting music that is played each time the guardian angel woman is on the screen and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice. The actual baddies of the film ie the sharks Mr Grimes etc didn't scare me at all I just always found the whole film rather creepy and dark. This is obviously something I can appreciate now that I'm 21 years old but speaking from experience there is no way I would show it to my kids! ,positive
 When one thinks of Soviet cinema the propaganda masterpieces of Eisenstein or the somber meditations of Tarkovsky generally come to mind. They're great films sure but generally not the most entertaining material out there. However the countries within the Iron Curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states had. In fact from the 1930s up until the 70s forty of these song-and-dance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public. However they are completely unheard of in the West so this documentary attempts to rectify that situation. It does a terrific job of both showcasing these films and putting them into the proper cultural context. Despite the fact I've never been a fan of musicals I found this documentary to be completely compelling from beginning to end. It goes to prove that no matter how many films you manage to see in your lifetime you're only skimming the surface of whats out there. As for the film clips themselves they're very entertaining. While some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much they love working under the regime some of the films (particularly the later ones) look quite accomplished from a production standpoint. Plus they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes. There's a few similarities between them and the American musicals I'm used to but the presence of strict government enforcing of a message gives them a surreal edge. They certainly don't resemble the musicals made in the West. This documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films I've seen in recent memory and its an absolute must-see for any film buff. (9/10) ,positive
 SPOILERS As you may know I have been commenting on a lot of silent short films in the past months. Now I have no idea why I am commenting on Steamboat Willie I guess I was just desperate to comment on anything so I watched this and now I am commenting on it. This or course is one of the very first cartoons and I believe it is not the first cartoon with sound. Here is the plot. Mickey Mouse is driving a steamboat when Pete throws him off and he drives it. When they stop for cargo Minnie Mouse tried to get on but failed miserably. Mickey gets her up by a crane. Then a goat eats her sheet of paper with Turkey in the Straw on it. They use the goat to make the song. When I say that I mean that they used the goat as a Victrola. Mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for instruments to the song. Then an angry Pete throws Mickey in a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day. Overall this is yet another groundbreaking silent short film. I mean this is the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. Yes the third. Also this is not the first cartoon with sound. I believe there were two more before this one. Either way this film is really really groundbreaking. Mikcey was also more violent than he is mow. I mean he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it. 9/10 Recommended Films: Plane Crazy. ,positive
 First let's call this movie what it is: 1. It's a feel-good movie with a message. 2. The acting is just okay dialog slightly better production value pretty good. 3. Rugby scenes...just barely passable. But here's the trick: this isn't something Hollywood contrived and it isn't trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport. It is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people in real circumstances and a real storyline. Sure they could have done a better job actually rep'ing the sport but my vote: it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do. (And fwiw I can't think of many football baseball hockey or soccer movies that are true to the sport either. C'mon...Bull Durham?) I'm not a rugby player (I was a wrestler) but I graduated from Highland attended '86-'90 and occasionally trained with the Rugby guys. My brother-in-law David however was one of the original founding members of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother Billy played the next year as I recall. If you're interested there's a Highland Rugby site at highlandrugby.net that addresses the history of the team.) By the time I was there the club had been in existence for about a decade and had long since built a reputation for excellence. It's a fact that they focused on broad training topics: devotion honor discipline effort not tactics. I thought the rugby guys I knew were a little 'off' in the head but I think I might have just been a little jealous. They were hard-core dedicated to the belief system that Gelwix promoted. With regard to the cultural mixing issues that have been brought up it might be interesting to note that while I was there in the 80's one of the larger schools in the city was shut down - South High School - and its students distributed among the other 3 primary SLC schools. To be honest Highland pre-80's was pretty whitebread...I've got a picture of the team from (I think) 1977 that shows an *all* white club. South High on the other hand was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: I had a pair of friends from South who joined the team one Tongan one Samoan and as I recall there were a bunch of Island-nation players that joined up '88-'90. I don't think anyone questioned the credibility of the team in adopting Maori (or other cultural) traditions: if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys it's that they walked the walk. And as to the strength of the team when compared to the best highschool-age teams in the world: yeah it's true that US-Rugby on average when taken as a whole does not represent particularly well against the best elsewhere. There are exceptions but hey - it's a simple fact that Rugby doesn't have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the US that arise in other countries. With that said judge Highland on its merits: - the *only* team to qualify for the USA Rugby National Championships every year of that organizations' 25-yr history. - a win record of 392 wins 9 losses. Read that again...winningest coach in any US sport in history. - regular international tours. - some compelling wins against some legitimate international teams. Are they the world best? Maybe some years probably not most...but they're pretty good on a consistent basis. And it's disrespectful to the game to blow them off when Highland Rugby may be the best ambassador to the sport in the US. ,positive
 This game is one of the best horror/shooter games I've ever played. The plot is a little choppy but the game never fails to send you plenty of chills and excitement. Many people shelved the game when they found that there are no cheat codes for it and very little health potions and ammo to be found. But actually after you've gone through the game once you are more familiar with the monsters and different rooms so you can easily get by the second time around. The puzzles are great not too hard not too easy. There are tons of different monsters so you never get bored. And there are plenty of gaming areas. You really feel like you're in a good Stephen King novel as you play. It's nice and creepy. Pick this game up cheap and have some fun. ,positive
 Hey now I have never laid eyes on a Manga comic but apparently this movie is based on one. Ah well such is life. Anyway this is a pretty bizarre to say the least movie as things literally spiral out of control in a small Japanese town. People are becoming obsessed with the uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl watches her friend's father videotape a snail and later in the movie people start becoming snails? It also seems this boy's dad becomes so obsessed he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance. There is some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a Tim Burton movie but there is some nastiness & gore like only the Japanese can do with justice. As with a lot of Japanese films though the ending is the ending and did anything get resolved? Well not to my mind it didn't. There are some hints as to why this is all happening but they aren't explored and there's a lot left to either the imagination or else it wasn't deemed important. Still though there are lots of things for the eye to feast on and if you aren't obsessed with everything making perfect sense this is well worth seeing because it's just so original and bizarre. My favorite was the father with the spinning eyeballs personally. 8 out of 10 stars. ,positive
 Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for unknown to the owner he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian in part because Norton's beautiful daughter Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her. However Brian does come up with a great security device. It's called CHOMPS which stands for canine home security system. The device which looks like a dog is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture burglars. The rival owner sends two bungling spies (one is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton security? This is a fun family flick from the old school of good clean entertainment. CHOMPS is of course a real dog played by the adorable and talented Benji. In fact Benji has a duel role as Brian has a real dog named Rascal too. Just watching this little dog in action is pure joy as he is able to scale walls pull trucks and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys. The human cast is also quite nice with everyone giving upbeat performances that are infectious. Costumes scenery and production values are good too. Although you may have trouble locating the film it would be well worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful wholesome diversion from the world's woes. ,positive
 Take a young liberal idealist Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton) put in a top secret classification in a government front company because of his father's position team him up with a no'count drug dealer Daulton Lee (Sean Penn) who is wanted by the police and needs a new source of income and you have a recipe for espionage. Sean Penn played the part of the punk drug dealer with a certain sang froid probably out of particular verisimilitude with such raunchy types. The gall Penn carries with him in every situation is unique; he even suggests the Soviets run drugs for him. I've seen the movie over and over again and each time I see something new. It seems to me that a major problem with US spy organizations is its inbreeding which leads to the hiring of an obviously unsuitable candidate by reason of temperament and inclination for a government front company. I do recall when the Falconeer escaped from prison and led the authorities on a wild goose chase. I see that despite the escape he is now released. A pity the Soviets are no longer around to accept the wretch! A Cheery Cherio! ,positive
 I am surprised that there is confusion over the title of this film. Quite obviously it is an investigation into the nature of modern love. It is suggesting that love is love while the going is good but one in which people reserve the right to put themselves first and if the going gets tough they get out and go onto something else. This observation has generational implications as it is coming from Generation X makes comment on Generation X and in the end is aimed at Generation X. It expresses disappointment that love has transformed from that which the Baby Boomers the parents of Generation X had engendered in their marriages and family lives and which gave Generation X the innocent and bountiful childhood it ultimately enjoyed. The Generation X attitude to love is of course flippant but as decisions are made and commitments are broken the biggest casualty are the children of Generation X. This is made clear at the end of the film and was so pungent I took a week to recover from the shock I received from this epiphany. ,positive
 This is the funniest sequel I have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary. It has some very gory pieces in the film but not bad enough to make you sick. In this one he has a female doll companion hence the name. If you liked the first three then you'll love this go watch it! ,positive
 Lang does Hawks as well as Hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary Western before settling down into typical deterministic dark and guilt-haunted Lang for the finale. This is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and being pursued we know not why -- he stumbles on wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse but discovering that Creighton is in a bad way decides to fix him up first. This is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief clipped dialog - in 2 minutes we know that Shaw is an outlaw but basically a good guy. Shaw ends up helping Creighton on his way to civilization then disappears. Cut to a few weeks or months later with Creighton on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from Omaha. He hires Shaw as a scout who tries to leave when he finds out that Creighton is in charge; but Creighton wants him anyway repaying a debt and sensing something quality. Also hired is a tenderfoot son of a benefactor of the project but atypically the Easterner Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting bronco-busting sequence. Both of the hires vie for Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore) who - again not typically - seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man. The camaraderie between the three men the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of Howard Hawks' Red River or Only Angels Have Wings than most Lang - but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter and doesn't alter our pleasure - if it does perhaps change our expectations - as the more usual Langian themes of the haunted past dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film. Shaw's old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move westward; attacks mount on the crew and Shaw has to wrestle with what if anything he is to tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) leader of the outlaws. Beautifully shot in early Technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations this is for my money easily Lang's best western and one of his very best films conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future. Scott is as good as I've seen him showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine. The inevitable showdown between Shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary and a surprise even for a longtime Lang devotee such as myself; and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside. You can get a shave you can feel like a new man but you can't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back. Genius. ,positive
 With Batman Returns Tim Burton succumbed to an important priority in American cinema: giving a sequel to a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful movie of the year Batman (1989) here comes the hero of Gotham City again for the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor Batman Returns enjoyed an enormous commercial success. Tim Burton made Batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the Joker did little to improve the image of Gotham City. Indeed violence and corruption still exist and here the second word is epitomized by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two crooks who are eager to take control of Gotham City are going to make life difficult for Batman. His task will be more difficult with the apparition of Catwoman... Tim Burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie. It means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first Batman. But he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that. If in the movie of 1989 Burton had focused on Bruce Wayne/Batman's psychology here it's the penguin that obviously interested him. The director attempted to make of him very well acted by De Vito an ambiguous character. On one hand he's full of bad intentions (previously quoted) but on the other hand he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man. Batman Returns also appears as crazier than its predecessor especially with the cast. I think of Michèle Pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as Catwoman. Besides at the time when I'm writing this review it makes me remember that a new version of Catwoman is currently at the cinema. But given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!) it is sure that her performer Halle Berry must pale into insignificance beside Pfeiffer. Ultimately this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it enables to develop Tim Burton's peculiar style. We also still find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. Concerning Batman's other adaptations for the screen you can skip them. Batman Forever (1995) and Batman and Robin (1997) are no good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was shooting the beginning of the Batman story and it was to be released next year. Will it match Tim Burton's works? ,positive
 I was shocked at how good this German version of films such as Scream was. Surpassing all the modern American efforts at slasher films. It as what all those films don't. Likable characters genuine mystery suspense graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack. This stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out in years. German cinema is going from strength to strength just lately. Its a shame more people wont go to see such films because they are missing out. It is easily available on DVD so even if you hate subtitles I think you should see it. It will be one of the best horror films you will see all year. ,positive
 Where to begin where to begin . . ?(Savannah in the episode Gimme Shelter ) To disabuse: Fox/Viacom does not at this point in time have any intention of releasing THE show on DVD. But be not downhearted! That you are reading this reveals that the magic lingers fifteen years on . . . And small wonder. This was post-modern television a valiant attempt to visualize magical realism. 'neath the blue patina charm and brio were scripts bursting with symbolism and metaphor music that actually interacted with scenes! And ultimately an attempt however doomed to recapture one's belief in innocence to reclaim Eden as it were . . . It's potency is perhaps best attested to by the fact that even as we umm type a book is being written about the show wherein will be found the thoughts fancies and reminiscences of many of the show's actors writers directors and producers. In the meanwhiles . . . anyone desirous of once again visiting the end of the world and reacquainting themselves with Seamus Sheriff Cody Savannah et al . . . should not hesitate to contact me I may be able to make you a copy.

 Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion respectfully. The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War Two and particularly naval warfare I favor depictions of subs and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of things. For those unacquainted with target priorities an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing Rank and British-Gaumont studios back in the day: frankly I prefer its quieter more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced Hollywood movie ever could. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger's The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman a favorite of mine. John Mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles so this is clearly meant to be Mr. Portman's film but the whole cast shines. As for the title sequence am I the only one who is utterly charmed by Gainsborough Production's lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl? ,positive
 Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August a single mother who's the working definition of the word dreamer and her solemn pragmatic daughter. Adele wanting to make a fresh start in a big city moves them from Wisconsin to California. Decent if not exceptional or particularly memorable with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons that's for sure. Best thing it offers is a solid cast and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times. Could be better could be worse. I gave this one seven out of ten. ,positive
 Sally and Saint Anne is a very funny movie. The first time my Mom told me about it I was 7 and Saint Anne had just been the Saint I had for my Communion Saint. My Mom knew this so she told me to watch this with her. I did and have seen it many times since because it is really funny. Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show was in it and Sally's grandfather was the guy who played Santa Claus in Miracle On 34th Street. So there were lots of actors we seen on TV shows too. There is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away and Sally keeps trying things with St. Anne to help raise money so they can keep the house. That includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian who plays her older brother. This is a good and funny movie that I still love. ,positive
 ...Our the grandpa's hour. More than the gangsters it's a detailed depiction of an American family circa 1930:the father proud of his job who worries about his son who's given up high school the mum everyone would like to have the daughter who forgets dinner time in his squeeze's arms and the twins who are absolutely lovable ( Don't go to sleep first please! ). And there's the grandfather playing the Yankee doodle on his flute .Have you noticed that this tune plays the same role as Doris Day's Que Sera Sera in Hitchcock's The man who knew too much (1956)?And there's this grandpa who is finally the most courageous person of the family .So old he does not even tell you his age but proud of his country and resisting to the gangster's hateful blackmail. A good film by Wellman. ,positive
 I remember watching this series avidly and being so disappointed when it came to an end. Over the years since then I have tried to find out if I could obtain a copy of it on either video or d.v.d. to no avail. However I was delighted to find this website with details of it only to be disappointed again at the point of purchase that the videos available will not play on English recorders! This production was so wonderful being absolutely accurate with Nevil Shute's novel taking the storyline through after the end of the war with Joe and Jean's subsequent life together - absolutely marvellous - and I just wish I were able to see it again as since it's original screening there have been no repeats of it on British television. ,positive
 Gilles Mamouni is playing with the audience with the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his biggest lost love (Monica Bellucci) just before to get engaged to another woman. Mamouni uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor's haircut. Oherwise it can get very confusing... Still a strong film debut for Mamouni beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (the 5th element the Messenger) and Monica Bellucci is a darling to watch ... I felt a little disappointed near the end so I gave it 9 out of 10. ,positive
 Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. It wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting whitey with his army of hot kung-fu mama's. It was a guilty pleasure great fun and best to watch it with friends. (10 out of 10) ,positive
 Alice enters in a world of wonder... but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid. The Mad Hatter the White Rabbit the Queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body -- and other people's bodies -- that might be quite wonderful. A tale of love and lust the likes you've never seen. Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say by 1970s standards this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day. I believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen (my love for all things Alice is no secret). Even better than Fairy Tales (which isn't really pornography so much). The songs are cheesy but fit the theme of the movie. One song What's a Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This? was pretty funny and the others had similar themes going. The trial towards the end was well scripted and fit very nicely into the world of Alice. The logic and humor were definitely accounted for. What more can you say about a film like this? All I know is for people who are used to adult films where it's just a 30-second lead-in to the sex this one is going to overload you with plot and music. But personally I think there's something very special about this film and I hope it gets a nice DVD release with things touched up and special features (if that's even possible). I can see this being a cult film. ,positive
 A delightful and wonderful film which has entered my pantheon of great romantic comedies. IN many ways it's even better than When Harry met Sally. IT wears well on viewing and re-viewing. The cast is excellent and both David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give us really believable characters. ,positive
 The Best of Everything is a high gloss large screen soap opera which follows the careers of four career women Hope Lange Suzy Parker Diane Baker and Martha Hyer at a New York publishing firm. What's the best for some women is not necessarily the best for all. Presiding over this group of young fillies is wise old mare Joan Crawford who's been around the track a few times on screen and in real life. She looks right at home as the boss lady as well she should have at this point. Around the time she was making The Best of Everything Joan Crawford became a widow when her fourth husband Alfred Steele died. It was a particularly traumatic event for her she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her. She inherited all of his stock in Pepsi Cola where he was the board chairman and during the same period as The Best of Everything was being made she wound up the queen bee at Pepsi Cola. Life does sometimes imitate art. So that authority as she barks out dictation and coffee orders to Hope Lange rings real true. In fact all the women here with the exception of Lange are in for some rough sledding. It's rough for Lange too but she literally makes the best of everything. What a collection of stinkers the men are in this film. The best of them Stephen Boyd is a heavy drinker. The others Louis Jourdan Robert Evans and Brett Halsey are as slimy a collection of rodents as ever gathered for one film. I can't forget Brian Aherne either who's the fanny pinching head of this publishing firm. Half that office would have sexual harassment suits going today. Some nice location shots of New York in the fifties make the film a real treat. Catch it by all means. ,positive
 Every review I have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken. So listen again and note the difference. The play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received polite well- enunciated English. I am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in Leicester unknowingly asked me age 14 to read a piece of Walter Scott which was written in the tone of the Border. I come from the Border and when I read it as it should be read it made all the difference. ,positive
 This is exactly what Australian Television and Australian Politics needs people with a sense of humour!!! Good on ABC for supporting these guys. The show is based around a couple of Aussie blokes who know how to take the mickey out of politicians or other people in the limelight. The boys use Sydney as their main base for making a splash in the public. Keep an eye out for the Crazy Wharehouse Guy or Mr Ten Questions. The guys who perform these acts are the same guys that presented CNNN. If you enjoyed CNNNN and the Glasshouse then you will love this show. I am still interested in knowing which stunts are real and which are purely acting because there are some questionable actions made by the guys... ,positive
 Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him all the while trying to understand Prot and find out if he is really from K-PAX. This movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre. One big part of K-PAX is drama/ science-fiction another part fantasy plus add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what K-PAX is all about. The story (as you see above) isn't too complicated or deep but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me. No special effects or graphics accompany this movie and there's no need to have them the music in the film is great however. A techno soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes K-PAX sound sci-fi and makes certain scenes intriguing. Kevin Spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien (Prot) from the planet K-PAX emotional with great facial expressions Spacey does a fine job in the lead role. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell that aids and attempts to understand Prot. Bridges is also excellent in his part. Bridges and Spacey fit together very well and they should after all they've both had a lot of experience. The wife of Dr. Powell is Rachel Powell played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays her part well showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient. Alfe Woodard plays Dr. Powell's coworker Claudia Villars we don't really see Claudia too much but overall she puts in an alright performance. K-PAX is rated PG-13 for a sequence of violent images and brief language and sensuality and that covers it. As far as violent images go we don't see too much. A few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but that's all. Language is as follows: 1 f word (wow only one!) 11 s words and a few uses of the Lord's name in vain. Not too bad really. The sensuality part is just from when Prot explains to Dr. Powell how reproduction works on K-PAX nothing terrible just something about it feels like having your nuts in a vice. Not too bad on the content level for a PG-13 movie it could have been a lot worse. In conclusion K-PAX is not a bad movie. It won't stun you but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch. It has some funny parts sad parts really sad parts and well you know what I mean. It's a story of a mental hospital patient what do you expect? All in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to K-PAX is a well done movie. Bonus! If you've seen this movie already like it and are thinking about getting the DVD I would highly recommend it. It has loads of extras to look through and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes. 8/10 ,positive
 I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of let's say Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit. So I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice. He did Buddy proud as were the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played Holly's backup group The Crickets. Music-wise there are some of Holly's better-known songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa in their last concert ever. Busey not only sings like Holly he's a dead ringer for him in the looks department. Some thing was the actor''s best performance ever and you get no argument from me. I'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that Iowa concert instead of dwelling on his tragic accident. The ending could have been a real downer but they didn't let it be. ,positive
 I really don't have any complaints about this movie except for the disturbing scenes with the body. I fell upon it while switching around the tv one night. The acting was actually amazing I didn't expect it to be better than it appeared! I thought Keanu's(who looks the SAME since 1986 which is a very good thing hehe) acting was really *great* and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! Its a fresh awaking of reality to the '80s compared to the other teen movies done by the brat pack(even though I do like those moives alot too). All in all I give it thumbs up! ,positive
 I like this movie. I may be biased because I love dolphins. However my 3 and 4 yr. old will sit and watch the whole movie.... It's not Oscar material but definitely entertaining. The dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper flips the pop can out of the water striking Sandy in the head. It's an endearing funny moment that makes me laugh every time. On the other hand the villainous banterings of the bully boatman (forget his name) are a little hard to take. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: do dolphins really make that much noise? Or is there some serious dubbing happening here? Bottom line: my kids like it and it keeps recycling through our VCR. ,positive
 I've been a fan of Larry King's show for awhile I think he does a terrific job overall and I don't think he ever 'wusses' out as so many people seem to believe. He's a subtle Scorpio he gets his zings in when he needs to just as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton during her first post-jail TV interview. The thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that Hilton is still apparently clueless about why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was a too-harsh sentence (and what's more actually MADE her serve it) . In all the time she was in jail supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell she never once in her mind rewound the events which led to her being given the sentence that Judge Sauer saw fit to impose on her. She never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she (1) showed up late in court for the original hearing and (2) proceeded to inform him when he asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended did she not get the papers in the mail that I have people who read that sort of thing for me. All the time she was in her cell she never came to the realization that this action (showing up late) and that statement -- and more importantly the attitude - the utter cavalier disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular that she displayed -- just might have made Judge Sauer (pardon the pun) go sour on her. Last night on King's show after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience how she has learned her lesson she answered his question Do you think you got a raw deal? with a resounding yes. And during the course of the conversation (if you can call it that) she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her. King asked gently more than once if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she finds herself in to which she pretty much stared at him blankly. She basically therefore holds the conscious belief that she's been victimized in this situation; she does not understand how she herself caused it that day in court by her cavalier attitude with the judge. I feel this is very sad - tragic even considering what a huge role model Hilton is to some people and it renders anything she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state into the realms of complete and utter cluelessness contradiction and hypocrisy. During the course of the interview Hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the Bible. At the end of the interview King scored major points by asking her what her favorite Bible passage was. She responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes (completely superficial non-insights which she had read on air as if she were Nelson Mandella or something) and finally grunting out I don't have a favorite passage. Judge Sauer in my book is a hero and after last night so is Larry King for subtly exposing Hilton for what she truly is. ,positive

 Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion this is by far the best film of the series and my favorite movie ever. This movie doesn't take itself seriously because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary that was necessary was put across in the first film. Golan and Globus made this film for Bronson fans not for the critics and it works. DW3 has been unfairly criticized as trash and a weary entry in a worn out series. These statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement but it wasn't. If you take it as what it is DW3 is just a fun action packed romp with Charlie doing to street punks what we all wish we could do. The action is non stop the atmosphere is great and the movie is just out and out the best Bronson flick ever made. You can tell that the penny pinching Cannon group spent a lot of money on this one. It is believed that Bronson thought this film was too violent and that was the reason why Winner didn't direct any of the following entries. I can understand his concern but as is always the case of sequels you have to push the envelope even further to pass a previous entry. In any case this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time. What makes DW3 the best of the series and my favorite film ever (not the best just my favorite) is the action Charlie's presence memorable villains and it's ability to get the viewers to jump on the bandwagon. The first film may be the most technically well made but this one is the most fun. For once Charlie actually has some clever lines (although he doesn't say much)and a halfway interesting story photography action and direction to back him up. Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one. Yes it's exploitive maybe it does promote stereotypes and maybe it is the same story as before but Bronson's films always have and always will stand for defending the common man and giving his audience what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates its' audience my reply is that the movies don't manipulate us the fans are the ones in charge. We demand that Bronson blow away deserving scum and in turn Winner and Co. deliver the goods. And for those of you who still want to put it down remember a few things. DW3 was the #1 movie in America when it came out and was among the viewing favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all films have to be epics they just have to be fun. **********/10 You can't get any better.

 This film is one of those that can't be regarded by its outwardness. Indeed at a first sight it seems that the story simply focus the desire of have more money. But..let's take a look on the other side...What do you see? You see that the money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings the human being have:Should I do the right thing or should't I? And... what's the right thing ? Le's make a deeper analyses... -What does it mean a little town in the border? - It means that sometimes we can go too close to the border of doing something we thought we couldn't... - What does it mean the arid soil shown in this picture? - It means the dryness that sometimes take possession ot our offensed hearts... - What does it mean the phrase of the character (KRISTEN) : Now I belong to him ? - It means the loss of our free will due to our unpremeditated deeds. In MY OPINION that's the writer of the story and the director tried to tell us. By the way...do you remember what another character (JACK BARNES)said: Nothing is so simple...  ,positive
 What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No a very fine effort that is amusing tuneful and just sexy enough. Fine performances particularly the Kristine DeBell in the lead and was that an unaccredited Richard Prior as the prone Knight being vigorously (if discreetly) ridden? ,positive
 Chips is an excellent blend of music light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance by Peter O' Toole and and effortless romantic supporting performance by Petula Clark. O' Toole is able to show the shy uncommunicative teacher that wishes so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married Katherine (Clark). She brings him the world What a lot of flowers and he is forever changed. He becomes the beloved headmaster of Brookfield through tragedy but knows he could only have achieved his goal through Katherine's love. The songs (with the exception of the Music hall number) are all thought-songs coming from character's emotions and thoughts and the more you listen to them the more beautiful they become - Walk through the World with Me and You and I . O'Toole's finest moment is the final speech he gives to the students (it was the reason for the Oscar nomination). As a teacher we question what book learning ever gets through - but as Chips says we did teach them how to behave with each other and that is what really counts. Beautifully filmed perfectly orchestrated by John Williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you. Did I Fill the World with Love? the boys sing their school song. By the end Chips realizes he was able to do it - but only cause Catherine was there. ,positive
 I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas Classic it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time her boss Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about. The only problem is : She hasn't got any farm and she can't cook. To get out of the jam Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner who has a farm) and flies for Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix. There's a fine direction by Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful : Stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman. Greenstreet Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters. The only weak point is the leading man Dennis Morgan. He starts well but as the movie goes on becomes really a bore. One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to ends up with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven who both would have been more suitable for the part. Anyway this is a joyful Christmas time movie with a refreshing score and I advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet Holidays...in Connecticut. ,positive
 My friend took me to a screening of this movie in Hollywood and it was awesome! It's a film noir with amazing acting great script cool music the whole thing was very well done and entertaining. Don't know if it is getting a release in theaters but this would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at Blockbuster. This is the kind of movie I love low on budget but big on style and imagination. I hope Alexandra Holden gets more big parts like she has in this one she is fantastic. ,positive
 There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons. They make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire. The main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire. Some would call that too sad and/or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick. I call it honesty. Most action movies tend to lean toward the safe side of showing violence and plot elements. This mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die. The violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying. A bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd. Renny Harlin showed a hint of this in his first (and sadly only) hit Die Hard 2. The villains intentionally crash a plane full of people to get their point across. The scene was also filmed with a backup scene of a cargo plane with only a few people on-board going down but the grimmer and probably more realistic scenario ended up being used. However to fit the spirit of the first film Die Hard 2 was mostly a fun action movie. Here that grimmer and more convincing edge is pervasive. The violence is bloody. The one liners are hilarious but with a certain style that more echoes natural human sarcasm than clichéd film wisecracks at key moments of action. The plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films. The villain is not just some rogue out for revenge or a mad grab at power. It is less ridiculous but also more frightening than that. From recent films the Bourne trilogy almost gets there with its less cheesy than usual action film style but this film is from 1996 and 7 years before The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon made it to the big screen. Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine. And this is well before the movie version of Tomb Raider became a hit. What's more is that this heroine genuinely looks like she could take down John McClane and then take his still lit cigarette. This movie marks Geena Davis's second action-heroine role and she still didn't manage to score a hit. While Angelina Jolie stars in Tomb Raider years later and scores a hit. The reasons are beyond me. Completely. Lastly this movie isn't all dark edged. There are many outrageous and spectacular set pieces that one can only see in an action film. The climatic explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of movie pyrotechnics with more than one law of physics taking a convenient break. Thus there is formula here but it is the Anti-Formula for the everyday Hollywood Action Movie Formula. --- 9/10 BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence profanity ,positive
 Brilliant work. Marvelous actors dissolve as brave and courageous characters .All unforgettable parts in a more than intriguing and capturing action thriller. The casting is perfect. Both from the side of the stars like :Armand Asante Bernhardt Kier Denier. But as well for new faces .I was very impressed by the young actor who plays the boy gang member- Mustafa. You trust each one from the Turkish gang. Very convincing is Michael Barral and all white power followers. I admire the music beat of the main theme of Children of Wax .This sound track is a charming mixture of Turkish hard rock and Udo Kier's humming And in the same time Children of Wax a tale focusing on racial conflicts .The intolerance and brutality between the skinheads and the Turks. ,positive
 Claudine is a movie that is representation of the american system at it's worst. The welfare system was initially set up as a stepping stone for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet.The movie showed an accurate portrayal of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit. In other words if the father or any male figure is in the lives of the women and children their financial support from the system would be jeopardized if not terminated. The struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world. I would like to see a reproduction of this movie back in the stores for all to rent or buy for their library collection. ,positive
 The story of dirty fat filth-like middle-age woman who lives out of society be knowing as the filthiest woman ever lived. Can someone take her the crown? There is one couple .....

 Mr Bean was great fun i loved it every episode was really funny Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious!!! The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997 which was also pretty funny by the way!! It's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into this series was a classic for sure and i still watch an episode from time to time. Mr Bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book fans of offbeat comedy must check this out. ,positive
 I caught this filmshow about the most unlikely success? from a lower league football team. The plot is thick and roles out some great tenuous twists and turns. Intercut with shots and commentary from the 70's .I was taken aback by its shear footy fun. A great cast includes the excellent Tim Healy as the crazed(drunk) manager bumbling along hanging on to anything that will make his team win...? I keep remembering bits such as the stolen secret file that Don Revie( Super leeds united and england manager-loved by the fans hated by everyone else)has on Bostock United ( the underfelt men) which in its detailed report of their opposition Bostock United in this the FA Cup final merely says Sh-te . Lots of other footy gags a long time before the fantastic feature length Mike Basset - Football Manager Starring Ricky Tomlinson. Up there with the Gung ho English beating Germans at football. Well morally.Although the score lines says different of Escape to Victory ( I still cheer when England score ) And the thankless eternal grind of following a really bad team in Micheal Palins Golden Gordon from Ripping Yarns series ( with Terry Jones)the team were called Bostonworth United in case your interested. I've looked high and low for a copy of Bostock's Cup-even Nick Hancock's biography doesn't list it ( probably someone -not mr hancocks- error) Play it again or sell me a copy- PLEASE.... ,positive
 Through the years I've been very much interested in the life of this teenager who left such a profound indelible mark on the world. My fascination has also been born of fear as in could this happen again. And throughout the ensuing years yes I fear 'it' continues to happen around us and of course 'it' was happening long before Anne. The 'it' of course is can a so-called civilized society turn on its own or on an innocent country/race/continent and murder citizens in cold blood on the flimsiest of excuses? I leave that question out there. At the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader Adolf Hitler in that the one profound fact about Hitler that is never mentioned was that he was elected democratically and all of the atrocities committed were done as the result of a compliant poodle-press and fear-mongering propaganda played over and over again for a docile population. One of the atrocities was Anne Frank who put a face to the death camps by the miracle of her diary's survival. Kenneth Brannagh does a wonderful job on the commentary and interviewing he has that rare gift of minimizing his own persona thus allowing the subjects to speak for themselves. Many new facts and people never before interviewed are brought to life in the meticulous research which I will not go into here as they add immeasurably to the reality and gut wrenching sorrow of the film. Glenn Close reads selections from the diary and her voice is perfect for the part she brings a naiveté and freshness to the role. Old childhood friends of Anne's are interviewed at length and her last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant and mischievous personality. This is not to be missed. A wonderful and respectful film about the seldom seen Anne. 10 out of 10. ,positive
 As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now and I would have to say this was his best pre-zombie offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died I guess it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch? Is it a young woman that lives in a fancy modern house on the outskirts of town who used to do a lot of drugs? Is it the village idiot who gets nabbed early on because of being in the wrong place at the wrong time? You'll only know if you watch and watch you should for this is a top-notch mystery thriller or should I say a giallo . I've seen this before but it's been a long time and upon a second viewing it was still as powerful as the first time. For those of you that only know Lucio Fulci for his zombie flicks well open your minds to this because it's well worth seeing and while the monsters in this are human they're as nasty as anything dredged up in his later films. 9 out of 10 stars see it! Please.... ,positive
 Dr. Bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it. The thing about him is that he is depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife separated his children are deviant he cannot perform in the bedroom and he feels as if he isn't doing a very good job at healing people. He becomes suicidal but meets Barbara who changes his ideas for the better. All around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside. The movie is well done and the character of Dr. Bock is well played out. It's a little sad somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama. It was good to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what Dr. Bock was doing. Great movie. ,positive
 I was amazed about this early performance of Clint Eastwood. I had not read a summary of the film when I decided to watch it on TV. Due to Mr. Eastwood I expected some nice shootings and no deep story. I was quite mistaken. I found a couple of topics unusually explicitly addressed and until the end I couldn't make up my mind about who's good and who's bad. This movie is definitely not typical Eastwood but surely worth watching. ,positive
 Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas Phoenix Fresno etc. just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years.... But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army? That based on the hammer and sickle could only have been the People's Revolutionary Army of Mao Tse Dung!!! Never mind the undies and the unwed twosome in bed -- would that logo and that reference have survived during the Cold War? Additional observation 12/27: This film of the 30's with the soviet emblem may/must also reflect the influence on and charm of communism in Hollywood and much of America during the Depression. Adds to the historical value of this terrific film. Also I liked the American Dream aspects of two guys from Winnemucca taking at least part of the world by storm Red-Blooded (literally and copiously in Jim's case)American Boys. Others have commented more ably than I on the aerobatics etc. I loved it all. This gem deserved more than the mere 1.5 stars Osborne and Co. rated it on TCM if only for recording parts of American history of the early 30s. ,positive
 This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. The misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission. Hilarity ensues. Like the Police Academy films the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat. I thought it was an engaging film and I will stop to watch it anytime it is on TV. No it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes. Plus Lauren Holly looks hot in a naval uniform. ,positive
 Lead actor Yuko Tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative The Milkwoman a tranquil canvass on missed chances in the life of a 50-something woman charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives. Played out in the picturesque tranquil town of Nagasaki Akira Ogata's unconventional romantic film so to speak is less a straight-out melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters' surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for. Perfectly embodying the requisite world-weariness subjected to a spiritless routine Tanaka plays Minako Oba a middle-aged woman who before her work shift at a supermarket takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly Nagasaki. One of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were high school sweethearts who courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents separated ways since then. Opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young Minako vowing never to leave Nagasaki Ogata does as such with the narrative patiently sticking with Minako as he deftly aided by Tanako's understated yet highly effective performance follows her -- whether she's having chitchat with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) on being single or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk -- as she and Kaita gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years. Such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast-paced narratives but for the rest it's a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically. ,positive
 Messiah was compulsive viewing from start to finish. The story centred on apparently random murders of men in London in various gruesome ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott)has to find the truth which to his surprise is a little closer to home than he might think. Gripping drama and Ken Stott was brilliant. Hopefully we have not seen the last of DCI Red Metcalfe. ,positive
 what can i say this film is amazing. it has its flaws like every film does for example wobbly headstones in a graveyard a clearly visible slide board during the penguins death scene Max Shreck losing his heavy coat in a split second between shots during the image consultancy scene batman losing his black eye makeup all of a sudden between shots so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman dialogue being recorded but is played back and spoken differently than when it was spoken in the first place and lastly Catwoman all of a sudden knows how to use a bull whip without any training whatsoever. these flaws are minor compared to some you would see in for example batman forever where the riddler can obviously be seen waiting for his cue or val Kilmer's hair changing between shots. what makes this film so deserving of an 8/10 is the great acting because the performances are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton reprises his role as Batman and has a lot more to do in this film. He looks more comfortable in the role the second time around and is on par with the villains performances. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non threatening character from the comics or TV show because now the character has more depth and has a far more interesting story that generates from the basic need of family and to feel accepted and wanted. this gives us an evil character who we feel sympathy for because he was rejected for being what he is which is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. she is sleet and sexy and she is also a villain we can feel sorry for because of the way she is victimised. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character even though he is not even in the batman universe. the soundtrack is far better than the first and Danny Elfman gets more of a chance to show off his musical talents this time around. The sets are amazing. They are detailed eye catching sinister Gothic unique dark and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they look. the costumes and make up are great and obviously a lot of work went into making them and all the work pays off because the Batsuit is better the cat suit is amazing to look at and the penguin make up and effects are so convincing.The animatronic penguins look really realistic and are played to good effect. The script is really good and the Storyline in my opinion is a plausible one. overall because of all these factors this film deserves an 8/10 and stands as my favourite of all the batman films ,positive
 This film flopped miserably in the UK and it didn't deserve to. The trailer of this film is slightly misleading and I guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was Atonement: Part 2 . While the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning film it's very different in tone. It focuses on an imagination of sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' life during the Second World War as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan's (Matthew Ryhs) childhood sweetheart Vera Phillips played by Keira Knightley. She was Dylan's first love in their homeland but the moment has passed and singer Vera only wants it as a beautiful memory. Or does she? Vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in Dylan's life Queen of Ireland love of my life mother of my child Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). The three form a sort of menage a trois in war-struck London but Vera then falls for a dashing soldier William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They quickly marry with Killick leaving for War. A frightened Vera convinces the Thomas' to return witb her to Wales but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of Vera's child William's jealousy and shell-shock after returning home and Caitlin realising she cannot share Dylan with her best friend. Filmed on a low budget this is more of a mood piece than anything else. It works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed. The performance of Sienna Miller is particularly excrellent (unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense detracts from the fact thats she's quite a talent) and Knightley and Murphy are once again very good. The let-down is Rhys as Dylan who while the Welsh poet himself was no bed of roses lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in Dylan. The writing is very choppy some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness. It's certainly worth watching however. ,positive
 Leos Carax has made 3 great movies: Boys Meet Girls Mauvais Sang Les Amants du Pont Neuf. In fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth the beauty of juvenile wilderness. Carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about about all he have seen but using it and melting it into his times. Pola X is a very different movie because Carax made Les Amants du Pont Neuf a monstruosity of 20 millions dollars a film that has destroyed everything on its way. After such a movie you can't do another one in the same point of view. So Leos Carax has to changed and he did. The movie isn't as beautiful as its first it's more reasonable no more studio no more dreamed Paris Carax has entered at last reality. It's not clean anymore it's not poetic characters. Carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it. ,positive
 Everyone told me to see Cactus Flower and I finally did. What a wonderful movie -- the perfect pick-me-up for a Sunday night/dreading Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good but Ingrid Bergman really made this movie -- after all it was really about her. The truly great actors can do anything and Miss Bergman proves it. She shows us -- in the course of one film -- a range few people display in their entire career. The scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching. Even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion I found myself cheering for Miss Dickinson as if she were the Boston Red Sox. Thankfully she made out (no pun intended) much better. ;) ,positive
 Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen's everyday's life? Is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions almost sympathetic towards judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self-seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by him. Trois couleurs: Rouge is based on the concept of UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW ON THE WORLD . The phone may be considered the main character of the story: after its performance in Dekalog 9 it gives in the beginning the encore to Kieslowski's onlookers followed step by step in its fast run across the world. The director looks deeply into the faculty of communication of human beings without taking up a definite position about the ethical side of individual behavior. Once again he points out to us the unpredictability of future events venting careful descriptions about strange courses and recourses of life separated from each other by a considerable number of years. Inexplicable combinations oddly converging in a series of continuous and upsetting situations. - Some books falling to the pavement. - One of them opening casually on a fatal page predetermining the destiny of a future profession as in a past similar occurrence. - Glimpses of daily life meeting fleetingly ideally joined by their fondness for the fictitious musician Van den Budermayer. - Human fortunes marked by the most ill-fated coincidence. In this piece of work deserving to be seen with our heart's eyes instead of our mind's ones we can witness a dialectic game between judge Jean Luis' (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut (Irene Jacob maybe the sweetest actress of our times together with the beautiful Winona Ryder) in a generational conflict between the experience of a world-weary old man and the self-conscious immaturity of a nice girl on the point of facing the steepest path of her ascending way. Kieslowski talks about dialogue tests between a disappointed human life and a youth unaware of her future between a spiritless misanthropist and a spontaneous girl full of good sense of unselfishness. And the final parade when the damp odor of tragedy still lingers in the air with all the main characters of the whole trilogy in full evidence saved by an accidental stroke of luck thank to the providential script cleverly written gives us the extreme greetings of this movie master fully used up by his great passion for cinema. Only a sense of bitter regret and emptiness is left to remind us the existence of a void impossible to fill. GOOD-BYE KRZYSZTOF. WE MISS YOU SO MUCH! ,positive
 Putney Swope is a unique low low low budget gem from the late 1960's which probably would have been forgotten in time if it hadn't been for two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who named Don Cheadle's character in Boogie Nights Buck Swope after the eponymous hero of this film) and the limited DVD release. Watching Putney Swope is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not make a lot of sense (at least to me it didn't upon watching it for the first time) but you have to respect the film for its passion and unabashedly rebellious message. I didn't understand a lot of things about Putney Swope but for the most part I liked it. The more I think about the movie the more it grows on me. The film is advertised as a parody of New York's Madison Avenue best known in the 1960's as the advertising capital of the world. Members of Generation X and Y may be lost on this concept but fortunately Mad Men is on TV to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of U.S. History. What you need to know before watching this movie is that these ad agencies were largely male and even more largely white establishments. With this premise in mind the movie opens up with an ad agency board meeting. The members are predominantly white except for Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dick Gregory in this film) the token African-American on the board. The board members are so self-absorbed and soulless that when their chairman falls dead in front of them their only concern is who will become chairman next. Without even removing the body from the boardroom they begin a paper ballot to elect the next chairman. Putney Swope is elected by a landslide but not because the other members think Swope is qualified. Voting for Swope was an ill-fated attempt for these board members to sabotage any other member's chance of being elected chairman. With their plans backfired Swope takes charge and sink(s) the boat firing all but one of the original members and hiring all people of color in their place . After this point the film became (for me) very weird and hard to follow plot-wise. There may not have even been a plot really. The whole idea of the film seems to be a what if scenario with the result being that the new Truth and Soul Inc. firm would be unconventional but successful nonetheless. The firm ends up making so much money that the members build a huge glass case to keep the cash in for unexplained purposes. It could be because Swope doesn't trust banks although that point is not touched upon or explained in the film. It could also be metaphoric in some way but who knows. Most of the movie takes place inside the ad agency with occasional scenes in the White House with a president who for some unknown reason is a midget. My assumption is here that some political joke was being made but I can't figure out what. Were the filmmakers saying that the president is a small insignificant part of American life? Were they saying that the latest elected officials (Nixon at the time) were insignificant candidates? I don't know. I found it a bit eerie however that the man playing the president bore a striking resemblance to future president Ronald Reagan. It is funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie was made. What this film may have benefited from is showing how consumers outside the ad agency reacted to the new ads. Of course the ad footage possessed a strange funny appeal for its unconventional creativity but did these ads convince people to buy the product? If so how? The movie hinted on the idea that the new ad campaign was successful through client interaction and the calls from the White House. However it would have been revealing to see average people since that demographic has always been most profitable for advertisers. Although the parodies and political messages this film may have made probably didn't stand the test of time this film still had a lot of unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor to him that benefited him greatly in this film. Swope's rough voice was actually director Robert Downey Sr.'s voice dubbed in sometimes poorly but fit the character so well in being an authoritative outsider. He hires and fires workers at random but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for revolutionizing the ad agency and seeking out new ideas. The premise of the film was and still is incredibly risky especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey Sr.). However this film declines to fall victim to negative black stereotypes which would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre years later. Although some of the sex scenes may be a bit off-putting for some viewers the main message is that a black owned and operated business can thrive through innovation and risk taking. Many people may not take a positive message away from this movie but I just did. Putney Swope remains an overlooked movie from a strange era and Downey Sr. (even despite his son's recent comeback) never quite got the recognition as a director he deserved. However if you find a DVD of this movie buy it and watch it. If it's on Netflix ditto. It's a movie that can be confusing at times but is worth watching for its gusto ambition and its non-conformist stature even by today's movie standards. ,positive
 I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable. The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on Siskel & Ebert .) But there are a thousand jokes sight gags to subtle references that more than compensate. I often find myself quoting lines (or singing I've Got Nothing to Hide ) and from time to time completely describe a scene which matches some conversation. There are at least six scenes which are among my all time favorite comedy bits. Viewers with no history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags. Here take it. * Visual of driving while waving butt out the window.* I said 'Is this seat taken?' Nice Burn! Visual of chaps headdress jockstrap & swim fins. * Yeah. I'm right handed. * Me! Me! says the woman trying to sell 'nads. * Bernie's going to love these. * That's my feet Jack. says the black feet. * Why should we tell you? ... SHE'S AT THE SUPERMARKET! * Ivy! on supermarket PA. * Loading whole shopping cart into ambulance. * etc. ,positive
 In Hoot a new kid arrives to Florida from Montana. He first faces the usual problems of blending in and dealing with the local bully. Soon though he becomes aware of a bigger problem: a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town right where a number of burrowing owls live. This movie has the look of a family film but it is pretty more radical than it seems as it shows sympathetically how Roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from lawbreaking (including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants) in the name of environmentalism (to save owls no less). Now one might agree or not with those actions but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions. A good solid film all in all. ,positive
 George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford Howard Hawks William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies The Philadelphia Story Adam's Rib Holiday Psycho melodramas Gaslight A Double Life a great semi western Heller in Pink Tights not to mention My Fair Lady or Travels with my Aunt He was at the service of his actors he never put himself in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness watching Rich and Famous flashes of the old master still very much in evidence. Candice Bergen gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the wonderful comedian she was about to become. Jacqueline Bisset is a throwback to the days of Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner steps in teasing us promising something spectacular that will eventually materialize in 1989 with Apartment Zero Meg Ryan as Bergen's daughter is already Meg Ryan. As tired as the formula is it remains a Cukor film and for what I gather one of Almodovar's favorite movies. ,positive
 Being advertised as the most expensive movie ever made in the Czech Republic it automatically makes the you think it will be over glorified and clichéd (out of fear of the budget). However with a budget of 8 Million and half the movie in English it was not exactly a big budget high risk movie. What we have a grand epic tale centered around the friendship of two people the younger Karel and the older Frantisek . As pilots in the Czech air force when the Germans invade before the beginning of world war II they escape the country to England to joined the RAF. Their friendship becomes strained through the love of the same woman. However there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond merely being friendly. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember they were not the winners the defeated the Germans only to be invaded by the Russians. Funny exciting intriguing beautiful sad and illuminating this movie is one of my favourite war movies. Most of all I like the way they make fun of the British in a way that is amazingly affectionate and gives an amazing insight into the way the British military fought WWII. Forget the recent American efforts (Peal Harbour Saving Private Ryan) this is the best WWII movie for a long time. ,positive
 I loved this film which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends and this movie was very real. I related to everything and savored every moment. The characters are believable the story poignant and the ending realistic but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically. The humor is subtle and at times dry and this makes it all the more realistic as it is woven into the daily escapades of the characters. It is so easy to identify with each of the situations portrayed. ,positive
 _The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_ and _The Wild Life_ comes up short. ------------ Some other stan wrote the above comment. Of course The Wild Life is no Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the quintessential 80s flica. However the Wild Life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place). The little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and he's straight disrespectful ( I got Visa...Masterrrrr Charrrrge!! ) The Colonel also makes an appearance ( Lawsuit... ). RIP The Colonel 1931-1997. This movie is no worse than a 6 in comparison to other genres btw. It is no worse than a 7 in terms of other 80s teen comedies at that. It does very much have the feel of a Cameron Crowe movie. Only staniels gave it a 5. ,positive
 Peak Practice was a British drama series about a GP surgery in Cardale  a small fictional town in the Derbyshire Peak District  and the doctors who worked there. It ran on ITV from 1993 to 2002 and was one of their most successful series at the time. It originally starred Kevin Whately as Dr Jack Kerruish Amanda Burton as Dr Beth Glover and Simon Shepherd as Dr Will Preston though the roster of doctors would change many times over the course of the series. The series was axed in 2002 and ended on a literal cliffhanger when two of the series main characters plunged off a cliff. Viewers wrote to ITV in their thousands and a petition for one last episode was set up by website Peak Practice Online. However all pleas were unsuccessful and ITV said they would not make any more episodes. Peak Practice was replaced by Sweet Medicine another medical series set in Derbyshire. It lasted a few episodes before it was dropped from the schedules. Cardale was based on the Derbyshire village of Crich and the series was filmed there and at other nearby Derbyshire towns and villages most notably Matlock and Ashover. After the end of this programme ITV attempted to launch a follow-up series called Sweet Medicine which extended the stories of different characters from the original show. ,positive
 A group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral parlor for a Halloween party. They get trapped inside and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally awakened. The possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) who floats and talks in a really deep voice. The remaining teens that haven't been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house. This is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects which include Linnea Quigley (who has a couple nude scenes as usual) gouging out a guy's eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipple. There's also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out. This is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza. The terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though. Overall I would give it a 7 out of 10. ,positive
 I had the honor this evening to see a screening of the movie These Girls at the Philadelphia Film Festival. Going into the movie I knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film's plot sounded interesting. So as I entered the theater just hours ago I wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down. These Girls is the story about three best friends from a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is the ringleader who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after High School but her father keeps pushing her to go to college which is something she doesn't want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) will be going away to a Christian school after the summer. And finally Glory (Amanda Walsh) who plans on spending her summer babysitting. But this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail Keith Clark (David Boreanaz) the sexy older hunk who they baby-sit for. Fun times and a lot of laughs ensue I normally don't like movies like These Girls but there is something about this movie that I really liked. I think the quality I liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality pick a hunky guy who lets all of them have sex with him only to be blackmailed by them later. It's a pretty funny tale about growing up friendship and sex but even though it sounds pretty cheesy I can see majority of this film happening in real life. The subject matter here is probably a main reason why this film didn't get a mainstream release in the United States. All the girls in this film are suppose to be under 18 which if I remember correctly two of them are 17 and one is 16. Now in the USA even though underage sex occurs on a daily basis many production or finance companies won't finance a film like this because of the sexual content. This information was actually confirmed by the director himself John Hazlett at the Q&A after the film. The thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this film aren't graphic and the nudity is minor. Not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life. Go figure. What the movie does best is it provides a lot of laughs as well as very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a Now & Then characteristic to them. The jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or over the top. Everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama. The script was very strong. The acting was very good for the most part. I thought all the three girls were great. Caroline Dhavernas who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time Wonderfalls was just terrific; as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh who both did a fine job as well. David Boreanaz did a good job and he looked like he was having fun while shooting most of the scenes. The guy played a pot head so it was funny seeing him play that role. I had the pleasure of meeting John Hazlett tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very appreciative of the comments made about the film. I am shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere. I think with a little marketing behind it it could have taken off. Sadly it's going to be one of these direct to DVD films which so few will ever have the pleasure to see. I think with what little budget Mr. Hazlett had to work with the film turned out well and I think he did a fine job directing this little gem. For someone who typically hates teen sex comedies I can honestly say I really enjoyed this film. The character development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused. This is a fine comedy because it has heart and spunk to it. I know I will be sure to buy this film when it comes on DVD on May 16 2006. If you're a fan of coming of age stories teen sex comedies or romantic comedies be sure to check this film out because it's one of the funniest films of its kind to be released in years. MovieManMenzel's final rating for These Girls is an 8/10. ,positive
 Let us assume for a moment that you haven't experimented with the psychotropic mushroom and you're wondering about the so called bad experience and just how something like that might play itself out Well go ahead and pop in a fresh copy of The Beguiled. See with film you have your clean trips (Solaris and anything else directed by Andrei Tarkovsky) whack trips i.e. the experience-from-which-you-never-recover (Sweet Movie and El Topo) and you're bad organic trips a category specifically reserved for a film like The Beguiled which is the sort of content those keen writers at the Times who made all the right decisions with their lives and graduated from the Harvard Department of English refer to as hallucinogenic in tone. By the third act of this Don Siegel directed movie you may not exactly observe that your two lead-heavy hands have become shrunken and assume all the characteristics of a burrowing insectivorous mammal nor will you exactly fall under the suspicion that your spine has achieved the same sinuous shape and knotty texture of a pomaceous fruit baring tree incalculable in age but you will feel something. In 1970 when this film was filmed most Americans were looking for an anodyne for their collective pain a movie like The Graduate perhaps a lot of world-endism was going on and of course you had the nightmare break down of war in Vietnam. What you get with The Beguiled banal drug metaphors aside is a screenplay adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as Grimes Grice and direction from the director who helped bring about the work and career of Sam Peckinpah. In the Beguiled Donny Siegel born in 12 Chicago Il. less than 45 years after The Great Fire is showing his attempt at grappling with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970's in the form of a classical film artifact. The Beguiled is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect: the shooting editing direction and story are all fantastic and you're not likely to see anything else like it. Undoubtedly a sinister film its effects as I've said both dizzying and adulterating; frankly it's hard to believe would ever Universal attached its name to this picture but you are going to see upon viewing some of the sweet sweet camera moves and cinematographer Bruce Surtees exploiting every bit of dark myth you harbor in your head about the American Plantation South conflating beauty with evil in every location shot. Clint Eastwood needless to say has never been like this. Old Clint he moves at instant from coy to livid his eyes like two Archimedean spirals in medium close up. The rest of the cast is equally exacting and uncanny. This Beguiled will never make the AFI 100 in my lifetime but that doesn't stop me from positing that it's one of the best American synch sound films ever made. While most people catalogue it as a western to include the folks at The Western Channel The Beguiled is a problem because you don't really know what it is: A sort of war movie? A drama? Psychological thriller? Maybe the answer to all those emotionally wrought Noir films starring Kirk Douglas? I actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man who likes to kick back with the cheap gratuitous violence projected in entertainments like The Wire saw that high angle medium long shot of Geraldine Page wrapping a tourniquet around Clint's bloody leg Pa was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the Outback Bowl right before he absconded to another room. My advice: watch this one and make sure it is on a very large screen preferably run on that DPL home theater projector you're contemplating. I would put The Beguiled right on order along with that important consumer purchase turn the overheads out throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall and try not to lose your grip because just like Norman Bates We all go a little mad sometimes even the beguiled. ,positive
 It must be said that the director of The Cell Tarsem Singh has quite handily established himself with his first feature which happens to rank as one of the most visually astounding films in contemporary cinema. The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a film. As a thriller it rises above most of its peers with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere. However it is ultimately Tarsem's skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the film's jolting sense of terror. As with several recent films I have been shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have commented negatively about The Cell; in defence of the film I will address a few of these issues. The plot appears to be the main concern and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from The Silence of the Lambs it was never intended to be the most important aspect of the film; the plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision--simultaneously horrifying and wondrous--is presented to the audience much in the same way that the plot of The Silence of the Lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two lead characters Lecter and Starling. While The Silence of the Lambs is clearly the superior film it is irrational for one to condemn the plot of The Cell and in the same breath praise that of The Silence of the Lambs. My final concern is the mention of MTV style directing. It pains me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques. A camera has the potential to be much more than simply a tool with which to record events; angles pans colour adjustment and so forth are all used to their full extent in The Cell with the purpose of creating the sense of a dream-like state that could not have been otherwise achieved. This is essential to the film as the entire premise behind it is the visualization of a serial killer's subconscious. If you simply want a series of static shots stick to stage plays and give up cinema altogether. That being said The Cell is thoroughly entertaining terrifying and breathtaking in both its pacing and design. Anyone who is able to look past the--perhaps uninspired yet never dull--screenplay will find one of the best films of the year 2000. ,positive
 Night hunter is a sold B style action movie. Get a life and grow up people. Don the Dragon Wilson is a kick boxer (hall of fame) and not an actor. If your looking for an Oscar it's not here brother. Looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget this is it.The plot line may have been a little thin but what B movie isn't. I understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure. Get real people judging every movie like it is an Oscar contender just silly. Awesome fight scenes mixed with a new twist on vampire moves. See it if your a fan rent something else if your a hater. ,positive
 I'm a horror movie freak and this has got to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks I've ever seen. The plotline is totally original (who else would think up a town who gets totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity?) the special effects are amazing and the cinematography couldn't be better. Some may find it disturbing but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It also makes a good point. The spiral symbol is kinda ubiquitous. The spiral notebook spiral seashells spirals on cakes. Of all the shapes they could have used (square triangle trapezoid rectangle) this was one of the best choices. If you can find this movie definitely see it. It's certainly unique and quite unforgettable. ,positive
 This production of Hamlet Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations it does have the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. Jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed Prince is multi-layered and riveting. His displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow love to vengefulness and everywhere else on the map but without seeming forced or over-the-top. In fact some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them with stillness soft speech and thoughtful expression. As to whether or not he interprets Hamlet as mad or sane...well you should decide for yourselves; I changed my mind more than once. At one point it seems he has thought himself sane and merely playing at madness but suspects that he is actually mad after all...a revelation to himself captured beautifully. Having performed the part of Hamlet on stage more times than any other actor in history Jacobi's affinity for the role then comes as little surprise. As for the production itself it is presented as a kind of filmed-copy of the stage play with little special effects or fancy camera work minimal sets and no musical accompaniment to speak of. This production relies on the acting prowess of the cast and the words of Shakespeare to evoke the emotion and interest of its audience. And it works. The other players are top-notch as well particularly Patrick Stewart's Claudius and Claire Bloom's Gertrude. Together the cast present a seamless ensemble. The last (but far from least) element that makes this production stand out is the play itself. Here it is presented in its entirety a rarity on film. But oddly enough I never noticed the time. I was too busy getting caught up in the story. I suspect that you will too. ,positive
 As Muppet movies go this is easily and clearly the best. It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age a solid script and some great Disneyesque songs and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Henson's talent. The story is basic and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable. This is simply fun but it is also a well made well written beautifully endearing classic. It rates an 8.9/10 from... the Fiend :. ,positive
 I can't believe I missed this one. Made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent episode of a TV soap this is 90 minutes of sustained sharp as a knife film making. You will find the outline plot etc elsewhere on this site.Consider though that the whole thing was shot using a single hand- held 16mm camera... all the dialogue is improvised... none of the 'actors' had appeared in front of a camera before... It sounds like a recipe for disaster. Instead what we get is hippies v cops running around in the California desert in what evolves into a 'that's not fair.. i'm on that person's side'scenario. The only problem is the director keeps making you shift your allegiance and at the end of 90 minutes we're still not sure who has one. Brilliant... Quite brilliant. ,positive
 This film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe. While it is fairly accurate in its description of the events leading up to and the subsequent investigation regarding the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993 seen now post 9/11 it is almost unbearable. It would be a mistake to call this film prophetic but it certainly makes the common playground wisdom of fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me come alive. Our government learned nothing from the 1993 attempt on the World Trade Center and subsequent readings of the 9/11 Report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeated. Some people have criticized the First and Fourth Amendments of the US Constitution as being partly responsible for the Islamic terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans but that is wrong headed in every possible way. Surely the people making this argument are not supporting a ban on Free Speech a free press or freedom of religion? I certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any person's home or office to search without cause or without a warrant. The fact is the FBI the INS and even the local police could have gotten warrants based on the information they had in their possession but they chose not to for a variety of reasons. Besides no matter how distasteful or ignorant it is it is not illegal to speak badly about America or its leaders. Likewise it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward Mecca. Consider this until Lee Harvey Oswald actually fired his rifle at President John Kennedy he wasn't really breaking any laws. Living in a free society has its drawbacks. Still Path To Paradise is a must see film that I am afraid will never be seen by that many people. As far as I know it is not on DVD and 2007 is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals of it. I'm not really surprised people don't like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs right and for the pettiest of reasons like jurisdictional squabbles and a refusal to share information. This is a shame as Path To Paradise is well done and gripping and as many have stated before the final scene where Ramzi Yousef (played by Art Malik) the bomber who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt at destroying the two towers is flying past the World Trade Center after his capture and extradition simply says Next time we will bring them both down is a film moment that froze me in place for several minutes. ,positive
 me and a coupla friends form university - alberto lopez dave hall celina alcock (we graduated from uea norwich uk in 1997) still get together and watch b-movies once a month. We are consummate experts in the art of bad movie-making and this film was quickly placed in the top 10 of awful/brilliant movies. so if you've just got the beers and weed in and need a film to laugh like a drain at DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX 2 is the film for you! Marc Singer is totally aware he's in a turkey of a film here and milks it for everything he can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his wooden acting and musclebound moronity (is that a word??) as he grunts But I want my 20 thousand! Pure Shlock Gold! If you liked this also see: TRANCERS THE RUNESTONE DOLLMAN and anything by Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray.....(but be warned: some of their films are completely and utterly without merit and you'll be screaming for those lost hours of your life!!!?!). ,positive
 I love a film that mixes edge-of-the-seat suspense laughs style good acting and a bit of self-parody. Hitchcock consistently carried this off and in Le Cercle rouge Jean-Pierre Melville does the same. I was sorry when this long film ended. I agree with the English commenter who found remarks by one of my compatriots chauvinistic. I love French films Italian films English films Indian films--and the increasingly rare good American films. I also feel the writer who panned the film for being not even a good copy of an American gangster film missed the point completely. But I guess it's like jazz: either you get it or you don't so why waste time trying to explain. Just see Le Cercle noir and be prepared to be deliciously entertained. ,positive
 Its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown. I don't think Alan Bates has done a better film than this. Its never shown on television. The only time I can recall it being shown on British TV was in the summer of 1998. I have it on tape but sadly the quality isn't great due to a dodgy aerial at the time... I remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on TV. It was shown on Channel 4 in the early hours of the morning thereby ensuring that it still remained unseen except for a very small audience. I was living in Bristol at the time and it was ironic that when I finally saw the film I realised that I had walked past the VERY house where it was filmed several times before!! The film treads a fine line; a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic predicament of coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes. The direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of lapsing into bad taste. A couple of years ago I saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with Eddie Izzard in the role of Bri and Victoria Hamilton playing Sheila. It showed Izzard improvising and larking about and Hamilton jokingly telling the audience to ignore him when he's being like this. I maybe taking this out of context as I only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful. Izzard was praised for his performance but I felt uncomfortable with what I saw. It is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed. This is one of the best British films of the 70s and hopefully it will be released on DVD one day. ,positive

 Although I haven't seen it yet I know that Chaplin is a genius and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about Hitler. All great satire is based on going out on an edge. Also all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. This film seems like it will skirt both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. And hopefully through laughter we can learn to view the world in a new light. Another film that does this that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground and Fando And Lis. So let me watch the film first. ,positive
 Spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time. And as far as I know it's also the only one that focuses on the L.A. Punk Explosion of the early eighties. It's all there: not just great great bands like Black Flag Fear X the Germs whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over-estimated but also the promoters the media and first of all the audiences - the punks - all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy the anger and the fury these youths put into their music. Where is that today? The eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music but the underground was rocking. If you need a proof for that watch Fear's performance in Decline. Unmatched. Great film! How come this is not available on vid LD or DVD? P.S. The follow-up Decline Pt. II is hilarious too ,positive
 I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. Although a musical I thought Rita Hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. As far as her dancing I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Rita's dancing in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it Betty Grable was an excellent dancer. The cinematography and vivid colors are also noted. Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she's also in love with her mentor played by Gene Kelly. Does she leave Kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and Broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? You'll have to watch the film to find out! ,positive
 I was referred to this movie by a friend. I had never heard of it but I thought it had Christopher Lampbert so I rented it and come to find out that wasn't Christopher Lampbert it was Thomas Jane who was great it this film. I love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house. The characters were great everyone of them and the script was amazing I really wish Skip Woods would write and direct another movie. In my book Thursday is the flawless tale of this guy trying to do the wife and kid thing after a shady past but then his old drug dealer buddy shows up and it becomes quite the Thursday. This is one of my favorite movies and it shows some real potential in Thomas Jane. But this movie is very rare but I have found it in a couple of Hollywood Video's on VHS. So dust off the old VCR and pop in Thursday because it gets Pee Wee's seal of approval ,positive
 This totally odd-ball feature is a typical and prime example of satanically shocking 70's horror. The events are thoroughly confusing and it takes up quite a while before you figure out what the hell is going on but the brooding atmosphere sucks you in immediately. Right from the indescribably bizarre intro showing a couple of eerie children turning toys into real-life war machinery you just know this become an uncompromising and gritty shocker. Brotherhood of Satan soon appears to be another installment in the alleged & unofficial creepy little town hiding a dark secret sub genre. A young widower traveling with his new yummy girlfriend and 8-year-old daughter stops in a remote little town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway. The villagers behave very hostile and insist the visitors on leaving right away. The town clearly bathes in an ambiance of fear and panic as local children vanish inexplicably vanished and unnatural forces maintain everyone within the boundaries of town. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult apparently ruled by the elderly members of the community. I really liked Brotherhood of Satan a lot. The story reminded me of a novel written by John Saul but I can't remember the title. It also dealt with a cult of elderly people abusing youthful villagers for their own greedy merits. The film mainly relies on creepy scenery (like dolls and witchcraft relics) but a slightly more involving and coherent screenplay would have been nice. The subject matter often raises a lot of issues and questions and director Bernard McEveety can't always provide us with answers. The climax is terrific very seventies (meaning shocking) and unforgettable. Beautifully shot film too. ,positive
 The story was well plotted and interesting by itself. However it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you. To avoid that I am not going to talking the story here. I regard this film as a good adaption of Sarah Water's book as compared with the previous one Tipping the velvet . I read the book first and then watched the DVD later. The film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book. Of course due to the time limitation the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part III of the book. Therefore it couldn't illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of Mr. Ibbs's place and those after that (even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene). Despite that the film actually did a good job in representing the story. It really worth watching. It's still unclear when BBC-America can broadcast this film. That's pity. PS: noticed that the ages of Maud and Sue were set to be 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses. ,positive
 This outlandish Troma movie is actually a very good movie. It is known as their epic and best and most highly rated production. Their version of Shakespeare's play is extremely funny with the usual dose of Troma nudity and gore. Troma has made some very good gore films one of my favorites is Street Trash and of course the Toxic Avenger movies. I have one Troma movie Terror Firmer which has a reputation as their goriest and nastiest movie. I enjoyed Tromeo and Juliet so much that I need to finally watch Terror Firmer . This is a 2-disc Collector's version with four commentaries and many many features. Tromeo and Juliet is an absolute hoot and highly recommended. ,positive
 One of the classic low budget 70's movies this film was found in a bargain video shop in London for only 50p. (interestingly the package lists the star of the film as 'Charles Bone' who sounds like a porn star but once the credits role it's obvious that the picture is aligned to far the right of the TV screen so that all the cast members have the last letter missing from their names) From the moment the narrator lamely introduces us to the situation that the desperate tenants of a grimy New York City apartment block you know you're in for a rollercoaster ride of fromage. The direction is from the 'Ed Wood one-take' school - if one or two extras were looking at the camera crew then what the hell? The films finishes with a plot twist that puts The Usual Suspects to shame. Buy it now. ,positive
 Certainly this film has the ring of truth about it as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a Marine base. It deals with the attempted cover-up by the local Marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a Marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend a Marine captain. The man and woman had been lovers but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married. He continued to stalk her going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time. Finally he broke into her home attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed. The civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense but the Marines decided to charge the captain with murder. The major you see was a decorated hero from Vietnam and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the Marine base. The captain too had made some enemies in her motor pool command rejecting some male advances in a very butch style. There is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama which the very capable cast gets across nicely. The director and editor however seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view. You're lucky if you know where you're at most of the time. Bear with them though; it's a worthwhile story as the captain's court martial trial unfolds and it seems every man's hand is against her even her attorney at times. The verdict? Well after all this is rather a suspense story so you'll have to see for yourself. There is a kind of pacifist message folded into the film but forget about that. Sure war is hell but sometimes it can't be avoided. We'll need those Marines then even if they aren't always the best champions of fair play internally. As Kipling says in his poem Tommy Atkins : It's Tommy this and Tommy that And Tommy wait outside. But it's room for Mr. Atkins When the troopship's on the tide.  ,positive
 It is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in Africa as they are definitely too few. However the movie depicts Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one... I felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man. There was too little content explaining how the man got to rise in the first place and the whole context of Belgium letting them go . So it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent especially Mobutu himself. I would just have liked a better political analysis. ,positive
 I first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax. As we all know betamax went the way of the 8-trak tape sigh it really had nice picture quality too. Anyways I'm glad I found this movie again I've been searching for it for more than 10 years! This movie falls into the category of movies like Airplane: continuous jokes oneliners funny actions (bodylanguage). Mark Blankfield is absolutely hilarious. His transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll into the sex-crazed partyanimal Mr. Hyde is unforgettable complete with goldtooth chesthair and goldchains. The part I loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to Madam Woo Woo's. Totally psychedelic experience without the drugs! If you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it. When I first seen it I had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing. This is a movie I could watch over and over again. I highly recommend it. ,positive
 Jimmy Stewart brings the story of Charles Lindbergh to life as he almost narrates the entire film while he crosses the Atlantic. It well edited with flashbacks over Lindeberghs life. Franz Waxman score is shear brilliant and truly gives the picture a heroic feel. One of Stewarts finest roles and this film can deliver time after time. Look for appearances by Murray Hamilton ( The Mayor in the JAWS Movie) as Bud Gurney.Comes out on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of a few more of Stewarts classic films. I consider Jimmy Stewart to be Americas greatest Actor and never tire of seeing him in any film I see watch this picture and you'll agree. ,positive
 There is no denying it. Sci-fi on TV is difficult. There are so many problems that the genre brings with it. Like the need for a good budget solid writing decent acting. Perhaps the budget and the script writing is the departments where i feel most attempts have failed. So does Surface succeed? Not completely but more so than most. The way i see it a good sci-fi show doesn't really need a lot of CGI to work nor does it need a ton of money. What it needs is the capacity to create a larger-than-life feeling. The feeling that there is more than meets the eye something to make me curious and willing to try and figure out how it's going to end. Adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying Aha! is what makes or breaks a show like this one. Surface had a couple of flaws. First of all it's basic premise is not as exciting as it could have been nor is the revealed story as exciting (or daring) as i hoped in the beginning. Also the TV-feeling is very present much of the time. All the way from the crappy CGI (that ranges from decent to awful) to the rather shifting quality in the acting department. Also it feels sometimes a bit too family-oriented in that it takes the edge of sometimes and becomes almost cutesy. But aside from these flaws it's an enjoyable show. Maybe not as spectacular as some of the other sci-fi shows out there. But it manages to keep me interested the whole season and it offers a couple of nice cliffhangers between shows as well. The ending for me is not that appealing. I don't like shows that end without ending so to speak leaving the story unresolved. It's especially unfortunate in this case since the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it is as of yet undecided). HBO is to me the benchmark for quality television. Their series have the best actors the best production values and above all the most solid writing. This is not HBO-quality but it's good for what it is. Good enough to want another season without a doubt. ,positive
 I suspect there's some revisionist history going on here but one definitely comes away with the feeling that Patrice Lumumba was a trouble-maker who incited his people to violence from the moment the Congo declared independence.His inability to control his people and his decision to bring in Soviet help to get his military back in line was obviously what got the United States involved and led to his assassination.However by replacing him with Mobutu the United States didn't solve anything.They made the situation just as bad.Well-acted with excellent cinematography and a rousing score.Definitely worth seeing. ,positive
 His John Dark-Kevin Connor fantasy adventures were a mainstay of Summer holiday movies in the days before Star Wars: they weren't masterpieces they didn't boast state-of-the-art special effects but they were exactly what an audience of kids wanted from a film back in the mid 70s. At the Earth's Core catches just the right tone for the appropriately named Burroughs' pulp adventure about Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure ending up in the underground world of Pelucidar and battling its evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs. This time the puppets are gone in favour of men in monster suits which is a lot more fun if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and if you're not there's always Caroline Munro's cleavage to look at. Aside from what may well be Peter Cushing's worst performance an irritating but dottier rehash of his movie Dr Who ( You can't mesmerise me I'm British! ) it's easily the best of the John Dark-Kevin Connor-Doug McClure fantasy adventures surprisingly well directed and boasting an atmospheric use of colour. Never especially good at exterior scenes Alan Hume's photography gains immensely from the control a studio set gives him (the film was shot entirely on soundstages) to paint a luridly vivid world worthy of a pulp novel cover. Not high art but definitely great Saturday matinée fun. ,positive
 An interesting and involved film about a lifer just trying to live out his days peacefully. Elements of the main character appear in Michael Mann's later films like Thief (1981) Heat (1995) and so on. You can see this one at the UCLA Instructional Media Laboratory-- one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public. It's a great one! ,positive
 The Seven-Ups is a good and engrossing film. It's packed with credible performances by Scheider LaBianco and an effective scary performance by Richard Lynch - although most of the characters are card-board cut-out tough guys. Character development does not evolve at all on the screen. The only thing we know is the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are bad. Deviating from the crime story norm The Seven-Ups manage to throw Scheider and crew into the middle of a building plot in a unique writing twist. Onsite locations of New York City and an excellent choreographed car chase highlight the film. The only downside of the film is the slightly confusing plot line in the beginning. They give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are mob related (until later in the film). Had someone blindly started watching the film may be slightly confused on the story. Otherwise The Seven-Ups is a gritty testosterone-filled enjoyable time. ,positive
 I consider Saboteur as Hitchcock's first American film because the story takes place completely in U.S. There are brilliant scenes in this film. Statue of Liberty Scene Barry Kane jumping into the water from the bridge Water fall scene are amazing. Its not Hitchcock's fault that he didn't get the actors he wanted. Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper for the leading roles in Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper wasn't interested in doing a thriller. Another reason why Hitchcock didn't get big stars was because he wasn't one of top directors. Although Rebecca was a huge success still most of film's success went to Producer David O. Selznick. For Example David O. Selznick got Best Picture Oscar for Rebecca. And Hitchcock didn't get a Best Director Oscar for Rebecca. Hitchcock started getting some attention after Foreign Correspondent (1940). But Universal gave him a low-budget for Saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea for this film because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again with a low salary. He enjoyed working with Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent (1940). But he was unavailable. So the role went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock called Robert Cummings a competent performer. I thought he did his best. He was a less known actor who was willing to play a role when many big actors refused to play the leading male role. As for leading female role Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck for the leading role. They weren't interested either. So Universal decided to give the role to Priscilla Lane. I read in a book that this was one of her favorite films. I also liked the scene at Blind Man's house. That is my favorite scene. If we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in Uncle Philip's house then we will see how intense it is. Uncle Philip (Blind Man) was studying Barry Kane's character the moment he entered his house. The moment Barry entered his house he heard Barry's handcuffs. Through conversation he realized that Barry Kane isn't a criminal at all. We also see his hearing ability through those scenes. For Example Barry hears the sound of a car says Is that a car coming? Uncle Philip says 2 cars I think. Uncle Philip was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane did a fine job playing her role. She was no big star. But I thought her performance was really good. Another brilliant scene in Uncle Philip's house is the scene where he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin) Are you frightened Pat? Is that what makes you so cruel? I thought Otto Krueger played the villain brilliantly. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey for the villain. But he refused. Harry Carey is famous for his role Mr. President in Mr. Smith goes to Washington. I want to mention more about this film. But I think my post is getting too long. Every Hitchcock film is special in its own way. I am sure Hitchcock fans will like this film. I rate 10 out of 10. ,positive
 Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004)is a beautifully made film that takes small carefully positioned steps towards its ending that need to be savoured in order to be enjoyed. From the contrasting landscapes to the tightly enclosed world that the hero inhabits we are taken by the Director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel. We like the hero will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminally driven Mafia world. That the film resists Mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful. The concrete grave the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business and no more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love or living for self family or others. Our hero is indeed a hero in that he gives up his life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape his decorative prison. The consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time. See it!! ,positive
 Although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out this is a total lie. In fact apart from the opening segment the film isn't even a horror movie. With its sunken treasure legions of fish people and mad scientists it's a lot more like a Doug McClure adventure movie. Obviously this film is no work of art but it's kind of fun to watch... Just be warned that the beginning is quite gory. ,positive
 This film like much of their music is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and in many ways ahead of its time. The images are funny disturbing and at the very least engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the candy pop sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt. HEAD alone should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there? ,positive
 I thoroughly enjoyed Manna from Heaven. The hopes and dreams and perspectives of each of the characters is endearing and we the audience get to know each and every one of them warts and all. And the ending was a great wonderful and uplifting surprise! Thanks for the experience; I'll be looking forward to more. ,positive
 this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity truth fun talent and circumstance that make for MAGIC. from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best if i hadn't have known better i would have thought there was an elaborate script here. what you get: a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it's own entity. peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts....... only small actors and everyone involved here should be patted on the back taken out to dinner and be considered for an Oscar. well done! ,positive
 In my personal opinion - «The Patriot» is one of the best Steven Seagal movies. I've heard people say it's the worst one ever it's not like SS etc. I disagree. As a highly spiritual person a great master Seagal established a good tradition in action movies. He always has a good background great action high professionalism and a clever message. This movie has it all. You have good shooting scenes great aikido. Although there isn't a lot of it it shows us its peaceful side. This change in his film making only proves his spiritual growth (he doesn't kill Chisolm's buddy in the end). «The Patriot» is definitely one of the best films from the «filmmaker's» point of view which I have seen lately. You have great panoramic shots of Montana we see real American nature and beautiful wildlife(among others - horses and flowers). The soundtrack also deserves a few words. During the film I had a great opportunity to listen to classical American-cowboy-western music(not Country though). Similar music was heard in «Back to the Future Prt.3». SS's acting has greatly improved since his last films. His role is unfamiliar to him(unlike cops & commandos) but he does a good job playing the-retired-doctor-from-the-government. His acting is convincing and his lines are good. I was really pleased with the cast. LQ Jones proves that life & death walk the Earth together Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and clever scientist Camilla Belle makes a great appearance as McClaren's daughter. Mr.Seagal discusses the much debated «Real American» tradition and the militia squads providing his own point of view(he likes the Constitution just fine but chubby bearded men have nothing to do with it). Also good points are raised regarding the Eastern-Western Medicine system and nature. Seagal's best. And opening new horizons in his film career. ,positive
 The only complaint I heard about this film was that it was slow. Though perhaps this is the point. The two characters clash unforgivingly and the slow build-up of tension between them is anxiety-producing. The intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialog take the tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument shocks the audience. Istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy scenery captivating and the plot is thrilling - not in that look the hero blew up yet another car and he's now flying with his motorcycle kind of way though. I had chills down my spine as the characters moved in and out of each other's spheres and watched the fog engulf Istanbul. ,positive
 I watched Love Life on holiday when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida. It was a lovely surprise to find a British film that wasn't derivative or exploitive. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. The transitions between scenes I found a bit distracting but as whole I think Love Life is a winner a ruby in the dust. One for all the family. A pleasant change to see a British film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words. Try and see it. ,positive
 Expectacular THE ATOR's second part!! Directed rapidly by JOE D'AMATO specialist in all kinds of subkinds(subgenres) of exploitation and interpreted again by MILES O'KEEFFE. the budget of the movie debio to be derisory or minimal. In spite of not being a better movie of his antecesora not mas entertained ATOR 2 either it has something something that makes it enterteining. His introduction you prop it explains ATOR's origin to us with images of the first part. The script is incredible is like any comic-book of the brilliant ROY THOMAS. has so fantastic elements inside dle world of the SWORD and such FANTASY as invisible men black gentlemen cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain this one interpreted brilliant. The final this struggle very well. lacking mas violence and blood but this one well. Never it becomes boring. It has everything what there was lacking ATOR 1. Be charmed with to my me!! 4/5 ,positive
 This cartoon documents the second encounter between Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner and is definitely better than their first meeting in Fast and Furry-ous (1949). If measured by aesthetic value then this cartoon would not rank among the top 5 or 6 of the year 1952. Regardless this is a very funny short. Coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris) chases the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the road and gets completely tired out. The ingenious scientific Latin names of the characters are very original and has been mimicked before in other un-related cartoons. The coyote collapses and puts on a wonderful expression of- I don't know -boredom. Such Jonesesque expressions make this cartoon provide more than its fare share of laughs in seven minutes. Then he has an idea and another laughable expression is worn. The slapstick jokes are all hilarious and mask the fact that it is truly evil to inflict such pain on a poor helpless GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows but who cares? The old rocket gag is present too. Coyote straps himself to a rocket which should produce enough oomph for him to catch up with Roadrunner and grab him. Instead the rocket shoots up into the air and becomes a firework in the distance: Eat at Joe's. This classical gag originates from this cartoon; though obvious it still makes people laugh. The highlight truly is the chase through the mineshaft. The two wear helmet-lights and we see the tunnel through which the two are going with only the lights visible. Here the comedy reaches a peak. A must-see sequence maybe even the best sequence in the early days of Roadrunner. The final touch is provided by the writing of Michael Maltese as Coyote's light goes out and he unknowingly lights a match in a room full of explosives the surface is shown where a bunch of cactus jump and spell out the letters YIPE! after the blast. Such small things make you laugh all through a mere seven minutes and as soon as it starts the fun's all over. The rocket skates are another good idea as is the free drink of water and the anvil on the tight-rope (a sequence that appears in Space Jam [1996]). To give the results of those away would be useless. The free drink proves to be a problem for Wile E. at the end of the second-last sequence: namely the rocket skates. This classical cartoon is littered with fine animation except for the characters. Though they are animated very well the two characters are very primitive; which might be an understatement. Though at first it may seem weird the humor of the ensuing sequences makes one forget. If you like vintage Jones watch this. If you LOVE Roadrunner get this on video. Excellent entertainment (Rating: 8/10). ,positive
 I enjoyed this movie okay it just could have been so much better. I was expecting more action than what I got...which was more of a comedy than anything else. Granted it was serious in parts and it had a good fight scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all. Which is hard to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another his sister is going through a difficult break up but she is being pursued by a vampire of all things. Granted this vampire is rather nice and not into sucking blood. So that is all there is really to it except for a plot of another vampire after certain royal vampires so he can gain ultimate power. Some of the problems with this movie is that its plot went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow to it that and it seemed to shift genres a bit much too. One minute action the next pure comedy. However the girls were cute there is good action the comedy was worthy of a chuckle or two and Jackie Chan makes a rather energetic appearance or two. This movie probably just needed more development in some areas such as the villain who is basically not really explored at all. So for a movie with a few good fights and a chuckle or two this is rather good...though why was it rated R? I have seen stuff we have made that is PG-13 that is a lot worse than this. ,positive
 It starts a little slow but give it a chance. In the spirit of the Wackiest Ship in the Arm and the Pink Sub this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and pirate crew makes him walk the plank. In contrast Kelsey Grammar(similar to Cary Grant)does not take anything to serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot. From the beered up fisherman in Charleston harbor to the whale decoy their antics took me by surprise and I laughed out loud. ,positive
 Vanaja is a film of superlatives. It has an exceptionally well thought-out cast with Mamatha being the crowning jewel a superb production and possibly pre-production with Rajnesh at the helm a fantastic journey of rural Southern India through the eyes of a 15 year old a remarkable mixture of song and dance traditional and modern blended perfectly and a beautiful backdrop of lush color of the flora and fauna that make up the magnificent experience. What a towering achievement for a debut director!! The casting was absolutely dead-on. I wish India would come out with more of such films. This film will remain as one of my top favorites for my entire life. 9/10. ,positive
 The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast. The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there The screenplay is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsden's Center for Cultural Arts. After the film ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still bothered . While we put an 18 and up age restriction on the film I would watch the film with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation. ,positive
 The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again so what? It's got lovable characters it's well shot the acting is mostly good it never becomes too maudlin or dramatic it's quirky. Look at how many people love I Dream of Jeannie. Is it perfect? Heck no! And while this is very different I say check it out and you'll be in a good mood after you see it. ,positive
 'Identity . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separate from them and it's being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what's inside our identity is everything that's ever happened to us' (Ntozake Shange qtd in Fires in the Mirror ). Pieces like Decalogue V used to intimidate me. I felt that if I accepted them than I would be compromising something. What I thought before really isn't worth getting into. I understand what Naturalism is trying to say. I experienced a tangible katharsis and one that fell into existence piecemeal and one that's still alive that I still have to reckon with. It's still working inside me. The film wasn't sympathetic per se. It doesn't need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing. There are certainly wicked people; whether or not they should die is for another film. What Decalogue shows is that good beautiful people exists who kill other people when their society and primal urges jack them up. The 'science' of naturalism is what has helped me to appreciate Decalogue V. It's not worth the writing space to go into why I would not let myself before but I see now the worth in making art like this to 'make' people or perhaps to make people do something. There's a method to Lazar's compromise of his . . . light. Much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect. This should not be too strange of an idea: after all how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect. I wince when I say it but Naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when I have the power to say to myself 'this ruin this process this natural process makes me want to buck the system.' I do not think Naturalism is painting a doomsday portrait of humanity telling us to give up our powdered wigs and head to the woods. Instead I think that it is cataloging proofs and experiments that we are of course free to ignore. We can ignore it all we want if we want to give the Naturalists more corpses to bury. For surely despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy towards their characters' likely and catastrophic fate they are impassioned by readerly inaction and writerly snobisme. I do see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience will understand what's to be done with what they see. As has been mentioned there's danger in the hopeless seeing their fate immortalized in stone. There's danger in the hopeful disparaging the Natural because it doesn't correspond to their world view. And I don't think that the 'hopeful' need be either wealthy or fortunate. I have not seen it but it seems that the film American Beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstance as a provider of vision or comfort. There are ascetics as well as gluttons as well as beggars who wonder where within themselves their humanity is who grieve because they can't find anything that separates them from their landscape. Landscapes can be powerfully and beautifully portrayed but in reality landscapes do not enact. They change sure and dramatically but only by a large set of Natural law which no one truly have power over. But it cannot be changed itself. ,positive
 I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart and this film is equally good. This slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived. Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister who live in a small room over an auto shop. There are no parents; they are on their own surviving. Ali supplements his income by stealing auto parts selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy on the subway. Izzie supplements her income working a food truck by selling herself. They are trying to make money to but their own truck. One is tempted to express outrage at the fact that these two children are left to fend on their own and certainly one can be very upset that Izzie sells her body to willing truckers but the fact is that this exists today in the world's richest country not some underdeveloped land. Save the outrage and do something. ,positive
 I'm not sure as to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy film. When I first watched this I couldn't really make out the ending and that's the only part of movie that's seemed to lack depth and left me a bit depressed for awhile. Then I watched it a second time and realised how great the acting was and was clueless as to why it received the meager attention it did at the time. Unforgettable performances by the young Mazzello and Wood should have made this film a classic. Although the it was probably intended to be a fantasy/drama by the original writer/director (Evans) once Donner took over he presumably made it with a more dramatical outlook especially the ending which left a lot to be desired as to what really happened to Bobby - Was he killed? did he escape & really do all those fantastic journeys? or was it just an imaginary story woven by Hanks to prove a point to the kids? But in all it didn't provide the closure of a happy ending that we are so used to in a children's film. Perhaps it's because it's not just that. To see what may have been a more classical ending check out the Official Elijah Wood Site where you'll find the First rough draft script of the conclusion of the movie(presumably by the original writer) Also a note of the music by Hans Zimmer which is one the best Soundtracks I've ever heard a mixture of childish and dark sentiments throughout the movie. A great CD to get hold of if you can. ,positive
 Having seen 'only' about 200 Hong Kong films in my time I have to say this film is among my very top favorites. Not only is the plot engaging (and in some ways surprising which these days is rare for any movie) but the chemistry between the two lead actors is superb. Top notch casting! And while often even the most serious HK films tend to insert quite a bit of humor in between all the drama and action often spoiling the mood a bit here the jokes are kept subtle and woven into the plot even improving character relations. The music is also very well done and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of the HK special Edition they've even cleaned the picture (first release was grainy) and the subtitles even if the quality of the translation is still lacking (nothing new there). All in all if you have to see a HK film that isn't directed by John Woo or have Chow Yun Fat in it this should be at least on your short list! A truly fascinating and entertaining watch! ,positive
 This film held my interest from the beginning to the very end with plenty of laughs and real down to earth acting by the entire cast. Glynn Turman (Preach Jackson) is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girl friend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Cochise Morris) was an outstanding athlete at the Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship to a famous college. There are scenes in this picture with the Chicago Police Department chasing all these dudes in a Cadillac and a visit to the Lincoln Park Zoo with monkey dung being thrown around. The music is outstanding and there is great photography around the City of Chicago. Great Film enjoy. ,positive
 I saw Fame when it first came out. It deals with the high school class of 1980 which was coincidentally my year of graduation. I saw the movie in the summer between high school and college and being a performer myself it holds a special place in my heart. The biggest criticisms of Fame usually have to do with continuity and there are definitely some story lines that either are not completed or don't make sense. However those problems are more than made up for by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music. I saw it again recently and was surprised that I still loved it as much as I did the first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance which I don't think is fair. Although Flashdance has some great music and Jennifer Beals is gorgeous I think Fame is vastly superior in the development of its characters and the complexity of its stories. For anyone who truly loves the arts this is a must-see movie. ,positive
 Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular the way Candice pronounces the words Puerto Rican is very funny as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie called Old Acquaintance starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along so because the movie is about female friendship that might have been a problem. Here the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent in particular Bochner who never got many decent parts in movies as far as I am concerned. George Cukor did not make another movie after this so this was a good one to go out on. ,positive
 That's what I thought when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies. That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed what he's capable of. Now thanks to QT he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is. By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English. Now I could repeat what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally QT is back. ,positive
 I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked Batman forever back then but the real difference is that THIS movie didn't date when I grew up. I did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'Hhmm... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get those tomatoes from?' Then I thought: 'who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway!' The original Tim Burton Batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and I didn't like all the actors. This movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast a more Gothic style and no involvement of Prince. Nowadays many fans of the Christopher Nolan movies dislike Burton claiming that the Nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. I don't think this is entirely true: -There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with Batman & Robin). A director is free to choose what kind of Batman he's going to portray as long if it's good. My opinion: Batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea. I just recently watched the Nolan movies and I love those ones as well (especially The Dark Knight). There's simply something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of Batman. That's a bit too much for me I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere. My conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the Nolan with the Burton movies. They're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect is for both directors. ,positive
 Have just seen the last episode No 32 (though the site says only 30 episodes were made) and I must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime/cop stories. Supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes this has at times been a gritty well acted believable and dare I say entertaining series. The fact that the powers in Denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least never failed to get their man ! It's a definite 10/10 for me. ,positive
 Brilliant and moving performances by Tom Courtenay and Peter Finch. ,positive
 This is halfway to being a top movie. The opening section which spoofs Hollywood social message films is absolutely brilliant. It is a riot from start to finish. The second section which introduces us to the main characters of the story is really great too. We get a lot of great comic setups top notch performances and the dialog is really dynamic. (Spoiler warning!) The one think that really annoyed me about this film though is the ending which I think contradicts everything that went before. My interpretation was that this film was taking the mickey out all the silly prejudices and innuendo of small town gossip and national tabloid sensationalism. I loved that the film was championing the cause that a person's sexuality is NOT determined by their hobbies idiosyncrasies fashion sense or whatever. And then the ending goes and re-enforces all the gossip and stereotypes that the movie successfully lampooned in the first place. It turns out everyone was 100% right!!! (godamit!) This was very disappointing to what was actually a great story. ,positive
 This show is actually pretty good. Like all shows on TV it has its good episodes and its bad ones. I have read where people compare this show to Married with Children and I suppose it is a similar show for the new generation. However because of what was expected and allowed on TV in the days of Married with Children that show was taken to great extremes to show that it was in fact a television show and not meant to be take seriously. The War at Home has the luxury of being a bit more realistic. The parents talk to each other like real life parents often do telling their children one thing when they will turn around and do the opposite. Sure some of the content can be considered controversial. But I find this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not there are a lot of families out there just like this one. Every episode does teach a 'valuable lesson'. Its just that sometimes the lesson is that you will not find a perfect solution for every problem that a family may encounter and sometimes the solution is to pick the lesser of two evils. We all know that in some cases as a parent the only goal you can have is to keep your kids out of really big trouble and hope that they learn right from wrong. I respect the writers for attempting to keep the show true to life instead of having some magical ending like the Cleaver family always had. ,positive
 I have seen this movie maybe a 100 times never grow tired of it.I saw this movie the first time when i was 7 years old and it has left a mark in my memories since then. Its a enchanting love story that brings the sun out in most people even in the darkest times. I think that this is a must see movie and one of Anthony Quinn's best performance ever. I just wish that the TV-channels would send this movie more often. It has inspired me in a good way and surly will do that to many others. If there is any actor i wanted to meet it would have been Anthony Quinn. There will never be a like of him on the silver screens ever. Wish that Anthony Quinn was still alive. May god bless his soul. ,positive
 I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell has made a damn funny movie! I don't want to give anything away but when the film turns and gets wacky it gets really wacky. Just one funny scene after another. My hats of to Mr. Campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A which was a treat. A lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame but Bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic. He was great! Anyway loved the film. I'll be looking forward to seeing this on DVD later this year. B sure to check it out on the Sci-Fi channel this fall. I highly recommend this one. ,positive
 I have been an avid chipmunk fan since the late 70's - early 80's. When this movie came out it was a must to see it. And after seeing it I went right over and bought it! The movie is great I love the animated action it brings and the music is great (yes I bought the soundtrack on CD...) A recommended video for everyone to watch and enjoy! ,positive
 An incredible performance! This is one of the best films i have seen ever. I know this is being said a lot but i bet you will not regret watching this film. It's great from the very beginning to the last second. The acting (of especially the mother - played by Judith Light) is so convincing there are not many other films i've seen that could compare to it and it seems it's impossible not to feel anything for the people in this drama. There are lots and lots of movies made every year but if you have to choose just to see a few in your life - make this one of them. ,positive
 I thought this movie was awesome and the two guys nick and aaron are hotties!!!!! I wish i could watch it over and over. I loved the plot and whole concept of the movie. It is great and I wish i had taped it last night.Nick I love You!!!!!! ,positive
 Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi this film doesn't quite reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy. The author of the original book Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman Emmanuelle Arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young Annie Belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations. Her boyfriend played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married! Orso Maria Guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by Arsan herself. Despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye? ... I can see you better naked! the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less-than-spectacular finale. Much like D'Amato's EMANUELLE AND THE LAST CANNIBALS the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but don't get your hopes up there's no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter. Just a lot of nudity and silly dialog. I couldn't help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by. ,positive
 As far as I am concerned this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is Paris France; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog. Both make this movie a bit unique at least to English-speaking film noir fans. Actually an American Jules Dussain shot the film so it's not entirely a European film. Initially I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However once that silent segment started - the actual heist (you already know what's it about) the film picked up considerably and just got better and better. In fact I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist. The best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography. This is what makes the disc worth owning. It's excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen Paris...and this is Paris in the mid 1950s. There are lots of bleak-but-interesting rain-soaked Paris streets and buildings I found fascinating to view. In fact there were many more of those great shots than of London in the much better known film The Third Man. The lead actor in here Jean Servais I think his name is also is interesting to view. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton and that sums it up perfectly. A warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film. This is France not the United States so there is a little bit of both in here. I appreciate the DVD offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version too. ,positive
 Ok so there's always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because they're good but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be or whether they're from a foreign country. All that aside One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be. The jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la Bobcat Goldthwait) surreal (Bobcat under the inspired direction of Steve Holland) and dry (John Cusack one of the most morosely dry and funny actors in American cinema) and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line (ok except Demi Moore). Yes it's immature yes it's screw-ball yes Bobcat dresses up like Godzilla and trashes a scale-model of a seafood restaurant. It's also funny as hell. Watch it. ,positive
 michael jackson is the greatest singer and the greatest dancer that ever lived and this film proves it. It is brilliant to watch and the dance is fantastic. when michael turns into a werewolf is a bit of an on the-edge-of-your-seat part the first time you watch it. and vincent price's rap adds to the fear when all the zombies a rising from their graves. if you like this then i suggest you buy 'Making Michael Jackson's Thriller' which has the film then the making of it after it. the making shows an unbelievable performance of 'Billie Jean' by michael which is when he first did on television the moonwalk. watch it. ,positive
 I've rented this gem several times! It's a small yet somehow sprawling masterpiece taking the viewer from Manhattan glitz to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cassavetes on-screen marriage to his real-life wife Gena Rowlands is on the rocks. He finds meaning in a fling with footloose Susan Sarandon whom he finds in Greece while their daughter played in her earliest film role by the pubescent Molly Ringwald falls for the son of the Greek shipping tycoon who is courting her mother on a yacht sailing in neighboring waters. Meanwhile the immensely talented Raul Julia plays a goatherd living in a cave with his Sony Trinitron. He has the hots for Molly Ringwald's character until confronted by John Cassavetes. All comes together at the end in a classic closing scene where all is reconciled. Raul Julia the goatherd is seen dancing with his goat. This film is full of mysticism beauty young and old love humor sexiness and more. See it! ,positive
 I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition. We loved everything about it: the time the romance the battle scenes the villains etc. Come on who can resist hating that psycho Bent with his constant SIR!? Classic! Moreover who can resist cheering wildly when Justin falls off the balcony?! What a triumphant moment! I always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme song alone can get me to tear up a little. This movie is incredibly moving and I challenge anyone to stick with it until the very end. It's worth it!! ,positive
 My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli production company was when an English-dubbed version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago. What a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was! So on that note I managed to get my movie theatre-employed friend to see this new film of Miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things Disney (this movie's U.S. distributor). Once again all I can say is Wow! What awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the ocean...and what about the title character's transformation from a goldfish to...and seeing how some characters' demeanor changes...and well watch this movie if you want to know what I'm talking about. Oh and the voices being used for this American-dubbed version: Tina Fey Betty White Liam Neeson Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. Good choices all. Does everything make sense? No but that's part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout. There's plenty of funny scenes concerning Ponyo and the boy and many other people they encounter. Oh I think I've written too much so I'll just highly recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo. ,positive
 I'm usually disappointed by what the media dubs lesbian movies these days: murderous bisexuals; psychotic murderous lesbians; women who experiment with other women but end up with men at the end; ridiculously good-looking women who only get w/ each other to turn men on etc. Thankfully FINGERSMITH is on a very high pedestal above this garbage. It is a credible love story acted MARVELOUSLY by every cast member down to the least of the supporting actors. Aside from having a very engaging central conflict the romance between the heroines is well developed and believable thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. I have also seen TIPPING THE VELVET but FINGERSMITH is far superior to the former both in character/conflict development and the quality of the acting. FINGERSMITH is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch offering lesbians everywhere a great follow-up act to BOUND. ,positive
 This is definitely Nolan's most intimite and thought-provoking piece. Not to say that Memento or Insomnia are bad but they were definitely up to more Hollywood standards...while Following is more of an indie flick. The story is very brilliant and very well developed. Overall...watch this if your a fan of any of Nolan's work I'm sure you'll be able to appreciate it more. ,positive
 David Tennant and Sarah Parish's brilliant acting had me in tears as many of the scenes were so familiar to me. My husband suffered a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage in 1977 and required a major operation which involved lifting his brain and plugging the leak. Like Tricia I was naive enough to expect that he would return to being his former self. After over 25 years of loving and caring for him he abandoned me without warning to go and live with a woman he hardly knew. He then petitioned for and I am now going through a divorce. I do hope the programme helped people to understand what it is like to cope with brain injury. ,positive
 George Hilton never really grabs me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood but this is a great outing for him. Basically rippin off the Django/man With No Name and doing a damn good job. The opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch. Fans of the genre will be in heaven. ,positive
 E. Elias Merhige's existentialist experiment in the enduring is definitely one hell of a boring watch. This is like something Alexander de Large was forced to watch in A Clockwork Orange. But despite just how unwatchable this film really is it is a success. If you are reading this and have not already seen the film then it is too late. For me at least the payoff (after 3 separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you) was seeing the list of characters *after* the story was told. That's when the simple message hit home. But i wonder if Merhige could have told a 5 minutes story in about 30 instead of 78. However seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed prominently on the front page for this movie the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early 20th century. Even then you might puke. 4/10 (but i commend Merhige for crafted a piece of art even if it is unwatchable) ,positive
 From start to finish this 1926 classic two reeler from the Hal Roach Studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20's. It stars the now forgotten comic genius Charley Chase and was directed by the legendary Leo McCarey who was unknown then but would earn his keep with Roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30's and 40's. Recently released onto video and disc this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages. Although today his star has virtually diminished Charley Chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents. He helped the careers of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they were brought together as a team Leo McCarey and a host of other talents. It is a shame that he is all but remembered today. Check out this little gem of a film. Once you do you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic. He had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive. Rediscover this lost giant of a film from a bygone era and its giant star. ,positive
 The idea of young girl who gets pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new to the drama genre. But it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre. There is this basic plot of Lorelai and Rory mother and daughter. Lorelai comes from a wealthy background got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents' house at 17. But this series does not start there it starts when Rory is 16 and everything is just about the problems of a single mother who has terrible problems with her parents and about all those problems you have when you are 16. Okay now again this sounds pretty normal but there is this little thing called joke. The Gilmore Girls talk incredibly fast and they make like 60 jokes a minute. Even if you don't understand all of the jokes since they contain hundreds of references to films music gossip history literature and politics. Sometimes you even get confused but that really is the fun. And not only it is fast it's smart and wonderfully sarcastic. In addition to that it is not only funny it has great drama parts in it and you can take some lessons from it even home. Which is a thing that does not go for every single TV- Series. So watch it! It'll lighten your mood and help you through hard decisions! ,positive
 Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall. It scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) they must stay longer. Kitty becomes more worried about Gerald after she tries to go in the maze but Gerald catches her and is even meaner to her. Kitty then sends for reinforcements she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide. Then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friends(who don't really do anything). Blah blah blah Kitty and her aunt end up in the maze where the most suspense of the story is. They somehow get separated and they try to find each other. But the aunt stumbles upon the creature...here it is the moment we've all been waiting for what is the creature lurking in the shadows?...it is a giant FROG!!! OMG what is better than that! After seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs oops I mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle. The frog then leaps out an open window. We then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog gall towards us (oh yeah this movie was in 3-D). But you want to know what is funny is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is 1/10 the size of the frog before it takes the leap. It is then revealed that this was all evolutions fault blah blah and Kitty and Gerald get married. Then the last shot of this masterpiece is of the grave of the frog in the maze the only place where he was ever really happy ;). ,positive
 With its rerelease by ADV Films I've had a chance to watch The Giant Majin for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night Horror Chiller Theaters. Guess what? It's a pretty damn good movie! The sets are authentic the acting in subdued and believable and the giant Majin is stately powerful and unstopable. I loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood luck charm etc) and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'. This movie is begging for a remake in the new century! ,positive
 I was just lucky I found this movie. I've been taking advantage of Walmart's $5.50 DVDs because I watch a lot of movies (and very seldom watch television). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I've seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there. I wish more people would see this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war. The story felt realistic - it isn't mushy but made me feel what they were going through. I think it helped that Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez were playing father and son - it made their relationship more believable  ,positive
 I enjoyed Erkan & Stefan  a cool and fast story which didn't get bogged down in detail. Those two guys are great to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time. The high quality of picture and cut support the movie a lot. Erkan & Stefan show that the German film industry is capable of transferring successful Hollywood concepts with local `satire' into our cinemas. ,positive
 Anywhere But Here is not exactly anything new but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching. Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills California in search of a better life. The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie would much rather have stayed in Wisconsin with all of her friends and family and she felt that she was forced to go to California with her overbearing mother. (spoilers) While it's true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new. Anywhere But Here doesn't cover any new ground but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again. Also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years seen on Natalie Portman's face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance. Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about Natalie's mother pressing her to become an actress as well as a very convincing performance from Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's very close cousins from back home. His death is a tragic cliché almost always seen in movies like this one but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this. Not great but Anywhere But Here is definitely worth a look. ,positive
 Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully. One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good. I feel that I now know more about marriage...about women. Definitely check this out it'll make you think - exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do. ,positive
 Up front if you're tired the first hour could be slow. The set up of the story has a natural leisurely pace unhurried - giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations the main characters are in. Once you arrived at the climatic segment of the storyline the turn of events will keep you hooked: how will things turn out what will happen to our precious Fanda (portrayed to utter quiet perfection by the veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský) how will his wife (wonderfully played by Stella Zázvorková) treat him what happens to Fanda's dear friend Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka - a matching sidekick to Brodský) and Jára the son with selfish hidden agenda blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!) Vladimír Michálek sensibly directed the film with sprinkles of humor preserving the insightful script by Jirí Hubac. Thanks to clear subtitling I was able to notice for every 'complaining' phrase Fanda's wife utters there's a hint of 'caringness' showing/buried in between the lines - and so did the judicious lady judge observed. Fanda is '76 going on 80' and the affection of their enduring (endearing) marriage manifests even in their bantering arguments. His playfulness can be infectious. This is 'Growing Old Together 101' for (at least) the beyond fifties and lessons learned to sons and daughters not to take parents for granted. One may need to rethink if assuming 'home for the aged' is a means to an end so to speak. The film is gently shouting to us to live life to the fullest while we can. (Hint: there's joy in staying on and watch the end credits roll.) We're fortunate to be able to see an occasional Czech film. The Sverák ( Kolya ) father & son's 2001 Dark Blue World was revealing with pathos. It's good to take it slow now and then and appreciate a foreign gem - its subtitles scenery melodic score and an engaging human story with elegant performances. Autumn Spring (aka Babí Léto) is available on DVD. Enjoy! ,positive
 In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show get inside the characters become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing but it still works. Watch a series or two of the show first before you watch this. You'll not be disappointed. Good episode to watch is No Spring for Frazer  ,positive
 I haven't seen every single movie that Burt Reynolds has ever made but this one (which I've just finished watching for the third time) may very well be his best! It suffers only from some slow stretches; Burt perhaps tried to make it more arty than it should have been. On the other hand he managed to avoid many of the usual cliches in the presentation of the tough cop role he plays (notice for example the scene in which he attempts to kiss Rachel Ward for the first time or the fear he expresses just before the final showdown with the indestructible Henry Silva). In fact Silva and those two ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains of cop thrillers of the 80s. The film also has some offbeat touches a surprising amount of humor a brutal and gripping fistfight and many well-directed shots. (***) ,positive
 Saratoga Trunk is a 1945 film starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It's based on a 1941 book by the great Edna Ferber. Subconsciously she may have had Gone with the Wind on the brain; parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. Set in the 1890s Clio Dulaine is an illegitimate child who returns from New Orleans from France with a mulatto servant (Flora Robson) and a dwarf servant Cupidon (Jerry Austin). She has given herself a Countess title and claims to be a widow. Her mother killed her father by accident and his family shunned her. Clio takes over the old homestead with the idea of embarrassing her half-sister and the wife of her father which she does by calling great attention to herself. Her plan is to marry someone very wealthy who can give her the security and respectability she craves. Then she spots Clint Maroon (Cooper) a Texas gambler and falls for him. The two have a volatile relationship - and he doesn't have any money so she can't marry him - so he leaves for Saratoga Springs. Eventually the Dulaine family has enough and their attorney gives her $10 000 to get out of town. She does. She goes to Saratoga Springs and goes after the owner of the railroad Bart von Steed. But Clint is always around. Bergman is beautiful in dark hair and wearing the period costumes and Cooper is drop-dead gorgeous with that incredible 300-watt smile of his. How she could resist him is beyond me. And the love scenes - whoa what chemistry! The supporting cast is excellent Robson and Cupidon creating interesting characters and Florence Bates giving an excellent performance as a socially prominent woman who takes Clio under her wing knowing she's a big fake. The film runs a little long and some of the acting may seem old-fashioned today but it's an absorbing story filled with atmosphere and vivid performances. The ending won't come as any surprise. It's a fun journey though. ,positive
 A beautiful woman a backwoods inbred monster man a super sweet monster truck a road kill zombie brother and 2 friends...one anal retentive overly sensitive nerd and the other a foul mouthed adolescent slob. Throw them all together with a dash of Jeepers Creepers Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Road Trip and you've got Monster Man. A hilarious horror/comedy outing that never sets out to say something . It's a simple straight forward laugh fest. Unpretentious and well made this horror/comedy is at its heart a buddy flick. This film offered some hilarious and sickening set pieces. I highly recommend this to fright fans looking to be entertained. ,positive
 Murder Over New York is fun but not as good as most of the other Fox Chans. This film would have been better named Charlie Chan in New York the film's working title. This is Toler's chance to play Chan in the Big Apple. There is a lot to like here though including guest star Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges. This has one of my favorite Chan sayings Coincidence like ancient egg--leave unpleasant odour. Toler and Yung are good in this one and so is the supporting cast. But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere which I look for in these films. Still it is good to see. ,positive
 Pretty amusing spoof with great attention to detail re: the look of the 1960s spy films and the way the action was staged back then. The fight sequence in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a Peter Lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. A big plus: Jean Dujardin is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight. Plus his eyebrows deserve some sort of recognition for doing a great job. Funny aside: the people behind me in the theater kept gasping after every plot twist as if they were watching a 'real' spy thriller. Before the movie started a trailer for Get Smart was screened. The preview made the movie look embarrassingly bad with lame attempts to incorporate the jokes and gags from the TV series. Looks like a bomb and quite a contrast to the comparatively sublime jokes and gags of OSS 117 though of course OSS had its share of misfires. The overall tone of OSS however was not an insult to the audience's intelligence and the material didn't feel as it had been 'dumbed down.' I did get the distinct impression that if I understood the language I would have caught more of the jokes and one in particular (the pistol gag) was mishandled in the interpretation for the subtitles. ,positive
 I wonder how many MINI Cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie? It couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car which is featured in this film along with an attractive cast. This is a very very entertaining heist-and-chase film. It features a cool cast with Mark Wahlberg Charlize Theron Edward Norton Seth Green and Jason Statham. The best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in Venice Italy. The film doesn't overdo the violence has a pretty intelligent script (with a few short exceptions). features interesting characters and is nicely firmed. The cat-and-mouse game between Norton and Theron's characters is suspenseful and fun to watch. Once again however we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as the good guys. How many times has this happened since the days of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in the 1960s? It's twisted Hollywood for you. In here one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang so he's the worst of the bunch and the film's villain. Also Theron's character is in the typically overblown-feminist mode of Hollywood in which women can do all things (including driving a car) better than a man. A third minor irritation is Seth Green's smug smart-ass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because it's hip and cool. Despite these hindrances it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex....and yes those little cars are cool. Everyone I've talked to who has seen this film enjoyed it. ,positive
 Sometimes a movie is so bad it's kind of good. This movie was made in Germany and is dubbed in English so you have to get past that. The acting also was stilted and forced other than what was done by the real rats who IMO did an excellent job of acting the part. Snaps to the rat wrangler. Anyway the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and the local garbage collectors go on strike as a result thus leaving large piles of trash everywhere. This storyline has been used before not to mention has happened in real life (too often unfortunately) and the audience is not in for any surprises. But this is fine. We know what's going to happen and when and sometimes an audience needs a movie where a lot of brain cells are not necessary to follow along. We have our hero down to the chiseled face and body the semi-hero(s) and of course our heroine who happens to be the doctor but only still in training though it is she who discovers what really is going on when so many people end up sick and dying and not just from a rat bite. Of course the villain must die (okay all the villains meaning the rats) and the ending scene is one of those that reminds the audience that a sequel is in the works. This is one of those movies that you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it is not. ,positive
 I Love Ernest Goes to Jail. It's one of my top 3 favorite Ernest movies. The others being Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest Goes to Camp. In this movie Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a janitor for a bank but he wants to be a bank clerk. Soon he is assigned jury duty but soon winds up in trouble when the evil murderer Felix Nash (Varney also) knocks him out and switches places with him! Soon Ernest is in jail and is forced to act like Nash or else Nash will kill Charlotte Ernest's love interest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair thinking he's Nash he gets so electrocuted he winds up breaking out and goes off and saves Charlotte from the evil Nash! Filled with hilarious scenes and comics Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that'll make you laugh so hard! It still does to me! Jim Varney was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both good guy and bad guy! Varney was like his Toy Story Co star Tom Hanks. No matter what role they played their roles were memorabilia and that's one of the things that Varney's gonna be remembered forever for! R.I.P. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing Ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10! ,positive
 Wesley Eure is young inventor Brian Foster who's invented a new crime busting security device in the form of a robot dog the titular C.H.O.M.P.S. (It stands for Canine HOMe Protection System). C.H.O.M.P.S. who's been modeled after Brian's real dog Rascal can do just about anything; he's got enhanced speed strength X-ray vision and the like. It's just the thing to save his boss Ralph Norton's (Conrad Bain) security company. Naturally a slimy competitor Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants the edge so he tries to get his hands on the secret. This is the kind of thing that's just too hard to resist. It's got plenty of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of bumbling idiots) an upbeat attitude an engaging cast and enough good laughs to keep one entertained. The energetic disco-style music gets repetitive but is undeniably catchy; the story is straightforward and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In one thoroughly odd but side-splitting touch there's another dog in the film (named Monster ) whose thoughts we actually get to hear; both his dialog and the performer doing the voice are priceless. In fact he even utilizes some mild profanity and his last words end the film on a positively gut busting final note. Eure and the cute Valerie Bertinelli are very likable young leads and their veteran supporting cast plays the material with all the gusto they can muster. Larry Bishop Hermione Baddeley Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey also co-star. A rare theatrical live-action venture for the cartoon-creating team of Hanna & Barbera ('The Flintstones' 'Scooby-Doo' 'The Smurfs' and so on) C.H.O.M.P.S. is agreeably silly stuff. I know it left me with a smile on my face. 7/10 ,positive
 A savage undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival. He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it. At first he thinks Bugs Bunny's home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes Bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground there he meets with Bugs his next trainer. If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on you should watch this cartoon. Director Bob McKimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour. The signature scenes include: 1/ the look of Bugs Bunny's home cross-referencing to Donald Duck with the B.B. name acronym on the headboard of Bugs's bed 2/ Bugs Bunny's short journey with the mine hoist climbing up to the ground floor 3/ When Nero the Lion calls his friend the Elephant for help Bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the Elephant; since the Elephant needed a broom to outpower that toy mouse he uses Nero as a broom! 4/ Bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make-up and the practical clown jokes that he makes 5/ the trapeze scene while Nero chasing after Bugs 6/ the famous Human Cannonball scene after which Nero the Lion starts dancing Hawaiian Hula The magic moments which keep Acrobatty Bunny fresh at all times in our memory: 1/ When Bugs comes out of his bunny hole he thinks he's in the Pinocchio tale; and starts acting to save Pinocchio out of the giant whale's stomach 2/ When the Lion roars to scare him Bugs replies back to him with roaring 3/ Bugs arguing with the Lion for he's making so much noise then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than him 4/ Wearing rubber heels at the circus Bugs starts to bounce like toy rabbits and causes Nero to bounce! Those are the 10 main reasons that keeps Acrobatty Bunny as a Bugs Bunny classic and can be found in the Bugs Bunny Classics' MGM/UA Video (1989)  ,positive
 An unusual movie which starts off with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him in order to escape the country. But a twist soon turns the tale upside down. Most of the film hits the right buttons: the story develops smoothly acting is solid (Sienna Miller's drawl is priceless she really can act!) chemistry between both leads works and rolling American rural scapes and quirky side characters really make for a good time. The mood which starts off as light and romantic soon moves into something darker and downright eery at times. At times though the pace slows just a tad more than we would like but don't let this stop you watching this unusual little cinematic treat. Alexandre Montin Paris ,positive
 Totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it. This movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way. What it is about? Estrangement I believe. Probably up to the viewer but I found that this movie tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and perfect facades. Don't know if I'm right. But this movie really got to me. See it. I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style. And I forgot: The Casting here i superb with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why. The acknowledgment of not understanding the purpose of life (in the city) is what makes him bothersome. All the others do as they are told and pretend (?) to be happy. This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006. ,positive
 LCDR Tom Dodge despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader: Maverick does not mean Tom Cruise . Maverick means non-conformist .) is actually an intelligence operative for the Vice Admiral of his submarine fleet. The Vice-Admiral is concerned about our old friends the Russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Lybia North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into Norfolk Harbour or Mayport Florida. And this was 6-7 years before 9/11. The Admiral assigns Dodge to assume command of a moth-balled WWII diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO a top of the line fast attack sub. Dodge takes command and in no time whips up the bad news bears.. err I mean his lovable group of oddball submariners into warriors. Despite having welcome aboard tattooed on his penis he is a competent and fair commander he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority in a responsible manner. The US NAVY could not have come up with a finer piece of recruitment propaganda than this handsomely made under-appreciated gem from the creator of Police Academy . ,positive
 Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show Fridays )plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not of course his intent he had higher aspirations but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie but it's also pretty fun. Of course once the good doctor realizes what he's done he's ashamed but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains. There's a few subplots like Jekyll's fiancée who is the daughter of the head doctor at Our Lady of Suffering and Pain Jekyll's employer. And there's Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few real parts and a taste for men and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes and who is going to make several people rich with a complete set of organ transplants including testicles. Yeah the humor is raunchy and silly and overall the whole thing is fairly tasteless but if you're not above a quick wallow in the gutter you'll probably like it just fine. Now available on DVD too for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10. ,positive
 Ocean's 12 'If you steal fifty million dollars they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber Die Hard) This adage certainly rings true in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and his compadres were the ones who ripped him off and now he wants it all back. The Ocean gang need a lot of money and fast but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to perform acts of death defying thievery whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'Night Fox' a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-type-sequence. Interesting? Well yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty. Ocean and his band of merry men are charismatic if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more 'pally' situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as ever (I really like Cheadle but could not abide this). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. However what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development versus how slick the whole damned op was. And as much as these actors work well together Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight 11 sided hole. She simply doesn't fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. The stars of this film for me however were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of locations. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he was born into both. His Night Fox is arrogant 'awfully cavalier with other people's lives' (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film loses its way. Cassel and the European locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the American actors and the style of the first film. We want slick brash and quick-witted; not gritty considered and intellectual. This is where the film doesn't work. Admittingly you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter but going to far left or right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this. ,positive
 Currently playing at the 2007 German Film Festival in Australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm thanks to Peanutqueen and especially AriesGemini for her rundown on the actors in this ensemble cast. In Australia these movies were sub-titled in English and while French movies here often get a mainstream release German movies are still to gather that sort of commercial audience. But like BMWs and Mercedes when Germans get it right I really like their films. Like PQ the time here went so quickly lots of laughs from the audience as each of the 9 men and 9 women moved down the speed dating line 5 minutes at a time. While many films are overlong this one I could have watched much more of. It had the sort of characters and character development for a series. Given time I will re-read AriesGemini100 review and reference the actors I liked and their other work with a view to keeping an eye out from them. I agree....most of these actors will go onto bigger and better things. Some very good character actors in this fine film. I did see it in the program listed as a mockumentary. Mock or otherwise it felt very real. And quite romantic in it's way. Viva la Deutcsh! ,positive
 Well on the day that Rob Schneider plunges himself further into the black hole of notoriously bad movies by starring in the absolutely not-at-all-wanted Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo (hmmmm....wasn't there a film called Roadtrip which was followed by a sequel called Eurotrip? And now there's Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo followed by sequel Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo.......I smell a pattern. Perhaps soon there will be Spiderman: European webs are Hotter.....or not) I am writing about this much maligned (at time of release) film. I was one of those maligners I must admit. I turned my nose up at it even while Chris Farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the SNL cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in '94-'95 the Norm McDonald anchorship notwithstanding. Films like Happy Gilmore Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler films. However I watched this film the other day ten years after and 8 years after Chris died and could not stop laughing. Yes it's not particularly sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny being Manny) but his Van Down By the River motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not wash enough or wear well-fitting clothes or use deodorant more than twice a week translates well here as the ever self-effacing character who realizes he's not the brightest not the best-looking and could stand to lose a few pounds. All the same he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to. And David Spade just tosses off his snide one-liners as he did for Spade's Hollywood Minute and basically stings Farley's self-esteem. There's really not a whole lot more to say than that. I love the one scene when Farley catches Spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it. Can't remember what the first one is but the second one they're lying in their hotel beds and Farley says to Spade Do you like baseball? . Spade mutters something inaudible in response and Farleys says the New York YANK-ees? Anyway Farley does his awkward painfully sensitive frat-boy shtick. If you like you like it. I couldn't stop laughing. ,positive
 I saw this on DVD with subtitles which made it a little frustrating to get through because of the film's length. But I was riveted throughout all of it. That I was fascinated by the characters and always engrossed in the story despite the subtitles is a testament to the film's power. It's an amazing piece of work. I have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time. It's easily the best foreign film I've seen in the last twenty years or so. I would like to know the full story behind the making of this film. It must have taken a very long time and required the use of hundreds of locations. Its use of some hardcore scenes (on the TV in the motel room) may unfortunately make some people choose not to see it but if you don't mind those you'll be deeply moved by all the stories in this one! ,positive
 The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons and as always George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people. ,positive
 What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons (without becoming unrealistic) manages this beautiful movie perfectly well (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'La Double Vie de Veronique' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story masterfully directed excellent main actors masterful cinematography. I've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if you should be unhappy with the ending of 'White' - 'Red' puts an happy end to the whole trilogy. ,positive
 Many years ago I saw this movie (on television maybe?) and loved it. So I decided to rent it on DVD the other day to see whether it still held up in my estimation. It did. Set in Sydney's notorious King's Cross district (where prostitution drug abuse and sex stores thrive) it tells the story of Jimmy (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man...maybe late teens or thereabouts who hasn't had a stable family background. He is on the fringes of society and works as a 'tout' for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). He is aware of an underworld figure called Pando who is a local bigwig in the Cross. It's Jimmy's hope that he will find himself on Pando's radar and get 'in' with him...a short-cut to upward social mobility he hopes. One night Jimmy meets the beautiful young woman Alex (played by the charming Rose Byrne). You just know that a love story will play out between them. On that night as well Jimmy is first contacted by Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pando has a 'job' for Jimmy. It's the 'foot in the door' that Jimmy has been waiting for! To reveal too much more would spoil the many surprises that this movie has in store for the viewer. Stylistically if you like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movies you should be in tune with what to expect...twists and turns and black comedy. What's so great about this movie is its very 'Australian-ness'. It's no mere knock off of Tarantino or Ritchie but a genuine Australian contribution to the genre. A fascinating aspect to this movie is how it all hangs together. Sometimes you are introduced to characters who you wonder what the hell they're doing there. In the end all these 'loose ends' tie together beautifully. It's sort of like a celluloid Moebius strip. A highlight of the movie is Bryan Brown's character of Pando. Pando likes puzzles and it's fun to see him play games with his cronies. It's the little details revealed about him which are so enjoyable...his taste in music for starters! Of the Heath Ledger movies I have seen (The Dark Knight 10 Things I hate about you) this is perhaps his best role. Wasn't taken with 10 things . If you are a Heath Ledger fan (Ledger recently died a tragic accidental death) this is a chance to see him in his greatest Australian role I think. There is great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this movie-so on one level it functions as nice love story. This movie doesn't have some of the horror of Tarantino and Ritchie underworld movies but it does have some adult themes...scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty. In that sense it's not an ideal movie for very young viewers but it's not a movie that gore-hounds will get excited about either. Lastly I have to say that it is great that Australia can make great movies like this. Usually the kind of movies my home country makes can be uniniviting. This movie has strengths where many Australian movies have weaknesses...i.e. it has a great story great acting and a great script. We need more popular quality movies like this to be made here in Australia. Highly recommended. Other Australian movies I have loved include: Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My Brilliant Career (not reviewed here by me yet) Proof (nr) The Devil's Playground (nr) The Year My Voice Broke (nr) Bad Boy Bubby (nr. A great dark comedy) The Dish (nr. A great charming comedy) ,positive
 At first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don't have.The first time i saw it i couldn't see it complete because i had to leave.But while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn't have any opportunity by then.One year went by until i saw this movie in a not-free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too.I saw it once twice...until 200 times and not kidding.I did know all the dialogues by hart and i don't know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored.And i have to say that I'm not used to see a movie more than twice.The act is very good.Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too.I would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it.On balance it's a movie i can't take out of my mind. ,positive
 I first saw this film in the mid 60's when I was a teenager and it moved me so much in fact the end scene where Han Suyin hears of Mark's death and then rushes to the hill in disbelief where you then hear Mark's voice saying Give Me Your Hand and then the image of him disappears the butterfly with it's superstitious meaning the music the shattered emotions of Love of Han Suyin just left me sobbing my heart out. I was outwardly crying bitterly my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction. I just left the room to be on my own. Fortunately I do not react like that any more BUT I always cry at the end. I love everything about the film the music mostly the costumes of Han Suyin and location. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the handsome William Holden they were both at their best. I have the VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of the Music & Lyrics by Arthur Newman and Sammy Fain. I also have the book A Many Splendored Thing by Han Suyin. I recommend this film 100% ,positive
 The film was apparently spawned from an idea one of the writers had when he 'saw' one of his creations in a supermarket. The inhabitants of Royston Vasey head into 'our' world to persuade the writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world. If that sounds a bit too serious don't be put off. Within the first few minutes we get: Bernice (the vile female vicar) letting rip at an unfortunate penitent during confession; Chinnery (the vet who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches) attempting to collect semen from a giraffe; Mickey (thick beyond belief) being ah thick; and Tubbs (inbred sister-wife and local shopkeeper) being sweet as ever - but still disgusting. Some of the regular characters are missing but a new idea by the Gents introduces some 16th-Century characters - and we have the Gents themselves in the action too. If you're new to The League of Gentlemen this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun. If you're a long-standing fan this has everything you've come to expect - including the joys of Jeremy Dyson spotting. All told it's got the same faintly surreal humour that's the hallmark of the series plus some moments of quite touching 'introspection'. Herr Lipp for example maintains a gentle dignity on learning that he's regarded by his creators as a 'one-joke character'. While most of the characters stay as they are some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happen. This film is a 'swan song' for Royston Vasey but it's also a showcase for the Gents who prove that (gasp!) they can write other stuff - and it can be very funny. (But you knew that anyway.) ,positive
 I was very impressed with the latest production from Mick Molloy. As a fan of his I was used to a different kind of humour than displayed here. He wisely opted with a more subtle broad style of comedy in Crackerjack rather than his usual low brow in-your-face ramblings. It is at times inconsistent and un-even but a decent script works past that and makes for some entertaining viewing. Directed by Paul Moloney (who has directed almost every Australian TV series imaginable) Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson a bloke that belongs to his local bowls club for the sole reason of parking. When the club hits financial trouble he is forced to bowl competitively in an attempt to raise the funds to save the club from becoming a poker machine haven. A familiar and successful formula that is handled well. There is no denying that the film owes it's success to the great casting of Molloy. He seemed to have a great rapport with Samuel Johnson and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy and while the character is probably not a far stretch from his own personality you can't help but wonder why he hadn't tried his arm at film earlier. To smooth out the in-experienced cast the delightful Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter support and often steal their scenes. They are two fine actors and the pair cruise through their roles with ease. Had it not been for the huge success of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' Crackerjack would have made it to number 1 at the Australian box office but when you consider what he film is about and who is involved even making it to number 2 was an outstanding effort. All in all a witty feel-good movie. Great cast great crew and a great soundtrack combine to make one of the better Australian films of 2002. 7/10. ,positive
 This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary and the acting spectacular. At first I thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie and despite this I must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been but the plot is what really gets you. American or Asain I would recommend this to anyone--and I have now. I guarantee that after seeing this one you'll get the best out of it and its plot. I hope you feel the same and write a rave review too! ,positive
 `The Last Frontier' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed (Victor Mature) Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison) Colonel Marston(Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians Jed Gus and Mungo adjust to living the `civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier.' Jed who has been raised by Gus both inspires and looks up to the `older' Gus and Mungo and has an especially difficult time dealing with `civilization.' His real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonel's wife Corrina. Colonel Marstonis a reckless man who endangers every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent. Corrina a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is. Caught in the middle is Captain Riordon a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonel's recklessness. What makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of `The Last Frontier' are EXACTLY the same elements (forget the insipid title and dated music) First the screenplay. Almost all of the subplots (particularly the reckless Colonel) have been done better elsewhere but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity. Just when you THINK you know what is going to happen next this one takes off in a DIFFERENT direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: `The Last Frontier' being a `Production Code' movie (back in the day the word `virgin' was taboo) it's very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature tolerant manner. I expected either Jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin. I was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn't exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending. Second the casting. Mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of Jed the wild-eyed innocent raised in the woods'. James Whitmore who plays Gus `the man who raised Jed' is actually five years younger than Mature. Nevertheless Mature is very endearing playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid. Although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time (most notably Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas) none could have played Jed better. Preston (also Mature's junior) plays Colonel Marston missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man. However Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in Marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel's rank. Bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as Corrina. Bancroft's dark hair has been died blonde and this achieves the same effect as it did for Winona Ryder (`Edward Scissorhands') and Christina Ricci (`Sleepy Hollow'). That is I felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why; I believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades. Further Bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness (here the blonde hair softens her up a bit though). This enables the 24 year old Bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old Mature and the 37 year old Preston; yep she could be a colonel's wife. Madison walks a careful balancing act as Riordan handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogue.Playing a role similar to that of John Wayne in `Fort Apache' Madison does a more skillful job at it. This movie has a `Silverado' type camaraderie. That alone makes it worth seeing. It also has memorable performances beautiful scenerary and great action and direction. I just hope a letterbox version is available (many have been lost) because this movie takes full advantage of that format. ,positive
 I agree with all aforementioned comments. This show was a delight to watch. Funny witty terrific acting and zany sets. It's always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. I would spend good hard-earned cash money to see it again on DVD. And as long as we're requesting Smart Series That Never Got a Chance...How about DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well written odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) And add to the list...Middle Ages or Frank's Place. There has to a way to release these shows out of the vaults and into the hands of devoted fans and new audiences. ,positive
 Just to correct something in a previous review here I don't believe this film is only for people who know London it's a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments. Jack Rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who by going though this gruelling Knowledge test gain some measure of self-knowledge. I think it's one of the most perfectly-written dramas I've seen: technically it's supremely adept at conveying quite complex details but it's also joyous in how it involves you. At the start you know no more about this London Knowledge test than the main characters but you get scooped up right along with them until it's vitally important to you. You become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed and you are crushed for those who don't. Especially one whose downfall without giving anything anyway will make your hands fly to your face. Also just as a point of fact Nigel Hawthorne's character Mr Burgess is called the Vampire not Dracula. You don't need to know this I'm not saying it's crucial but it's a measure of the drama: once you've seen this you will want everyone to and you will evangelise about its every detail. I hope you get to see it. William ,positive
 It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes us inside the trials and tribulations of a group of top American scientists handed a lofty task during the Second World War: beat everyone else to the atomic bomb. Sequestered in a heavily-guarded New Mexico compound the brainiacs slowly turn the idea from ambitious concept into immense reality. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those films that requires your close attention. It's a real thinking person's movie not only from the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon but also the moral implications of contributing to killing on a massive scale. Characters are constantly torn between that reality and their wartime duty as Americans. The film is never preachy about however leaving us free to marvel at the enormity of the inner turmoil these men face. The performances deserve special mention as well. Paul Newman delivers one of his great understated performances as the Pattonesque general in charge of delivering the ultimate big stick for the Allied Forces. Where FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY loses much of its traction is in the unnecessary romantic component. Dwight Schultz as the leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project. Director Roland Joffe apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story but the romantic overtones serve primarily as a distraction. Besides it's the interaction among the scientists and their military hierarchy that give us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men. Still it's difficult not to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. It's a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face put on one of the most intriguing stories in human history. ,positive
 Bon Voyage has the fast pace that in some ways reminds me of the Indiana Jones/Star Wars films -- it's as if you're on a fast train or roller coaster. It's billed as a romance mystery thriller and farce; it's all of that and more including candid observations on the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion at the start of WWII. And it's also an exhibition of juggling that involves 7 main characters. The scenes all seemed historically accurate (to my eyes) and gave an excellent feeling for the period. All of the actors were well cast and gave great performances but IMO the most superb was that by Isabelle Adjani who played the role of an opportunistic self-centered French movie star; not only did she quite convincingly play the role of a young actress perhaps half her age but she also played her amorous wiles convincingly yet in such a way that the audience sees she's only half serious and more complex as a person than just a gold digger. Her character and energy propel the film through from beginning to end. It wasn't until I read Roger Ebert's review that I discovered she was 48 years old at the time of the film. What beauty!! I appreciated the ending -- it's satisfying but lets you write your own conclusion as to what happens to the main characters. As another User Commenter observed -- do NOT arrive late; you need to be there from the opening scene. Good advice. I gave it 9 of 10. ,positive
 There was once someone in my family (not saying who it is because of personal reasons) who thinks that Mr Bean is always so silly in whatever he does on the comedy series. Imagine how I felt at that time. Shocked instantly. There are more reasons than one why I love watching Mr Bean. Being one of those earliest shows on the local television here in my country where I first grew up watching it's just one of those things which had stuck into my head. There was even once my friends and I talked about few of the selected episodes and we just laughed together. It's always silly funny and hilarious in whatever antics Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean will do in each episode. Though lately at times it may show some of the repeats here it never failed to bring back those childhood memories of mine. In fact I can dare say this is the very first show which introduces me about the kind of shows which come out of the UK as I was growing up. The comedy series...definitely really wicked as what the Brits may be saying. ,positive
 As a huge fan of horror I had given up on the vampire sub-genre due to the fact that in most vampire flicks the vampire has become feminine and non-threatening benign and basically weak. This was the attitude I brought to a viewing of Soul's Midnight and I am happy to say that the vampires in this film at least have the hunger to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies! Armand Assante one of my favorite actors of all time was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity. Another thing that interested me is that the central location is the Borgo Hotel. That is cool because (and I went back to my high school copy to look this up) in Dracula the Borgo Pass is where Jonathan Harker must pass to get to Dracula's castle. Finally my hats off to whoever made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a darn CGI! That's the one thing great about many low-budget movies they cannot afford the garbage computer effects that plague many Hollywood monstrosities. Bottom line...this is better than Underworld for sure especially if you are a vampire purest. Cheers JA ,positive
 The story in this movie is fairly implausible B grade stuff but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead and in 1940 that meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner Stephen Danel who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine. Upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of Danel. Only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves; Danel's wife and monkeys. Monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get. Lorre is perfect in his role here and creeps up the screen in industrial-strength fashion. Although the script is not Casablanca caliber the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very watchable story but I'm not sure what niche this movie filled. Too long for a short subject and too short for a feature length film I'm not sure how this was marketed to theaters. I just caught this for the first time on a late night/early morning TCM showing. Lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven't seen it. ,positive
 I think every critic who panned Tommy Boy when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all. Every critic panned Chris Farley and David Spade's movies. Yes Coneheads was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and Black Sheep I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made. But Tommy Boy does not fall in the category of Coneheads which could have been a little funnier and Black Sheep which is a piece of tripe. It is very funny and entertaining. I do agree with the critics that Chris Farley was no John Belushi or John Candy as he claimed to have idolized those guys and those guys had a genius for comedy but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he were around longer to prove to critics that yes he was no John Belushi or John Candy but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are side-splitting hilarious and the premise is also laugh out loud hilarious. It is very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like Tommy Boy to remember how truly funny he was. Tommy Boy is one of the 1990's best comedies. ,positive
 Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date though at just over 45 minutes in length it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills including marching and gun-slinging much to the disgust of his drill sergeant. The Tramp then finds himself in the trenches faced with a more formidable foe though the Germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he. The uproarious moment when the Tramp declares that he single-handedly captured thirteen German soldiers by surrounding them had me in stitches. There are plenty of other great moments in this film. Chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surface. However the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve Chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree. The reactions of the bumbling German soldiers unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy as they are single-handedly disabled one-by-one are highly amusing especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood. This is a very enjoyable film and one of the best of Chaplin's pre-1920 efforts. Highly recommended. ,positive
 The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should had been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') into the rivaled field of TV-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies 'Eraserhead' 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here. 'Mulholland Dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing others obviously were taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway' but it never seemed to be unfinished work. In the internet I came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. Imagine this scenario: A little child is dissecting his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. Is it because it wants to destroy his toy? Does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it. David Lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. Human desires dreams obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.Laura Elena Harring Naomi Watts Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. When you claim the criterion of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than Lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifest David Lynch's status as one of the most important creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's world of films. 'Mulholland Dr.' is more than just a sleeper  it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides the film is a pay-off with Hollywood in form and content which in that distinctness was hardly dared before. ,positive
 This Columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites. The cast includes Rosemary's Baby John Cassavetes as the maestro his wife played by Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mom) and his mother-in-law played by Myrna Loy (one of America's greatest leading actresses in film of our time). Anyway I disagree with anybody who criticizes against this film. This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a superb job in performing. I love watching Columbo with his beloved dog who he never names in the series. This time the episode focuses in on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl one of L.A.'s attractions. Of course Columbo becomes as interested in classical music as he does anything else involving a crime. ,positive
 I have a letter from Ms. Knight who went to college with my older sister. In it she tells of the hardships of making this film. She herself was pregnant--an interesting conjunction with the movie's plot--and the novice director was unsure fairly green and having great difficulties with all the decisions logistics etc. They were on the move all the time and it was a very difficult shoot. The film however with a strong debut for James Caan remains effective and affecting. It's a great showcase for the talent that Ms. Knight has demonstrated her entire career--on television in movies and on the stage where she won the Tony for Kennedy's Children. This film has aged well. ,positive
 I have been a huge Errol Morris fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a life. To date this movie is his best piece of work. The plot is a mixing of Stephen Hawking's Book of the same title intertwined with the man's life. The story is told through interviews with family friends and Hawkings himself. Don't be fooled; It totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking. The blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining. I was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man. Tho physically powerless Hawking's greatness and shear brilliance is encapsulated into a real live human being that we are allowed to laugh at and aw over at the same time. Find this movie. Watch it and enjoy. And if the studio who owns this picture reads this A 15 year Anniversary edition would be perfect NOW... ,positive
 Philippe Garrel makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague almost lost among the vestiges of its ancient splendor but ready to rise again from its ashes if recalled from the past. They who are a little acquainted with the director's subjects on the other hand may know very well how he's obsessed by a lingering sense of loss as far as fickleness of reality is concerned. Les amants réguliers therefore show us the parallel stories of an amour fou and of a tempted revolution gone to ruin under the direction of young French students. The first part of the story is about the dramatic events of May '68 in France evoked in a series of astonishing plan-sequences a sort of cinema verité style that place the student insurrection in anything but an enviable light against a pitch-black background. There's much that can be said about the peculiarities of black-and-white photography used to describe the battle between students and police where the high contrasts confer an unrealistic atmosphere to the sequences and darkness closes in upon the excited bodies wrapping them in mystery. The images completely deprived of words show the real consistence of the myth made of crude violence more and more emphasized by the exasperated reality of the movie shootings. The individual doesn't count anything at all here: he tends to disappear in the mass. What really matters in these fight scenes are the significance of the mass-suggestion the blind fury of the juvenile assault sinister eulogies of the power of the mob even if conceived like separate entities apart from any kind of emotion with the cold and distant look of an entomologist intent to catalog his insect collection. The second part of the story is described in a quieter and most intimate way. Stands out on the horizon the distressing portrait of a self-centered generation in search of its lost time completely disenchanted about the individual values of men inclined to rotate on its own axis between opium fumes and making a funeral oration in the praise of its recent defeat. Les amants réguliers seems to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great Robert Bresson revised and corrected by Garrel's particular sensibility without drifting away from the main argument trying to expand overall perspectives on the subject of human disillusions that though painful may bring us to the truth. In my opinion trying to penetrate deeply into the substrate of the story if a man lets himself go and play things by ear he probably will find that he can bring out the dark side of his self with dire and irretrievable consequences. ,positive
 While not for everyone Crackerjack is a delight to watch with tongue planted firmly in cheek. The likeable character of Jack Simpson played by Mick Molloy is scamming the local bowlo for free parking and making a couple of dollars on the side selling the parking space to work colleagues. When the Bowling Club members need to raise some money to save their club they call upon Jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls. Filled with Aussie Charm the laconic wit of Mick Molloy is showing through (he also co-wrote the script) reminding this viewer of his earlier work in Radio. Perfect Aussie casting with Bill Hunter as Jack's bowling mentor Stan Coombes John Clarke (of The Games fame) as the ruthless businessman and rival bowls club owner Bernie Fowler with Samuel Johnson as Jack's flatmate Dave and Judith Lucy as the jaded Journalist Nancy. Initially I figured only fans of Molloy would like this flick but judging by the number of the blue rinse set exiting the cinema chuckling this is a film for everyone. ,positive
 Even if you're a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. For once there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight ! True to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely. Yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity. Jean-Claude Couty's atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and Philippe Bréjean (a/k/a Gary Sandeur ) contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore. Shot in and around a Paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars Rollin was already quite familiar with from his Michel Gentil cash-gathering XXX efforts most notably French f*ck film royalty Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding lead. Playing Elisabeth (rather well I might add) she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by Robert (Vincent Gardère) driving home at the end of a long work day. Barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there Elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting Robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment. Prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin (further credit to Brigitte's thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s) because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his. Because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes Rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding. When Robert leaves for work he's inevitably erased from Elisabeth's feeble mind. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau effectively cast against type) and his menacing assistant Solange (striking porn starlet Rachel Mhas) move in on her during her protector's absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from. Here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re-introduced to her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner a/k/a hardcore performer Cathy Stewart in a quietly devastating turn) both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate. That deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and Catherine's unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It's also Catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges Elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them. Several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movie's mid-section and French porn aficionados should recognize the likes of Alain Plumey (a/k/a Cyril Val ) Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess Marilyn Jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of Plumey was only present in the film's rarely screened XXX version FILLES TRAQUEES. The pivotal part of Véronique a girl Elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite Dominique Journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in Franco Zeffirelli's LA TRAVIATA. The six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace. The final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded Robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each other's outstretched hands. ,positive
 I enjoyed this show it was on in the uk but not at peak time and they seemed to move it all over the schedules so I wasn't able to watch them all. I was surprised when it didn't return and had no i idea why still don't know but i guess that's not important. Great performances from the two leads they were very believable as friends. The two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. I guess it was part of a whole load of shows that were lifestyle centred Friends being the obvious main one but sex in the city came along a few years later. The characters get take out coffee they drink at nice bars that sort of thing a little woody allenish in a way. ,positive
 in a time of predictable movies in which abound violence cheap romance and melodrama it is delightfully surprising to find such a strange movie. the plot itself is compelling and the actors are excellent especially Alan Rickman. If you want to watch a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking the questions a movie that will surprise you (in good or bad) Dark Harbor's for you. And if you're not convinced believe me that Alan Rickman's performance is well worth it... especially at the end ladies.... ,positive
 i think the title of the movie describes it well. if you are looking for a documentary on louis kahn and his work you'll have to look somewhere else. although some of that is covered in this film. of course i eat up pretty much anything i'm fed and i don't know much of the family history revolving around this case. so i believed what i was told about nathaniel and his father etc. for what this movie was i thought it was pretty good. a little slow and grabbing for attention at time i wish that nathaniel would have focused a little more on his father's work than his family drama (although much of the history was interesting louis was a bit of a player). this really is a journey through someone's life and i was happy to tag along for the experience. a learning experience for me and so it seems for the filmmaker as well. oh and the footage of some of kahn's work is *stunning* ,positive
 Haggard: The Movie is well written well directed and well acted. There are many laugh out loud moments and some terrific skateboarding scenes featuring Margera. The scenes of West Chester PA are filmed beautifully and the script is just downright funny. What I like about the movie is that instead of being another sappy love story or another version of Jackass it takes a darkly funny look at break-ups from a different perspective. Most break-up films feature a naive woman jilted by a cheating man. She then goes on to find Mr. Right and gets to tell her cheating ex to get lost. This movie takes a look at the emotional roller-coaster of a jilted man... without taking itself too seriously. Ryan Dunn does an excellent job as the jilted man and with Bam Margera and Brandon Dicamillo as your best friends trying to help you through this rough time how can you take anything too seriously? It is obvious that Margera and Co. are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera. I look forward to their future films and endeavors. ,positive
 With boundless raw energy and an uncompromising vision Talk Radio brilliantly explores the public's fondness for reducing strangers' private problems into entertainment via the radio. Eric Bogosian is sensational as Barry Champlaine a rude in-your-face talk radio host. He's a natural for this kind of role and fine tunes one of the most impressive interesting radio personalities I've ever seen on screen. The timing and delivery of his insults to his various callers are strokes of genius. Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry's boss. He demonstrates the same explosive cynicism that he would later display 1992's Glengarry Glen Ross. But the supporting role that truly stands out is the stoned seemingly brain-dead teen played by Michael Wincott. You have to see it to believe it. Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a great job with the photography which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcasting room. The claustrophobic feel of the movie perfectly mirrors its tone. After all one of the major points of the film is exploiting people's private moments to draw an audience. Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too private for the whole world to experience. Talk Radio is a film with strong emotional and cerebral impact - the likes of which are seldom seen today. ,positive
 This movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end. Not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character. Consequently if you are not into tragedies this is not your movie. It is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile. If you liked Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons. The intriguing question that the movie prompts is What is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly-aproved ideas for another set? The new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo-if you are a conservative you will not like this movie. Besides other philosophical questions I must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well. The grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start. Also there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters. If these sorts of things do not impress you skip it. Overall I give this movie a 7. ,positive
 It is a very great film (documentary) about Istanbul and their people and it's music of every kind. Editing and the success of the director is very impressive. I've been interested with Faith Akin since I saw the Gegen die Wand ( Head-On ) ( Duvara Kars&#305; ) and I admired his work very much but this one has been the most touching one for me so I'm here writing this. It is not just about Turks or something like that it is a very good biography of a city and how music stay alive in it we can say. There are views of many people and so very variant ideas about even life and love. I liked it very much and I thing anyone and everyone should see it NOT ONLY but especially the ones anyhow related with Turkey... ,positive
 Black Water is a movie that in a way surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations. Black Water is truly a very well structured unpredictable thrilling well directed and well creepy movie. The plot is actually somewhat original and will definitely keep you intrigued with it. One thing I love about this movie is the direction because mainly on how it surpassed my original expectations. My original expectations of Black Water was that it was a crappily made acted directed paced and boring movie. It really wasn't. Well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were I feel they didn't show enough emotions and there are some lines that feel just so scripted. However I love the direction because all of it's shots seem predictable but arn't. Like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water and it goes quite you're like the croc's about to attack. However the croc's attacks are very unpredictable(which was bad for me who doesn't handle films like this all to greatly) and this does make you jump. Plus I just love that it's one of those horror movies that don't rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump but instead the actual movie. I also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees it made it seem very real and definitely kept your eyes on the screen. I must say I didn't think the opening 20 so minutes were done well and I think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life. Plus I didn't like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasn't. Also again I just don't think some of the characters actions were realistic. For example I wouldn't have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it let alone a killer one. However these problems really arn't that major and I was still able to enjoy the film. Overall as far as movies go I've seen better but as far as animal attack horror films(a genre I get easily scarred at) it's one of the better ones you'll see. And sure it's not perfect but that doesn't mean it's not worth a shot. ,positive
 I found West Point to be an agreeable film although I doubt that I would watch it again. The performances were convincing with William Haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. It's hard to believe that stardom beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was made as she looks rather awkward at times. I would apply the comment made by another concerning Ramon Novarro's Huddle (1932) to this film as well. There is a great film waiting to be made here but there is something lacking. The backdrop and integration of the Corps was well utilized but I was less involved than I thought that I would be. Perhaps Haines' character went too far or got away with too much. His repentance did not seem genuine enough; and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the Army-Navy game? Where's the Corps in that? Might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself. Also I doubt very much that William Bakewell's weak puny character would ever have a real-life counterpart at West Point. All this aside the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. It is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution. Thank goodness that tradition still means something at West Point too unlike the vapid traditions of Ivy League schools only half-heartedly engaged in these days. As to the score: it was appropriately martial. But there was a distinct over-use of snare drums. Using them for knocks on the door scene transitions et ALU as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious. It rather lessened the viewing experience. I was ready to say I GET THE POINT ALREADY. With that enjoy the film but don't expect too much emotional involvement. ,positive
 Early in the movie Cagney's Johnny Cave character tells his gumshoes in the Office of Weights and Measures that in the previous year unscrupulous shop owners had cheated the American consumer out of more money than the aggregate National War Debt! Then he goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green grocer for short-selling him a bag of sugar that is four ounces off (oh the horrors!!) and one skinny chicken that his butcher's scale has rather generously proclaimed to be six lbs. after which the fur--or in this case feathers--flies. Er fly. When a racketeer in politician's clothing attempts to derail an investigation into the paltry poultry purveyor's practices our hero becomes a lone wolf waging the war of the weights on behalf of housewives across America. After all four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy! Word of his intransigence soon reaches both the Mayor and the Governor's offices and Cagney becomes a marked man. If it sounds silly it's not--the dishonest retailing practices are only a plot tool (or as Hitchcock would say the McGuffin) and while unfamiliar it works every bit as well here as any Treasury Agent or G-man anthology in which the fight is taken to shady crooks who are operating outside the interests of the country's common good. The production standards are decidedly Grade-B but it is Cagney who makes this movie the delight that it is: this was his first film away from Warner Brothers after seeking release in court from his unreasonable contract and he seems to be at ease and enjoying himself tremendously--the performance turned in here is intelligent and crackles with his unique energy and surefire charisma. Mae Clarke's presence lends a definite Warner's feel to the overall production. The supporting players turn in solid performances and the story moves along smartly after a rocky introduction that seems to begin three or four reels into the story--but sit back and enjoy it for the Cagney showcase and engaging Depression-era time capsule that it is. ,positive
 I haven't seen this fine movie in 50 years but I'm entering a comment on it anyway. While JACK WEBB'S movie was no doubt intended purely as an entertainment --- showing Marine basic training at Parris Island in realistic terms as a tough character-building exercise -- it was said the military was afraid the movie would discourage recruitment's. It did not work out that way. The movie showed that entering the Marines was a greater challenge than most young people ever realized and (guess what?) being offered a king-sized challenge was exactly what many guys wanted. I personally knew lots of guys that joined the Marines shortly after seeing THE DI. Lines at recruitment centers were suddenly so long the Marines had more recruits than they could handle. So it goes. America will always have youth seeking to make themselves into the best --- while the slackers and born-losers limp along to nowhere. What we DON'T have in 2007 is any films that inspire patriotism devotion to duty of any kind positive values et cetera. What we DO have is films that inspire the airhead-ed to be airheads the beer drinkers to guzzle beer other negative values. Exhibit #1 is that the airhead teen travesty and beer guzzling epic SUPERBAD is now #81 in the All Time Great Films list. Values? What'cha mean values? ,positive
 When I sat down in the cinema to see this I was expecting to see a sort of stylish tongue-in-cheek action film which had been implied by the trailers. However it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be more. Normally I don't approve of films that try to entertain in as many ways possible. For instance this film tries to mix action with comedy romance lightheartedness and gritty seriousness all at once. Most of the time this sort of approach doesn't work in films (just look at Batman Forever) but I was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they pulled it off. The end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature cinemagoers. (However the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller pull of a brilliant double act and Ken Stott does a excellent villain. This mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch. However the big let-down here for me is that in having 'The Gentleman Highwayman' there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in punchiness and there were few belly laughs. Okay so the lines weren't terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent British films; ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of Hollywood's efforts. ,positive
 The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I have seen every actor who's played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov! ,positive
 For avid Sci-Fi fans this movie is just what you've been waiting for. Watching this movie gets you lost into the characters especially Riddick the movies bad guy. This is the case where you root for the bad guy and want to see him live and win. As you watch the survivors struggle to stay alive you long to see who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have taken over this planet. An excellent movie Vin Diesel did a wonderful job as convict Riddick and the acting and suspense were ravishing.A+ ,positive
 I saw the movie in Izmir as the closing film of Izmir film festival. I didn't know anything about it but right now I'm glad I didn't refuse the chance to see Ding-a-ling-less! It IS one of the funniest movies I've ever watched and believe me I've seen zillions of movies!! (I'm a film critic!) Clever script and dialogs... Smart details... What else can I say? AN indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor... One can't stop by wonder what he's capable of right now. Ding-a-ling less was shot five years ago and i'm sure the director Onur Tukel is more mature now. I heard that his next feature will be a political satire and I really can't wait to see that too among with his previous works like House of Pancakes ... ,positive
 Perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself. What i want to point out here is that distant is not only an art-house film but one of the best art-house films. From all the art-house films I have seen distant is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold. It is even fair to say that this film's cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass Tarkovsky's Nostalgia. One commentator got it right that sex a jaded common feature among foreign films is surprisingly lacking in distant and in a good way. What is most remarkable about distant is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world. Fortunately distant doesn't have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings. ,positive
 The 221 episodes of The Lone Ranger were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndication. For most of the original broadcast years the series was ABC's most watched piece of programming. The new DVD set from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (15 Sept-29 Dec 1949) and for some reason unknown to me episode 22 from the fifth season for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available on last year's Mill Creek Entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain). These sets pretty much render The Legend of the Lone Ranger movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases. The early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voice-over narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments. The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear-cut good and evil distinctions and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started out Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to Lone Ranger status his partnering with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels) and the taming of his horse Silver . There is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode. The Lone Ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil. While a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an Indian was distrusted the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do evil. One persistent theme is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value. The trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question: who was that masked man? . To really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be. If you don't take it seriously and keep wishing for some self-reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child. ,positive
 Trey Parker and Matt Stone the creators of South Park finally get out of their grueling schedule to talk to the cameras while sipping champagne in their hot tub. At first when watching this I did not sense as much sarcasm as there was in this. I knew they were joking when they would complain about different actors on the show and when Trey said he wasn't going to give his mother any of his money but there is so much sarcasm throughout that this documentary is more of a mockumentary full of inside jokes. This documentary shows everything about South Park (up until the second season anyways). It shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording. It has interviews many of which are fake interviews but some amongst all the fabrications give insight into the show. Clips from both of Trey Parker's Spirit of Christmas shorts are shown as are many good clips from the show. If you were a South Park fan then this should have quenched your thirst for show knowledge back in late 1998 when this was made. Now obviously the show has changed but this is still interesting. What we have here is an amusing documentary where Trey Parker (especially) and Matt Stone come off as arrogant jerks and that's exactly what they wanted to come off as. They may be this way in real life but here it was a joke a 51 minute long insightful joke. My rating: *** out of ****. 51 mins. Not rated contains Language and Sexual Content. ,positive
 Although this film is set amongst the sophisticated English upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder. It has a slightly dated air being an adaptation of A Way Through the Wood a 1950 novel by Nigel Balchin (once hugely popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes who despite an academy award for the script of Gosford Park has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by Julian. His primary focus was on getting his characters right and by and large he has succeeded. In this he was helped by two outstanding performances from Tom Wilkinson as James the stitched up City lawyer and Emily Watson as his attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; the running time is only 80 minutes. James and Anne have a town house in Chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is some years younger but they are childless. Outwardly they seem happy but James one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer) is a control freak. Just down the road is the aristocratic the Hon. William Buel who is not one for middle-class morality and he is more than happy to take advantage. But there's a complication a road accident in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover just like the Hon. Bill's. Soon James Anne Bill and the victim's widow (who happens to be James' and Anne's cleaner) are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened. The primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on James and Anne's relationship. The third person in this ménage a trios Bill is played by Rupert Everett. From the point of view of casting his languid superior manner is right for the part yet somehow he doesn't quite get there. Partly this is because he is supposed to be sick for some of the time and he looks well when he is supposed to be sick and vice-versa. The part seems underdeveloped. It is interesting that John Neville as Bill's father who has only one significant scene manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he has. The world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely evoked. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary these people are able to convince themselves that the Edwardian age still exists. At bottom though the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart. Nigel Balchin was going through a marriage break-up when he wrote the book and Fellowes has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere. As he says his is a fairly free adaptation but the central theme is the same. ,positive
 I have never read a Jacqueline Susann novel but I have also seen Valley of the Dolls based on another of her books. On both occasions I thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age (certainly contrary to the books). The reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion design and behavior patterns. And in this aspect The Love Machine offers quite a lot. The set design fits the story perfectly. And all the characters fit in too. They're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture. They are superficial and do not develop it is true but in this movie I wouldn't want it any different. David Hemmings reprises the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a rip-off. He's a fashion photographer looks visibly aged and seems to start going slightly to seed. Robert Ryan reprises the role he played in Max Ophül's Caught he is Smith Ohlrig all over again greedy bored and boring uninspired and uninspiring. It's possible Ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. Whatever happened it fits the picture. Dyan Cannon is great (fantastic wardrobe!) she dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie: the burning of a luxurious bed and the knocking down of the Hemmings character with a Academy Award statuette. The title The Love Machine is of course meant ironically. Robin Stone is a kind of a Barry Lyndon of the pop era (incidentally the movie IS slightly kubrickysh). That he chooses a TV station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence. He sees love (meaning sexual favors) merely as a means for personal advancement. There are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie. Homosexuality is treated very casually probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period. The open cynicism of the TV executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like A Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show. They are producing crap they agree among themselves it's crap and they know they will make a lot of dough with it. I did not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following provided it's given the chance (meaning a DVD release). ,positive
 Good show really good acting and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting unpredictable way especially since essentially it's two people in a room. It doesn't race through like many modern films but doesn't drag either. Bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the now of her character which is still involved and not going back on her 'career' choices - so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep self-examination of her soul...Brundage has the delicate balance of weight innocence meekness and class to pull off 'Buddy' very well. A bit grainy on the film quality but it fits the tone of the story. Could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things but definitely worth watching. ,positive
 A wonderful story...so beautiful told..so intense so whit no keyboard to describe I think... go see it feel it... it tell's a story about love romance war and be trail so wonderful so full of romance if you love romance see it if you don't love romance drama well skip it that's all I can I vote 10 out of 10 stars wonderful... ,positive
 It may not be Oscar material however this was a very funny film. I was always a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) & Richie (Mayall). Bottom & Young Ones were legendary TV series' and it was about time they made a film. Some of the stuff they get up to is brilliant from the pencil is the rear-end to the rubber sex-pants as well was the infamous line that Richie says when he falls and a candle he is carrying goes into his eye. He says to Eddie Candle In The Eye Candle In The Eye and Eddie been the simpleton that he is sticks the candle he's carrying into his eye. Can't forget when Eddie is on his motorbike and he needs to urinate.... It was a great comedy not to be taken seriously at all but the film lacked with an ridicilous ending. Overall a exellent comedy full of laughs and lots of fake green vomit. A 9/10. ,positive
 This movie is my families favorite Christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what Christmas is really all about. These days living in a big city which I hate I love to watch movies about the life I've always dreamed of having. The town that this movie is set in is my dream come true for the life I've always wanted and the true feeling of community that has been lost in todays society. I truly don't feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore but watching this movie helps to find that feeling again. My family taped this movie long ago of TV and now our copy has been worn out so I would really like to buy a few copies on DVD for my family and me if anyone can tell me where I can buy some copies please just post the info here and I will keep checking. Thanks. ,positive
 I saw Heaven-Ship ( Himmelskibet ) at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile Italy. What a great movie! This Danish steampunk saga is the stirring tale of the first trip to Mars in an era when wireless telegraphy hasn't been perfected. The spaceship hasn't got a radio and the heroes are brought back from the landing field via horsecart. Even the intertitles are delightful ... some of them written in rhymed couplets in the original Danish. The actors' performances are laughable largely hand-to-brow histrionics. But the sets are astonishing easily surpassing anything done by Georges Melies a decade earlier (or in Die Frau im Mond a decade later). Of course the plot is simplistic. The spaceship's crew consist of seven thin guys and one fat slob. Guess which one cracks. Interestingly everyone in this movie (except the dubious Professor Dubius) ardently believes in God. Even the Martians. Impressively the scenarists have the sense to acknowledge that a trip to Mars is no doddle: the title cards establish that it takes the scientists two years to build their spaceship (which has an airscrew) and six months to reach Mars. During the construction sequence there's one extremely impressive set-up which must have been choreographed: dozens of workers all hustle through the worksite in different directions with no hesitations and no collisions. The Danish scientists christen their ship Excelsior ( packing materials ?) and set course for Mars even though the Moon and Venus are closer. When the ship (which flies horizontally not vertically) lands on Mars it is greeted by Marsboerne -- Martians -- who turn out to be Nordic blondes all highly-developed pacifists and vegetarians. (As a highly-developed meat-eater I resented that part.) Conveniently enough Mars turns out to have an atmosphere just like Earth's as well as equal gravity. In an exterior shot of the Martian landscape the Sun's apparent magnitude when seen from Mars is the same as it is when viewed from Earth. I also couldn't help observing that all the wise elder Martians are male. In fact female elders are thin on the ground here: both the Earth-born hero and the Martian maiden are motherless. The Martians speak a universal language wear ankhs on their robes and greet the Earth visitors with a globe of Earth ... which of course they hold with its North Pole upward. That Martian maiden is Marya played by an ethereally beautiful Danish actress. (Waiter I'll have some of that Danish!) We see a Martian dance of chastity which might have been twee or ludicrous but is actually quite touching and beautiful. Also the Martian funeral scene features one shot which reminded me of a sequence in The Seventh Seal . I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this film. Himmelskibet has a few flaws but its production design and its other merits very far outweigh its drawbacks. The Ole Olsen who is named in the credits (and who appears in a brief prologue) is no relation to Chic Johnson's vaudeville partner from Hellzapoppin . I would give Himmelskibet a 12 but the scale tops off at 10 ... so a full 10 out of 10 for this delightful trip to Mars the blonde planet! ,positive
 As I stated earlier this year in my review of Swordfish (which was scripted by this films writer/director/producer Skip Woods) this is a good film. It ranks very high up there in my crime flick list among Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Basically I think this film is for me what Reservoir Dogs was for many people - a cult classic - although I prefer to compare it with Pulp Fiction. I mean I never liked Tarantino's first effort a lot but I sure as hell liked this one as much as I like Pulp Fiction for it simply has everything a classic needs. A great story and good actors. OK the budget might be not as big as in for instance Godzilla The Avengers of Mission to Mars but it sure as hell beats the living crap out of those films (and numerous others). The story of this film is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane) who has settled down with his wife in Houston. Unexpectedly an old friend of his comes by disrupting his life revealing his secrets and basically making his day a living hell (and a bloody one too). The film is very original and quite bloody / sexually tinted. So based on that first and that last quality I can assure you that if you like this film you'll also like Swordfish which of course has a much bigger budget and more famous faces than this one but is just as good (though not as bloody and not quite as sexually tinted). I saw this film for the second time last night and I really enjoyed it (again). I mean all the characters and actors are good although I must give very big credits to Thomas Jane and Paulina Porizkova who were the best actors (and had the best characters) in the film. Also I'd have to thank Skip Woods for being so imaginative and original. Brutal sexual offensive??? Maybe but sure as heck enjoyable and a thrill ride to the end. 8 out of 10 ,positive
 This is a movie that really makes you think about your life our culture family structures and situational actions. I will not give the plot in this post I think others have beat me to it already. I hope that despite reading opinions on this site you will take the chance and see this movie for yourself. I went to see this movie with my husband and a friend and I must say after the movie was over there was total silence in the theater. After a few minutes I looked behind me and everyone in the theater was staring at the screen lost in thought. This will make you delve deep into your psychological abyss to ponder several things: How much does society influence my life and the lives of my generation? How long does someone have to pay for mistakes that they have made? If there is a second chance given is it ever realized? Is it better to live in a box or to not live at all? My questions are not intended to show my approval or disapproval of Leland's actions. I do not want my opinion of them to in any way dictate what you will take away from this film so I am not giving it. See it for yourself. I am still lost in thought attempting to answer my many questions from the film. I enjoyed it greatly and hope that you will too. This film is not trying to answer questions condone any action or promote any punishment. This movie is trying to make us all evaluate our lives and take off the rose colored glasses that most of us view the world through. Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars ,positive
 My favourite police series of all time turns to a TV-film. Does it work? Yes. Gee runs for mayor and gets shot. The Homicide hall of fame turns up. Pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series. A lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn´t seen the TV-series but it amuses the fans too. The last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up. And a short appearance from my favourite coroner Juliana Cox. This is a good film. ,positive
 The Youth In Us is a pitch-perfect gem. I saw this stunning short at this year's 2005 Sundance Festival. The story took me on a profoundly transforming journey. The directing by Joshua Leonard the acting of Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas the art direction the cinematography the score -- every element was true to the bone. One can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is prelude to more great work from this gifted director. Just as a short film is shown before a feature at Sundance commercial movie theatres used a similar format in times past. It would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like The Youth In Us could reach a wider audience this way. ,positive
 If you enjoy suspense this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense. Alec Guiness's appearance was nice but didn't really add to the movie. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot. I thought the cinematography was excellent. This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well. The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful. Also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to Andy Clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done. I would call it overall good entertainment ,positive
 I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was perhaps the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the TV show The Big Valley . Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence. And so it was for Christmas in Connecticut a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about Christmas. It does however have Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some supreme character actors including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today. To begin the plot concerns a magazine writer (Stanwyck) who the magazine's readers believe is a domestic goddess married with a child and living on a farm in Connecticut but who is really single lives in New York City and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking. Could anyone get away with such a fraud even then? Apparently and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and Stanwyck Greenstreet a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan) and Stanwyck's restaurateur friend (S.Z.Sakall) find themselves spending Christmas in Connecticut at a farm belonging to Stanwyck's boorish boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all. Morgan and Stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married. Regardless they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh. Meanwhile the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who has seen Stanwyck and Morgan go off together but still doesn't get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind. At this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd not funny ha ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did. The good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after. I watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with Barbara Stanwyck. Thank goodness it was set at Christmas or like 95 percent of Stanwyck's movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew. ,positive
 After some further thought about this film I find it's far too easy to dismiss this as the Boy's dream. I have actually received some spiritual strength from Northfork.......Angels do exist....we definitely are entertained by Angels....most of the time we aren't even aware of it..... At a point of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life I personally really needed this film. Yes as I wrote before it speaks to so many......can't wait to get to Heaven... Being so sick of all of the FX and Formula stuff I found this film to be genuine Cinema. All I can say is it touched me in so many ways that I still am sorting it all out. North Fork is a wonderful film. One that brings the viewer's mind out of the gutter and into the heart. The spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me. Pay attention as you'll need to use the brain and heart God gave you to follow the story. I think it's possibly a bit over the heads of some but I feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly. I want to view it several more times just so I can take it all in! The Industry needs to study this film to realize we do exist. My thanks to all involved in the making of this film.  ,positive
 Loosely based on actual events River's Edge is a film much in the style of David Lynch about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends but no one does anything about it for a long time. With top notch acting by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film. The film begins with a young boy Tim (Joshua John Miller) dropping a doll off of a bridge (murder #1). Tim then hears someone yelling when he looks up he sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) standing on the bank of the river with the dead naked body of his girlfriend behind him (murder #2). Samson eventually shows the body to his friends. All of which are horrified not only because of the murder but also because the victim Jamie (Danyi Deats) was a friend of theirs. Despite all of this no one goes to the police. You may think this is unrealistic but this is what happened in the real story. If you are familiar with the story of Alpha Dog (2006) you will know that the same thing happened there as well. Through all of this Layne (Crispin Glover) is working to keep Samson safe although no one (including Samson) seems to care about keeping him out of harms way. As time goes on we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper) a middle aged shut in who deals drugs to the local teenagers has also killed a woman before (murder #3). From here things begin to close in on Samson and his friends and eventually everything is revealed but not in the way you may be expecting. In the film we learn of three murders each one with a different reason a different reaction and a different effect on those involved. When Tim drops his younger sister's doll off of the bridge we are never made aware of his motive. However we do see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams while her mother consoles her. Later her older brother Matt (Keanu Reeves) helps her put a cross in the yard in remembrance of her doll. The murder of Jamie horrifies everyone (except Samson who is apathetic to the whole situation and when asked by Layne why he did it Samson replies with She was talking sh*t. ) but they do not sob or scream the run away and go on with their lives trying to forget what had happened. In Feck's situation he did not kill his girlfriend out of hate. We never really know why he killed her but we see that Feck is not proud of what he had done. He even mentions that he is sorry and that her loved her. From this we see the different ways we can be affected by death. In the film it is easy for us to identify with the teenagers because they do not know what they feel or how they should feel about the death of their friend. In much the same way we the audience do not know how to feel because we do not know Jamie. We are obviously saddened by the death and realize that Samson should be arrested but we don't feel strongly for Jamie as an individual. There are several similarities between River's Edge and Twin Peaks (1990-1991) especially in the overall feel of the film. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch were thinking of River's Edge when they were creating their series. After all Tim Hunter did go on to direct three episodes of Twin Peaks . Crispin Glover's performance as the hyperactive frantic Layne is an Oscar worthy performance. Always in a rush and always worried about keeping Samson from getting caught Layne is an intense character that seems to be on speed. If you have seen Crispin Glover in any film you know that he can deliver a line like no one else. It is always a treat to see him perform. The other great performance in River's Edge is by Dennis Hopper. His portrayal of Feck the shut in drug dealer who has one leg and an inflatable sex doll he talks to named Elly reminded me of a more toned down and more humorous version of Frank Booth Hopper's character in David Lynch's film Blue Velvet (1986). River's Edge is great film and I believe it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when in reality we need to step up and speak out against the evils in the world. ,positive
 The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised). However while this seems like bad and contrived writing it is not....as this is all part of an elaborate ruse by the writer to have a group of actors in the home act out his plot. However part-way through the ruse the producer and his browbeaten assistant figure out that the murder mystery taking place in the home is fake and think the whole affair is pretty funny. What no one realizes though is that an escaped maniac is loose and he is about to enter this contrived little plot--making for some wonderful twists and turns. So when it seems that there is a real murder the actors are truly terrified while Carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax. While I have explained some of the plot there are many more aspects of the film you'll just have to figure out yourself--and it's surely to keep you entertained and guessing. Considering that this is a B-movie in the public domain I certainly did NOT have very high hopes for this little film. However I was thrilled when the film turned out to be a much better than average flick--with a very interesting and novel twist on the old clichéd plot about a dark and stormy night spent in a mansion. Plus while the plotting of the film was very good the dialog was even better--with lots of sparkling wit and a nice light-hearted pace. Full of pleasant surprises and well worth your time. ,positive
 I actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it's even better then The Deer Hunter which was overrated. Both this movie and Year Of The Dragon are very underrated although i could see why someone would not like this movie. At three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting over Isabelle Huppert but she can't make up her mind about which one to be with. Sam Waterston is the villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed who is says are anarchists and thieves. There is a great cast that also has Jeff Bridges Brad Dourif and a young Mickey Rourke. ,positive
 NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet and the story that follows and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care. James Franco in another micro role is just the right casting and the elegance of Lane in combination with the beach house is a true Fall 2008 film to remember forever as was THE NOTEBOOK. ,positive
 If there are people that don't like this movie I don't think they are human. This film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997 this is one of the best movies I have seen and really the film that Judith Light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers. This movie although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me! The plot doesn't have much to it but the acting provided by Judith Light is incredible. She looks beautiful the whole time and by the end you don't want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her. Overall a movie worth my highest praise! Thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty. I eagerly await this movie to come out on DVD or some other form of media since Lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers. Although I don't have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago which is still hard to believe since this movie is STILL ingrained into my head after all this time. ,positive
 If you're looking for a kung-fu action movie look elsewhere. While there are fighting scenes the film revolves around its provincial protagonist who struggles to find her way in Americanized Canton. Unlike most kung-fu comedies the action scenes are used to reinforce the comedy instead of the other way around. Cheung Booi is a statement about the farcical nature of kung-fu movies where the stars always seem to find some reason to fight. Instead of some grand drama about honor and respect minor misunderstandings cause the characters to yell at each other and start beating each other up. My Young Auntie as it's known in the West is the story of Cheng Tai-nun played by Kara Hui who is a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to keep his holdings from falling into the hands of his greedy and corrupt brother. After he dies she moves to Canton to live with her nephew played by director Lau Kar Leung and his son Ah Tao played by Hsiao Ho. The basis of the irony is that although Cheng is the same age as Ah Tao her manner is more akin to her status as his step-great-aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely poorly) plays the guitar and goes to costume parties Cheng utterly fails when she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in Canton complete with makeup revealing gowns high heels and dance scenes. What makes this movie great is its realization. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the greatest if not the greatest director of his generation in Hong Kong and Kara Hui won Best Actress at the first Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. Also this is arguably Hsiao Ho's finest performance. His chemistry with Hui is remarkable and although he went on to have a storied career in kung-fu comedies often working alongside Sammo Hung he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy. As the romantic tension and intrigue build in the second half of the movie his entire countenance changes. No longer does he easily jaunt through life without a care in the world. He becomes the straight man and his cohorts the Kramer Elaine and George. My one complaint is how suddenly the comedic aspects of the film die off during the conclusion. The film transitions from outright farce to dramatic intrigue with little but a change in incidental music. But there is a certain symmetry in it. The film begins focused on the intrigue focused more on Lau Kar Leung's character and it ends that way too. But the final scene returns to the movie's comedic roots giving conclusion to both aspects of the film. ,positive
 This is a surprisingly great low budget Horror/Comedy it's funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending!. All the characters are pretty cool and the story while unoriginal is very good plus Eric Jungmann(Adam) and Justin Urich(Harley) had fantastic chemistry together. One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Adam is trapped in the bathroom and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to take a p*ss in the truck and Aimee Brooks is just plain sexy! plus this is one of the best low budget Horror films I have seen in a long time. It's very gory but in a comical way and I thought it was very well written as well plus Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as the Monster Man and had some wicked makeup!. It's similar to films like Joy Ride Duel Jeepers Creepers etc etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there plus The gore effects are really well done for the most part. This is a surprisingly great low budget Horror/Comedy it's funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Michael Davis does a very good! job here with great camera work good angles good use of colors and using a great setting plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace. There is a lot of gore!. We get extremely bloody nose bleeds gory impaling's bloody stabbings guy is cut in half by a monster truck human remains in a cooked stew guts all over the place guys guts fall out pencil in the eyes bloody slit throat bunch of people walking around without limbs gory dead squirrel heads are squished severed limbs bloody and mangled corpses decent amount of bloodshed one very gory scene at the very end and more!. The Acting is very good for a low budget film. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam he was a nerd but a very likable one he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich had some cool lines and I just loved his character he also seemed to be enjoying himself and he was especially good at the end!. Justin Urich is excellent as the ass of a Best Friend however I just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny and often stole a lot of the scenes I really dug him!. Aimee Brooks is gorgeous and did great with what she had to do she had good chemistry with Jungmann and like Jungmann was especially good at the end as I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man he was very creepy looking had some awesome makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers!. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5 ,positive
 Darr (1993) was an incredible movie. In my opinion it is one of Bollywood's finest. The movie itself triggers feelings of sympathy fear confusion happiness and sadness. Shahrukh's role was unbelievable in fact he gave obsession a new face. Juhi Chawla's innocent and girlie character contrasted greatly with Shahrukh's fiery and passionate character. Sunny Deol's role made the good guy role seem like the bad guy one. The fact that Shahrukh not Sunny captivated the audience's attention proves that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something that's not really in their hands. Even though the movie is several years old it surpasses any recent one. The song Tu Mere Samne was full of passion and meaning. His personality fit the role perfectly. He should seriously consider re-starring in a similar film. ,positive
 i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all no surprise it's what crispin glover's character (layne) does. he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his the killer's girlfriend. not because layne did not like this individual rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life and dead inside that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it provides him with something to focus on. ,positive
 I guess I wasn't sure to what to expect from this film it had a good cast an interesting story line and a bunch of other things going for it but I still couldn't shake a feeling of dread that I had in my stomach about what it would be like. I am glad to say that I was very pleased with the result and regret worrying about it all along. The films opening scenes were extremely intriguing and were enough to sustain early interest in the film. As the film progressed we were introduced to the characters of the film as well as what happened in the prison riots. Like most reviews for this film I have to admit that there is some unessecary cliches but it can't erase the overall power of this film that reads like a good novel. The cast are all great particularly Chestnut and McGowan and the film ranks as one of the better made-for-tv films of this year. Certainly worth watching if you are looking for a good courtroom drama. ,positive
 In the groovy mid 70's a scruffy bunch of brash young Venice California adolescents from broken homes and the bad side of town known as the Z-Boys turned the previously staid world of professional skateboarding on its ear with their fierce punk attitude radical unconventional riding style and unbridled spirit of pure in-your-face aggression revolutionizing the sport in the process and paving the way for the many extreme variations on sports that popped up in their influential wake. Director Stacy Peralta who's one of the legendary Z-Boys himself relates the incredible exploits of this amazing ragtag crew in a ferociously punchy and visceral manner that's both informative and wildly entertaining: the snappy rapid-fire editing ceaseless speedy pace and raw gritty photography deliver one hell of an infectiously kinetic buzz projecting a sense of sheer joy and full-on bustling energy that's a total pleasure to behold. Better still this documentary neither sanitizes nor romanticizes its subjects: These rough'n'scrappy lads were so fiercely competitive and out for themselves that they all went their separate ways when the lure of fame and fortune manifested in their lives. The ultimate fates of certain guys is poignant and heartbreaking with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat Jay Adams rating as the saddest and most tragic: He blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail. The other dudes are very colorful and personable as well; charismatic ball of cocky and defiant fire Tony Alva in particular comes across as one arrogant yet impressive piece of furiously assertive work. Marvelously narrated with delightfully easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by Sean Penn. The terrific rock soundtrack likewise seriously smokes. But what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing complete dearth of pretense: It's every bit as dynamic exuberant and larger-than-life extraordinary as the gloriously outrageous Z-Boys themselves. ,positive
 1956 was the 20th Congress of the Communist Party and the Soviet Premier Krushchev made a speech denouncing Stalin and the Stalinist purges and the gulag labor systems revealing information that was previously forbidden publicly revealing horrible new truths which opened the door for a new Soviet Cinema led by Mikhail Kalatozov once Stalin's head of film production. This film features a Red Army that is NOT victorious in fact they are encircled in a retreat mode with many people dying including the hero in a film set after 06-02-41 the German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced the Barbarossa Plan a blitzkrieg invasion intended to bring about a quick victory and the ultimate enslavement of the Slavs and very nearly succeeded actually getting within 20 miles of Moscow in what was a Red Army wipe out a devastation of human losses 15 to 20 million Russians died or 20% of the entire population. Historically this was a moment of great trauma and suffering a psychological shock to the Russian people but the Red Army held and prolonged the war 4 more years until they were ultimately victorious. During the war Stalin used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting introducing female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers. Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy an obvious reference to Stalin himself who was always portrayed in film as a bold wise and victorious leader. But Kalatozov changed this depiction as THE CRANES ARE FLYING was made after Stalin's death causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or as well as the Best Director and Best Actress (Tatyana Samoilova) reawakening the West to Soviet Cinema for the first time since Eisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 40's. This film featured brilliant breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky using spectacular crane and tracking shots images of wartime battlefields Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real. Another brilliant scene features the lead heroine Veronica who hasn't heard from her lover Boris in the 4 years at war so he is presumed dead but she continues to love him expressed in a scene where she runs towards a bridge with a train following behind her a moment when the viewer was wondering if she might throw herself in front of that train instead she saves a 3 yr old boy named Boris who was about to be hit by a car. Another scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield who dies a senseless death and his thoughts spin and whirl in a beautiful montage of trees sky leaves all spinning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams including an imaginary wedding with Veronica. This film features the famous line You can dream when the war is over. In the final sequence when the war is over the soldiers are returning in a mass scene on the streets Veronica learns Boris died all are happy and excited with the soldier's return but Veronica is in despair passing out flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness revealing cranes white and gray floating in the sky. The film was released in 1957 in Russia and according to some reviews the silence in the theater was profound the wall between art and living life had fallen...and tears unlocked the doors.  ,positive
 Or if you've seen the Evil Dead trilogy and/or Bubba Ho-Tep then you should know that his movies are total farces. With Man with the Screaming Brain he goes all out again. In this case he plays smarmy American businessman William Cole visiting Bulgaria - when do we ever get to see that country? - when a woman kills him. So strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent leaving him acting sort of like Steve Martin in All of Me . Yes the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense. Much of the real humor comes from Evil Dead director Sam Raimi's brother Ted as Ivanov's nearly brain-dead assistant Pavel. The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the Skipper. So just understand that this is a totally silly movie and you won't be a bit disappointed. I liked it anyway. ,positive
 I just saw this movie at the Berlin Film Festival's Children's Program and it just killed me (and pretty much everyone else in the audience)! And make no mistake about it this film belongs into the all-time-250! Let me tell you that I'm in no way associated with the creators of this film if that's what you come to believe reading this. No but this actually is IT! Nevermind the kid's-film label on it Klatretösen ( Climber Girl ) is on almost every account a classic (as in biblical )! The story concerns 12-year old Ida (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg) who is devastated to learn of her daddy's terminal illness. Special surgery in the US would cost 1.5 million and of course nobody could afford that. So Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what every good kid would - and burglarize a bank! Sounds corny? Don't forget: This is not America and Klatretösen is by no means the tear-jerking Robin-Williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour nobody takes seriously anyway. Director Fabian Wullenweber set out to make a big-budget-action-comedy for kids and boy did he succeed! Let me put it this way: This film rocks like no kid-film and few others did before. And there's a whole lot more to it than just the action . After about 20 minutes of by-the-numbers-exposition (well granted) it accelerates into a monster that: - effortlessly puts mission impossible to shame (the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and look real expensive - take that mummy!) - dwarves almost every other movie suspense-wise ( no easy-they're-only-kids-antics here ) - easily laces a dense story with enough laughs to make jim carrey look for career alternatives - nods to both damon runyon and karate kid within the same seconds - comes up with so much wicked humor that side of p.c. that I can hear the American ratings board wet their pants from over here - manages to actually be tender and serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod what am I saying?? they're kids! they're kids! - nevermind watch that last scene!) - stars Stafan Pagels Anderson who since last years Mirakel is everybody's favourite kid actor What a ride! ,positive
 The antiwar musical Hair is my number one cult-movie. I do not know how many time I have seen this film in the movie-theaters and on VHS or how many times I have listened the CD with the stunning soundtrack and now this masterpiece has been finally released on DVD in Brazil. The pacifist and touching story is still amazing a hymn of freedom friendship and liberty of choices and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70's and their dreams since the present world is probably worse than in the 70's. I do not recall who won the Oscar in 1979 but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upper-class teenager. I have seen Hair probably more than twelve times and my eyes always get wet while Berger walks to the airplane singing That's me that's me that's me and I start crying with his gravestone in the cemetery. I believe this is one of the most beautiful sad and touching conclusions of the cinema history. My wife my daughter and my son also love this film; therefore I can guarantee that Hair is timeless and recommended for any audience. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): Hair  ,positive
 Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching. From that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is. It is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known. It's filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top DJs (e.g. DJ Q-Bert DJ Shadow and Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys) showing off their stuff. Going into the film I wasn't sure that scratching can really be called an art form or that the turntable can be viewed as an instrument in its own right. Scratch completely changed my mind on these points. What these guys do with their turntables is truly amazing--it is definitely some kind of art--and the turntable if you know how to use it can be transformed into an instrument that you can play as much as a drum or a guitar. And you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching from DJ Q-Bert (e.g. how to use the fader to get different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching Herbie Hancock perform his song Rock It (you remember that song don't you?) live at the Grammys. What got their attention was not Hancock himself but his DJ and his scratching. Not only is Scratch about scratching but it does some scratching of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. There are moments where clips are quickly rewound and then forwarded several times which mirrors (in the film medium) what happens when a DJ quickly moves the record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader (that wicka-wicka-wicka sound). Whether you're a fan of hip hop or not you can count on Scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies. After seeing it I had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own. And I mean this as a compliment. ,positive
 I got this movie from eBay mainly because I'm gay and I love Til Schweiger. However it's one of those movies that when you watch it a second time you never say to yourself Hmm. I forgot about this boring part. I'll go make popcorn. It doesn't have that part. It's a very fluid and constantly interesting film. And yes Til Schweiger is worth it if nothing else. But it's a great movie even for straight guys. ,positive
 I am sorry to see that SURFACE has not been picked up for the NBC 2006-2007 season. I guess market demand for inane game and reality shows on broadcast television a reflection on our sense of culture has conquered a good story. I hope and pray that some network picks it up so it will continue on as does STARGATE and it's spin-offs. I also hope the producers find a venue where they can produce the level of Post Production they wished for in a TV Guide interview. Right now the reruns on Sci-Fi marathons will have to do. I for one would love to see where the story goes after the tsunami that ended Episode 15. I would like to find out the mastermind of the efficient effort to obfuscate the real identity of the creatures. FYC Morningbear ,positive
 The remarkable sometimes infuriating often brilliant films of John Cassavetes occupy a unique position in American cinema Low-budget partly improvised inspired by cinéma verité documentary and related to underground film they have nevertheless frequently managed to reach a wide and profoundly appreciative audience After drama studies the young Cassavetes quickly made his name as an unusually unrefined intense actor often appearing in films about disaffected rebellious youth such as Crime in the Streets and Edge of the City. Setting up an actors' workshop he worked to transform an improvisational experiment into his feature debut The result Shadows taking three years to complete and partly financed by his performances in TV's Johnny Staccato was a breakthrough in American cinema About the effect of racism on an already fraught relationship between two black men and their sister two of whom pass for white the film is impressive for its irregular seemingly formless style and naturalistic performances Plot was minimal mood and emotional apparent truth were everything ,positive
 Overall this is entertaining and odd film. Don't try to make sense of it. There are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with but Robert Cummings and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this Fugitive -like story. Unlike the popular TV show and then 1993 movie this fugitive isn't looking for a one-armed man but a two-armed Nazi saboteur by the the name of Frank Fry. Cummings ( Barry Kane ) gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in Los Angeles and goes on the lam looking for the man who did it (Fry) to clear his name. The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then Priscilla Lane ( Pat Martin ) enters the story and it starts to bog down a bit with some sappy dialog. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did that with his female characters to the point I wonder if he had a clue how woman talked. Lane's character here was a little lame. Actually the villains played by Otto Kruger ( Charles Tobin ) and Norman Lloyd ( Frank Fry ) were the best in my opinion......just fascinating. Kruger's acting and dialog was especially good. If you haven't seen this film but saw Hitchcock's well-known North By Northwest you'll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it. Instead of a climactic scene at Mount Rushmore here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the State Of Liberty. As usual Hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to view. ,positive
 There's a spartan unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic encumbrance telling us HOW we're meant to be feeling; in 'Blue' everything was overtly sad (sure powerful as hell but still); in 'White' it was delightful whimsy. But there are no such emotional clues or cues for that matter in this one. It's as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle-dazzle embelishment. I think that's what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three but finally the most transcendent and redemptive. Never has remorseless unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful. ,positive
 I couldn't stop watching this movie though it was far past my bedtime. Comparisons to Hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you. It walks a wonderful line between real immediate suspense and a dark distancing humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy. The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out. Right from the opening shots they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication; who is to be trusted and who is a monster. The plot twists and turns unpredictably. Suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork imagery music -- but most simply THE EYES of the characters which sends raw fear right into you. A warning: there is some frighteningly real gore as well as some nudity. The horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage-slasher pic. And a teen-slasher pic it AIN'T. The characters are quirky and feel like real people for one thing -- a couple (including the heroine) you may even find endearing as I did. There will be no mistake you're watching a movie made for grown-ups. I mean Alec Guinness is in it briefly and you know he didn't NEED the work! Pop this in the VCR some night when you can't sleep. . . and don't want to yet. ,positive
 The definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi nearly nails this concept on the head minus the cliché of pointy fangs and neck biting. Being an R rated movie I knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires. Which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to Twilight. Having viewed Chan-wook Park's preceding Oldboy I had very high expectations of Bakjwi. I anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our anti-hero known as Priest Sang-hyeon and was very impressed by his performance as a holy-man who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying his thirst as a vampire. (SPOILER) After the initial premise of him surviving the defective blood transfusion he starts to crave blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability. The screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition. He starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons. The oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative Tae-joo is very riveting as they are played by The Host's Kanh-ho Song and actress OK-vin Kim. The special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesn't offer anything new in the ways of stunts and CGI it didn't impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise. The story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own Korean style. There aren't many negatives I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long. The movie was long to begin with. On the same token vampires really don't have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with. As mentioned before this movie is very tragic so don't expect anything hopeful while watching this. Overall Bakjwi is delightfully dark morbid and original. I strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of Twilight. This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish Let The Right One In which is also a good movie. ,positive
 I first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters way back when. Seeing it again nearly 30 years later I was surprised at how well it has held up. The gags are still funny the interaction between characters works great and the cameos come off better than ever. (Steve Martin's has to be the best one.) My kids (9 11 and 14) all loved it and the music is good enough that they are still humming the tunes many days later. I would suggest that before seeing the movie you should view at least a half-dozen episodes of the Muppet Show to get a sense of the back-story behind the characters otherwise the movie won't make all that much sense. ,positive
 In a phrase moral ambiguity. In the Soderbergh remake there ARE good guys and bad guys. Benicio del Toro's character is clearly the good guy morally clean and uncorruptable. His counterpart in the BBC original Fazal the farmer turned dealer is realistically flawed and conflicted over his fate. The two relentless cops are similarly different. In the American one they win our hearts. In the BBC original they are over-zealous nearly obsessive. The best moment for me in Soderbergh's was when the college student rhetorically asked the Drug Czar What would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came into your neighborhood looking for drugs? That point was insinuated throughout the BBC show and crystallized in Jack Lithgow's final speech. Both are excellent but the BBC towers over the remake. My conclusion after seeing both shows is that dealers are innocent pawns who are only supplying a demand and it is the demand that causes so much suffering. ,positive
 I wish I could have met Ida Lupino. When people ask who you if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century persons over for dinner well for me one person would be her. I think she is now one of the great unsung and unprofiled personalities in the film industry. Her life story would make a great tele movie (Hey Mr Bogdanovich........). Ida Lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s. I can remember being saddened at seeing her reduced to a horrible part in a ghastly AIP film is the late 70s. She was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink. Ugh. I should have contacted her then as she died not long after.. more from the part than the worm too. From High Sierra Roadhouse and the extraordinary RKO thriller On Dangerous Ground Ida Lupino was often the producer and the lead actress. Later with her husband Howard Duff they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engrossing today. One of them is JENNIFER which I think is the last film with a Monogram Pictures copyright. Monogram changed the company name formally to Allied Artists in 1953 and JENNIFER has both company names on the opening credits. This is a superior haunted house thriller equally as scary as both The Innocents and The Haunting made 8 years later. Really chilling and very creepy this tiny film is exactly the sort of really good film Ida Lupino made and was responsible for. Try and find it...you will always remember it and as I feel much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress/producer. ,positive
 A SUPERMAN Cartoon. When America unveils its colossal new bomber the JAPOTEURS an elite force of Japanese spies & saboteurs strikes. Stealing the behemoth with intrepid girl reporter Lois Lane aboard and the destination either Tokyo or destruction it's time for Superman to get involved... This was another in the series of excellent cartoons initially created by Max Fleischer for Paramount Studio. They feature great animation and taut fast-moving plots. Meant to be shown in movie theaters they are miles ahead of their Saturday Morning counterparts. Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman; Joan Alexander does the honors for Lois Lane. ,positive
 Intense funny witty and more than anything social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it's results-be it good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces Nicholson to re-think the relationship and start to date other people so she won't feel so pristine when it comes to sexual experience. This leads to a disaster of events following Mohr Nicholson and their cohorts. Very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy condescending comedy while containing your usual variety of comedic sexual and frustrated characters(especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend...very annoying) who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary. The film goes the way films should go these days showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals. Most of the male characters are the moralistic straight forward eyes while the woman are the fresh faced street prowlers who will stop at nothing to get pleasure. Guys will be appreciative of the message made for guys with self respect however it is easy to assume that most males who DO see this film will use it's message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or trait that a female might find offending. Still the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for it's male leads particularly those of Mohr Richter and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man! The females are by far the most promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to... with someone else. They have amicable traits though even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens. Very funny stuff. On another level the film follows some of it's ensemble into different relationship work. Richter meets up with a stressed divorcée(a VERY remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable Helen Slater) named Penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father. As the two go deeper into a relationship human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting anew are studied. By the end of the film Mohr and Nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see what's coming next and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next. It becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time. Wallodorski's direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened...with the right ending. All in all this film should have been released nationwide and I should hope that it is up for some Academy Awards...maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. Anywho this film is a no hits miss give it all you got romantic sex farce displayed very maturely and aesthetically. Great film! ,positive
 I first saw this movie in the night program of one of my favourite TV channels.... I was hooked from the very first minute. Nothing is as it first seems lots of suspense great acting from Mr. van Dien and I did not mind the heat in it one bit ;-) ... and best of all: You are in for a surprise ending!!! ,positive
 In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this riveting film. Malkovich says he's going to kill the president and he purposely calls Eastwood and pushes his buttons. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cold but very intelligent mindset to his character. Everything he does he does for a reason and he's not shy about killing. Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich but no one wants to listen to him. The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn. ,positive
 TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish. Both the brothers were totally convincing and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame. If I had any complaint it was Gordon Clapp as the sheriff. He just doesn't look or act like a small-town Southern lawman named Byron Calhoun. He looks and sounds like Medavoy and Medavoy is not right for this part. But this is a minor quibble: The Morrison Murders is well worth watching and not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you're going out tape it. You won't regret it. ,positive
 Some may think Imaginary Heroes is a movie exactly like Igby Goes Down but it isn't. In Imaginary Heroes the director lets us feel for the Travis family and the people around them. The movie itself is great and the acting is extremely well done. Weaver's and Hirsch's acting is believable and helps make the movie what it is. The actors director/writer Dan Harris has made a movie that many people should see. Don't think this is just another teen movie it is a movie about a family and their problems. I gave this movie a 10/10 because I believe it isn't the best film which no film can be but its the closest it can get to perfect. ,positive
 A girl begins to notice that people in her small town are becoming fascinated by anything that is shaped like a spiral. Soon the fascination turns to obsession and things get deadly. While I won't say that Uzumaki was an excellent film I will say that it was unlike anything I've seen before. Throughout my viewing I felt like I was watching a cartoon. There are funny segues between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. Later I found out the film is an adaptation of a manga comic so this makes sense. However just when you think you are watching something that could be a kid's movie you are bombarded with nasty and gory visuals! The story often lags and the ending is somewhat abrupt and seemed anti-climactic at the time but in retrospect I appreciate it more for its originality. My Rating: 7/10. ,positive
 The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. There was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger but it was a good start for all that. As is now common with this Doctor the moral ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage. They were always there in the classic series but they were a side issue to be glossed over when the Doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle! This episode finally shows Mickey embracing the heroic side that had been hinted at in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is complete and it has been an utterly convincing one. With scares humour and scenes that brought a lump to your throat this episode had everything. After much consideration I can finally say that the new series betters the classic series in every single respect. Coming from a die hard Whovian you can get no better recommendation than that. ,positive
 This is a truly hilarious film and one that I have seen many times. Drew Barrymore is brilliant as Josie Geller as is David Arquette as her brother. You cringe with embarrassment at the thought of her returning to high school as the film is a reminder of what high school was really like! Her outfits are wacky and weird and it brings back memories of those who dressed a bit differently! The gorgeous Michael Vartan was adorable as the teacher (wish there had been teachers like that when I was at high school!) and Josie's boss is fantastic. This is a film you could watch again and again with a fabulous sound track! One for all those at school in the 90's to watch! ,positive
 Just saw this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. I have no special interest in wine and yet I found this very enlightening. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are. While he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer. He shows a lot of compassion to people (and dogs) and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don't want to tell. The movie shows us where our world is going to what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay. It is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big personal and global character and formula. The real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves. It takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing but it's worth it. Highly recommended. ,positive
 i am in a vast minority here. i also didn't much care for the original caddyshack aside from the chase/murray duo scene and select rodney jokes. okay break it down: rodney vs. jackie- both jewish and have similar humor. rodney's a bigger name and more distinct. jackie has an incidental and more observational approach to his jokes and is more 'up yours' in this sequel. jackie's attitude toward everything is memorable and in a way inspirational! his quick lines and over-confidence left me wishing i could express myself in such a way. rodney was good but there wasn't enough of him and he was more 'in your face' and dismissive. jackie in a rare film appearance makes a perfect sub for rodney (come on a gun shaped hair dryer?!?!) really look at the little things! stack vs. knight- both play snobby yuppies very well. ted knight despite his wonderful tv/film career kinda shows his age. but he does pull off the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see him fall. ted looks kinda weak and is pretty annoying playing his anger and frustration too slapstick while stack is more incidentally snide and vengeful; you really hate him and enjoy see him constantly fail. stack wins with me. murray vs. aykroyd- well both had great vintage SNL-like scenes with the ever-present and enjoyable chevy chase (ty webb). i did like the murray/chase one better. murray plays his great annoying chatty character with obvious improv skill and is loveable- yet annoying. and the exact same can be said for aykroyd. both get annoying after a while but it's a tie. i really loved part 2 over the first. they are 2 totally different mooded films. part one is more drug/bathroom/sex humor with a cast full of great names. part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a 'stick-it-to-the-rich' type of comedy that makes one feel better about being working class. 80s script? yes. a bit far-fetched? yes but wasn't the first? an insult to the sport of golf? yes it's a movie. thin story? yes it's a comedy with actual humor- not 'dances with wolves'!! besides- part 2 has a much better soundtrack!! PLEASE- DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE A SEQUEL TO PART ONE!! IT IS 98% ITS OWN MOVIE AND SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE NAME 'CADDYSHACK' IN IT. that said i am a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it is a great exponent of 80s fluff entertainment with quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON!!! to all the reducers- lighten up! it's a great comedy of its own. randy quaid was wonderful jonathan silverman was wonderful heck everyone was!! all this chatting and now i feel like watching it! i think i will ,positive
 A hilarious comedy by the best director ever Oz Scott. The list of eighties TV icons goes on and on. Milano (Who's The Boss) Yothers (Family Ties) Stone (Mr. Belvedere) Robinson (Night Court) Jackee (227) D'abo (Wonder Years) Walston (Mr. Hand!!!). It is one of the funniest movies ever. Great lines meaningless subplots cheesy bad acting. It is about a group of high school kids who need to pass drivers' ed. Mac from Night Court needs them to pass their final exam or he'll be fired. Great performance by Brian Bloom as the jerk/kinda cool guy Riko Conner but is nothing compared to B.D. Wong's Kiki (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie for all ages so bad it's good. ,positive
 Latter days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre. Most of the films entail sappy stories one night stands and let us not forget infamous baseball teams? Latter days actually contains male affection beyond the kiss in the dark and quite graphic material that made me wonder whether the film belonged at Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The films emotional journey is what sets it above the rest in the genre. Not until this film had I seen a story of such intense passion and love and the torture that it can bring. I think when people cry during movies they should be beaten but I found myself sobbing throughout several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live. I suggest every gay male see this film and if you have a boyfriend thank him... ,positive
 One should not be too critical about the director's second feature. I really like the camera work of Madiba. As Mr. Shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things. However howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images? Remember he has not got any education of any sort. I don't think english is the common tongue in Cape Town ghettos. Worse still Madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14. Any way if you overcome above-mentioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work. ,positive
 One of the finest movies I have viewed...Good script original plot of a man who is haunted about JFK's assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that Cold November day in 1963. Thirty years later another anti-social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner along the way to the crazed gunmen who schemes lies and murders anybody in his path who'll stand in his way of his mission. The movie accompanies with a great memorable score and a restrained but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood....which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. Malchovich is great sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played but how many could acted with such craftiness and intellect that he displayed in the movie? Needless to say I thought this was a great movie...everytime it's on television I have to watch it..and I own it on dvd! I'm a big Eastwood fan this only boosted his already fabulous career and Malchovich's best role to date! ,positive
 What a wonderful film filled with eccentric unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast. The director also did a great job keeping the story held together getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. S. Epatha in the lead role is great. I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is and although I have enjoyed her on Law and Order this really shows what she can do with a filled out complex role. Macy Gray is terrific Mos Def as usual wonderful. Lou Gossett great. Jimmy Smits terrific and doesn't try to pull focus because he's a star. A true piece of ensemble acting. Rent it enjoy it groove to it and treasure it. Something special. ,positive
 Good Lord... How this ended up in our DVD player I'll never know...my wife thought it was a new release she'd missed somehow...Nevermind it's a couple of years old and in Danish ( I think)... She kept looking for the English soundtrack... All in all...the film wasn't bad... Good production values better performances and a clever story that doesn't get too far away from itself make for tidy dark-humored fare from across the sea! The ending will make you chuckle...in fact the whole film will. Incredibly strange characters that we grow genuinely interested in make a film that might be worth your while...Without spoiling the plot the film's title and DVD jacket give you a good idea where this thing is going! ,positive
 As an adult I am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when I was a teen. During the time I was experiencing familial problems. This particular movie managed to capture what I was seeing from a closeted world. How much peer pressure is too much? I actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience. How far might an individual go for social acceptance? Who is the bad crowd? Teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions but ultimately...who is the pack leader if there must be one? Is it the strong? The beautiful? Perhaps the person we just all seem to like? Could it be the moral character? As far as the movie goes the cast worked together as if it were predestined. I only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me. I wish I could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more. ,positive
 by the way it looks at the other comments made it seems that a lot of people did not get the point to the flick. It is not centered around zombies as a matter of fact they are not zombies at all they are a device regenerated by the wizard to scare the girls to death his main focus is on Meg Tilly who he wants to help him finish the job that he died while doing in the first place and what you get is a great flick with an awesome ending it is hard to find on video but every once in a while it shows up on HBO or Cinamax check it out I gave it a 10 and highly recommend it. ,positive
 I have this movie on a collection of inexpensive B-movies. It's not restored in fact the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes. At first it seemed like a typical haunted house film and feels very much like the forerunner of Clue Murder by Death House on Haunted Hill etc. About a half hour into the film the storyline takes a really interesting twist--and it goes from being a cliché melodrama to something entirely different and far more entertaining than I had initially thought. Check it out it's a great deal of fun even if the long clips and wider shots (and near lack of music score) make it feel a bit creaky by today's standards. ,positive
 Out to Sea is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This film is not quite as funny as their Grumpy Old Men comedies (which it strongly resembles) but there are many laughs throughout. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws who take a cruise together. Once they get on the boat the thing Lemmon doesn't know is that Matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon who's in no mood to dance. What's worse Matthau doesn't even know how to dance. Nevertheless they go along with it and it the process they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members. Here are the crew members: there's the cruise director Gil Godwyn played to the hilt by Star Trek: The Next Generation veteran Brent Spiner who acts like an evil dictator. There's two fellow dance hosts played by Barney Miller star Hal Linden and veteran movie musical star Donald O'Connor. There's the ship's owner Mrs. Carruthers played by Golden Girl Rue McClanahan. As for the passengers: there's Vivian a widow played by Gloria De Haven who falls in love with Lemmon. There's Liz played by one of my all-time favorite actresses Dyan Cannon who falls in love with Matthau. There's Mavis Liz's mother played by veteran stage actress Elaine Stritch. And they meet others as well. All these actors are a pleasure to watch as Lemmon and Matthau play off of them. It's great to see Cannon here see's beautiful as ever; Stritch is a hoot; Spiner is a funny comic villain who's plays it deadly straight; De Haven is wonderful; Linden O'Connor and McClanahan have a good moment or two; and finally the two main stars Lemmon and Matthau are fine as usual. A nice little gem of a comedy. *** (out of four) ,positive
 A fine performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful one by Jean-Hugues Anglade adorn this stange tale of lust desire and alienation in France. The work of the two lead performers is striking--subtle intense and passionate. Alas the script is deliberately turgid and sordid and the overall effect leaves one with a downcast spirit. Still those who can appreciate fine quality acting will be able to savor the courageous work of the leads in this often difficult film journey of Gallic low life. ,positive
 This film is on my top 20 comedies list. This is a truly unique film. To the reviewer who said I must be really missing something. --you are correct. You are missing something. If you don't have the kind of sense of humor this film requires that's one thing. But don't give it a bad review because you think it's looney but isn't intended to be. Loony is an apt description of both what it intends to be and what it succeeds in being. I laughed much more often and much more intensely at this film than I do at most other funny films. Michael Almereyda brought out the best in his cast in this his first big film for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit award for Best First Feature. Crispin Glover as usual is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way and some of his very funniest lines ever were said in this film. Glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now. Harry Dean Stanton puts in an excellent comic performance. William Burroughs is incredible in a small role. Dylan McDermott was ideally cast and Lois Chiles is completely excellent. All of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way but this is one of Crispin's finest performances--up there with his performances in River's Edge and Willard. If you are a Crispin Glover fan but have somehow overlooked this film you need to stop whatever it is you're doing and see this immediately. But just remember to relax first and maybe have a beer or something. This is a great film but it is very unusual and I recommend being in or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before viewing. ,positive
 This comment discusses North and South Book I dealing with 1842-1861 period The 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures there were people who adapted that time onto screen. D.W. Griffith in the early 1900s made his unforgettable BIRTH OF A NATION. Yet the most famous film about the north-south clash is still I suppose GONE WITH THE WIND (1938). Unfortunately fewer people know the magnificent TV series based on John Jakes' novel North and South. It is the very best TV series ever made and the time spent on watching it is really precious. I taped it on my video from Polish TV many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since then. Why? Firstly the entire story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families the Maines from South Carolina and the Hazards from Pennsylvania represent two entirely different ways of life. In spite of that friendship unites them. Yet what they experience is the struggle all people do: friendship attacked by truth of political correctness love attacked by hatred of legal spouses gentleness by strength of social heroes . Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and who is quickly deprived of her; someone who cares for friends but political fanatics step in the way and ruin much. Finally he is someone who can see the tragic future for his land but there is nothing he can do about the south's inescapable fate. His friend George Hazard is similar in most aspects but sometimes he appears to have a stronger character. It is him who shows Orry that although there are tragedies he must get up from despair and live since life is the most precious thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles their friendship occurs to be stronger than any prejudice politics or conflicts. Other characters are also particularly well developed. There are villains like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones who are really wicked but most of the people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Maine is at first full of rebellion prone to fighting later however he learns to be a true southern gentleman for whom southern pride is not courageous words but foremost courageous deeds. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical side of abolitionist movement striving to condemn slavery and punish the owners of black breeding farms. Her marriage with Grady appears to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying NO to the politics of the south. Two interesting characters are Orry's sisters Brett and Ashton - sisters in whose veins runs entirely opposite blood. Brett in her gentleness but also naiveness believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy even though he is a northerner because she truly loves him. Brett is the representation of all that is precious in any young woman. Ashton however is a vamp a tigress a woman who does not hesitate to do the most wicked things. The clear picture of their world views clash is their chat about men and family...unforgettable moment and how universal! Most characters head for their values...yet war breaks out and they'll have to put aside a lot... Secondly the performances... someone said that not all people act naturally. I wouldn't say that. I'd rather say that all cast do very good jobs in their parts from the main characters who are portrayed by younger staff to the guests that consist of famous stars including Liz Taylor Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a great job. I consider this role one of his best ones. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Her part perhaps entails too much suffering but she manages to express all sorts of feelings really well. Kirstie Alley is very appealing and truly memorable as the abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff is worth consideration as horribly ambitious Elkanah Bent as well as David Carradine as a monster husband disgusting Justin LaMotte. And in contrast to him a mention must be made of Jean Simmons who is truly excellent as Orry's mother whose heart beats for the glory of family life and concord of union. Thirdly memorable moments of North and South leave an unfading trace in one's mind. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - what charm what gentleness there is in this scene! Or is it possible to skip the moment when Madeleine's father dies? I found it really powerful there is a real drama in this moment a drama of a woman being left by someone who really loved her. I also liked Churubusco sequence and George Hazard so worried about the life of his dearest friend Orry. Then his meetings with Constance are terrific. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. And the final moment of the first part: although North and South may separate their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically join hands as the train moves on. Simply there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it's impossible to mention even half of them here. And these gorgeous tunes by Bill Conti and shot in brilliant landscapes. The music in North and South is very touching and memorable. What to say in the end? North and South is a real must have on DVD simply an amazing TV series about the victory of all that is precious in us: love friendship loyalty honor truthfulness absolute fidelity. 9/10 ,positive
 What can I say?? This movie has it all...Romance break-ups rich kids punks and preps. This is my all time favorite movie that I can recite line for line....I remember when it first came out I was 14 and couldn't get in....so finally got to see it on cable... I was hooked! Wanted to move to California and be a Valley Girl.. (Hey I even remember the song by Moon Zappa do you?) Tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack...now you can find it on rhino records.... ,positive
 Am I the only person who believes this American version is far better than the 1934 English film? The English version has no suspense looks antique and very low budget and has unexceptional acting (except for Peter Lorre). The 1956 version besides having top production values shows James Stewart as the perfect 'innocent' American abroad and gives Doris Day her best role ever. Of particular note is the music - the music of the American film is almost classic; compare the Albert Hall' sequences of both and you will agree that the Bernard Herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version (even though it's basically the same music!). The only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop. I would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the English version is better. ,positive
 An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins comes the Following a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. One man he follows he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for. Using a cast of non-actors and his uncle writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently this movie is much more than you'd expect. For anyone who likes Memento and complex twists turns shocks and messing around with time this is definitely a movie for you. ,positive
 So many early British sound films that I've seen on video suffer from either poor print transfer quality or poor sound or both. Fortunately I was able to obtain a copy of this movie on a video of excellent quality enabling me to focus on the story itself. And an excellent story it was. At first sight the passengers on the ill-fated bus looked like a pretty boring lot (except for the always lovely Jessie Matthews). But as the film went back to show each passenger's story on the day before the accident I discovered that the cast contrary to initial appearance was a talented group of performers skillfully directed so as to bring a real individuality to their distinctive characterizations. Viewers may have different preferences as to which two passengers are going to meet a tragic end and which ones will survive. But the movie holds your interest as it keeps you guessing. This film deserves a much wider audience - a real gem of early British Cinema. ,positive
 One night barkeeper Randy (Matt Dillon) rescues Jewel (Liv Tyler) from her jealous boyfriend Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). He takes Jewel to his home. But Utah comes back and wants Randy to open the safe at Mc Cool´s. Suddenly a shot - Utah´s dead. Then... ...I´ll better stop here to tell the plot. That´s like to explain the story of Wild things . What I found so interesting was the fact that the plot (written by Stan Seidel his first and his last work - he died in July last year...) was told from 3 perspectives - the 3 men that fall for Jewel. Everybody of them sees her from different eyes - like John Goodman as the detective who tenderly falls in love with her because of being remembered of his dead wife... No wonder that the guys fall for her! Liv Tyler - she´s a real jewel. She made the big screen shining! She played her role as if she was in a 40´s noir- thriller. Sweet - but in the same time she was the cool vamp who walks over dead body´s and uses the men for her needs. And of course Michael Douglas. How could I forget him? Mr. Burmeister the Bingo-playing killer - he was quite cool! But in the last 10 minutes there was a little bit too much slapstick for my taste - it weakened the atmosphere. That part began when Paul Reiser (as Randys cousin Carl) putted on his leather dress for Jewel. The YMCA -song didn´t fit so much here... ... but altogether One night at Mc Cool´s is a pretty COOL film-noir parody! ,positive
 This movie is apparently intended for a young evangelical Christian audience as a teaching tool. For that I give it a 7 out of 10 point vote. It's a decent movie to show a youth group but I don't think it will be very well received beyond that. For any other audience I'd rate it lots lower. The reviewers that saw It's a Wonderful Life in this were right on though I didn't think of that until they mentioned it. I was more reminded of a Chick Tract those little 3 by 5 gospel comic books. If Jack Chick ever made a movie out of one of his tracts it would probably look a lot like Second Glance. It has a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence each of us has on earth but it is somewhat hampered by Christian stereotypes. The Christians are all very nice somewhat passive and squeaky clean while all of the non-Christians seem to be bad people. Muriel the angel plays a major part and he is the corniest cheesiest character in the film. He is the most unlikeable angel I have ever seen in any movie and the biggest negative. I don't know if the directors intended for his personality to come off so badly or if he just struck me that way. (I admit that he reminded me of someone I know.) Dan's love for a very worldly girl who is not at all his type drives the plot in this movie. Why he ever fell for her in the first place is the one question that I wish had been answered. But the movie does display positive Christian values and your youth group will be entertained as they view something wholesome with a good lesson. ,positive
 I'm torn about this show. While MOST parts of it I found to be HILARIOUS other parts of it I found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake. The off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children. However I don't think it's clever getting little children to say rude things. It's not that I think oh poor children they're being exploited - it's just that it's really not clever!! It's something that ANYONE could do therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane. In order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural responses from children which I think can be funnier than the scripted at time. By far the funniest part of Wonder Showzen is Clarence the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers. It's really funny and it's mostly improvised. Seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an EXTREMELY patient man was by far the funniest scene in my opinion. You should watch this show though because all in all it's very funny even if it is stupid at times. ,positive
 ...this one. What came to my mind immediately was Loving Annabelle as it has this same kind of mature mood and distanced dealing with the subject. We simply observe as the story unfolds without taking sides or having to confront any moral issues (or of course we are but are not spoon-fed them). Sure there were some difficult facts to face and choices to make but it just flowed. Basically it was just like any other love story in any other life with any other sexes. I personally found the girls having a good chemistry and had fun with them on their night outs. The only thing i could really pinpoint as a problem would be it just felt kind of...retained. Held back. It's not about the sex scenes (or those missing) but given that i felt the film at its liveliest during the moments they were together having a good time it kind of contrasted with the rest. Lowkey is good but it just never quite sizzled like Loving Annabelle nor touched me quite as much. This said i heartily recommend it it's by no means a waste of ones precious time on the contrary... 7/10 ,positive
 Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War) spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which if crossed would lead to open conflict with the Romulans although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh. Soon enough a Romulan vessel appears carrying a new weapon and a cloaking device which makes it nearly impossible to defeat. Facing the threat of imminent annihilation Kirk must engage in a battle of wits with the Romulan Commander (Mark Lenard) to ensure the survival of his crew. Unfortunately the task is made more difficult when one of the men accuses Spock of being in league with the enemy due to the physical resemblance between Romulans and Vulcans two races that are in fact distantly related (a fact that is quite ironic with hindsight given Lenard went on to play Spock's father Sarek starting with Season 2). Always very critical when it came to the subject of war Star Trek enjoys one of its finest hours with its most gripping and tense take on the topic. Although the Romulans aren't actually based on the Soviets (the name is actually taken from Romulus the founder of Rome) the scenario is quite obviously inspired by the very vivid fear American and Russian citizens had at the time that either nation might be able to destroy the other with nuclear weapons (that fear gave birth to the titular concept of balance of terror ). But even without the subtext this remains an essential episode due for the most part to the intellectual battle between the two adversaries which translates into a thesping duel between Shatner and Lenard. No need to say who wins... ,positive
 I was very surprised to learn that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this film. She seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by the 54(!) year old Bergman in the scenes where they are side by side. If it had been written today I think that Bergman and the young man Ivan would have wound up together (Ingrid is so much hotter than Goldie...) and the two self-absorbed characters played by Matthau and Hawn would be left out in the cold. But it was written at the end of 60's and feels like Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the Park. However Matthau's one-liners Hawn's innocence and Bergman's classy performance make this quite pleasant to watch. ,positive
 What can i say about Tromeo and Juliet other than if you like twisted Troma machinations then you MUST see this movie! This is my absolute favorite Troma flick and i have seen almost all of them! Penis monsters cecsarian births to live rats and popcorn lesbianism steamy sex scenes in plexiglass boxes incest nipple piercing dismemberment shameless Troma plugs and computer masturbation...How can one go wrong? It amazingly follows the original story very closely. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! OH and speaking of shameless plugs...Check out Jane Jensen's Comic Book Whore CD on Interscope records. It is awesome! ,positive
 The Beguiled is a pretty satisfying film for those who are after the things above. For Clint Eastwood's die-hard fans it will be a disappointment. Although Eastwood does his best here in his so atypical role (except for the fact that his character is a charming womanizer which he isn't so unacquainted with) the ambiguous nature of his character which goes from being a sort of fallen hero to a manipulative and insatiable woman eater (to put it that way) will eventually be too much to handle for anyone used to see him play heroes in the best western tradition morally a bit unclean but still without that dark side. I think he manages to pull this unlikely part off but those who really steal the show are the two rivalising women the schoolmistress Geraldine Page and the head of the students played by Elizabeth Hartman. We see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. Hartman's Edwina is the sweetest most innocent girl in the world until she becomes infatuated with John McBurney and becomes possessive of him. This is what causes tragedy as well as the headmistress' secret lust the forbidden fruit. She carries a great and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother whom she clearly idolizes still. The fourth factor in this unholy love spiral is the wicked Carol played by Jo Ann Harris who lures John away from his crush on Edwina and into her bed. The whole nature of the story gives this film a sort of Gothic feel which makes it a pretty rare thing in the Western genre but a popular thing in the movies of the 70's. A unique achievement by the Siegel/Eastwood team and a movie not for the faint hearted. ,positive
 I just watched the DVD version of BORN BAD and found it to be tense gritty and near the end too graphic for the faint of heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman turn in superior performances. For a low budget film this picture delivers. The depth of character and clever dialogue are two things not usually seen in a Roger Corman picture. Check it out on DVD! ,positive
 I learned a thing: you have to take this film like a funny period comedy if you don't want to be disappointed. The film's enjoyable because it's a delicious comedy. I think the over-hype damaged it: the too much glorified Monica Bellucci appears in few scenes and isn't so good as they wanted to let you believe. She sounds unnatural false: the best actress in this film is Sabrina Impacciatore who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines together with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very very good: the most promising young Italian actor according to me. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon but I preferred other actors. So the most hyped performances were also the worst. Costumes and production design are okay: sure American period movies are more accurate about these things because have bigger budgets but the Italian ability rewards the lack of money. A nice period comedy in short with a first-rate casting (except for Bellucci and Auteuil). ,positive
 Ugh what an embarrassing episode last night! It was either a failed script for ABC Afterschool Special or the product of an earnest rookie writer just out of college making an homage to that classic PC anti-gun homily from 1974 The Gun . In fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of The Gun being melted down like in the movie! No I'm not some NRA shill. It's just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that I should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal Cause I'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2-by-4. Geez! OK the sociology lesson is over. The Message has been delivered. The Important Episode has been aired. Now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence. ,positive
 Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach Ian Charleson Urbano Barberini Daria Nicolodi Review: The only other Argento movie I had seen was Suspiria and that one blew me away with its style colors and spooky story line. I next decided to go with Opera as I had been told it was one of his best. Man I think I'm discovering what will ultimately be one of my favorite horror directors. Opera is about a young opera singer who gets her big break when the main star of a creepy modern opera take on Mc Beth gets hit by a car. Betty is the understudy so she gets to do the part herself. Too bad for her there's a psycho after her who makes her watch the brutal murders of her friends and co-workers. Wow Id heard good things about this here flick but I wasn't prepared for the level of greatness to which this film would take me. Yeah the movie has its shortcomings to which Ill get to later. But for the most part the movie blew me away. First off this movie is not as filled with lots of colors as Suspiria. I was expecting it to be a bit like suspiria in that department but no to my surprise it had its own look and feel. The film is somehow devoid of color. It does have lots in colors in certain scenes (like the masterful kitchen/living room sequence) where Argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues but for the most part the film has a grayish black tone to it all through out and I liked that it had its own distinctive look. The real stars of this show are the incredibly well orchestrated death sequences. Wow. Every death scene was like a work of art. Beauty in destruction. These are not just your typical hack and slash death sequences these deaths were carefully constructed to shock and get the most out of its situations. Loved every second of them there's plenty of blood and mayhem here but with style. Not gonna spoil em though. Then there's the direction. Man there's some really original and beautiful shots on this one. I loved the inventive use of the camera on this one. You thought that Tarantinos shot in Kill Bill vol. 1 where we see the bullet coming out of the chamber of the gun was original? Well this is the movie he lifted it from! I honestly believe that Tarantino was heavily influenced by this specific movie with certain scenes in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Heck in the making of feature he mentions that the whole scene with Beatrix in the hospital and Elle Driver coming to kill her was influenced by Italian Giallos and here my friends is the proof of that. Anyhows Tarantino references aside this movie has some amazing camera shots like those scenes of the crows flying through the crowd in the opera house...great stuff. And a main reason why Argentos becoming one of my favorites. The acting from most of the cast was alright but the best by far was Cristina Marsillach as the tortured young opera singer Betty. The looks in her eyes as the murders were being committed were great. The rest of the cast was a little wooden and stiff but nothing that would deter your enjoyment of the film. There were very few things I didn't like about this movie. First off logic was thrown out the window in certain scenes. Specially those involving Bettys reactions after shes seen the murders. It seem to me that for the longest time she just went on about her business not telling anyone about the whole thing. Not even the police. I mean if you see someone brutally murder a loved one in front of your eyes...you don't just walk away from the murder scene and continue with your life. Someone would have connected her to the murders. She might have even become a suspect herself...but no. Also the ending is a bit anti climactic. You'll have to see this to understand but it seemed a bit unnecessary the way the film ended it felt like it could have ended earlier. It would not have felt so redundant. But thats about it not real big problems for me really since I was enjoying the rest of this beautiful film. I've still got a lot of Argento territory to cover...but I'm devouring every step of the way like if I was eating a plate of the most expensive caviar. This guys really good. I think of his films as works of art and I've only seen two of em! Cant wait to discover the rest of his films. Argento you the man! Rating: 41/2 out of 5 ,positive
 I was one of the few who went out of my way to see this in the theater. I've thought about it frequently ever since. After two DVD viewings I'm glad to say it held up perfectly. Like any great comedy I laughed more on each viewing both in anticipation of gags but also after catching things missed before. Mike Judge does very well with creating insanely comedic characters and fitting them into their world so they make sense. In Office Space the environment make the characters believable. Idiocracy's future gives him liberty to write unbelievably dumb characters and make them work. I'll be waiting to see if they release a better DVD with some actual features before buying it. But this movie deserves the support on DVD not offered to it at the theater. ,positive
 I had before a feeling of mislike for all Russian films. But after seeing this film I haven´t. This is a unique masterpiece made by the best director ever lived in the USSR. He knows the art of film making and can use it very well. If you find this movie: buy or copy it! ,positive
 Hit and Run is a shattering story starring the always wonderful Margaret Colin as a society lady who has it all until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene. Hence the title. The tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns but is frightened away by angry passers-by who think the hitter abandoned the scene. This was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story. Colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away. Her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self-loathing hole causing her to make a bad situation worse. This is a very thought-provoking story and one can't help but to feel this lady's pain wishing throughout that she would simply come clean. As a TV movie thanks to Colin and a strong script this is a well above average TV movie. ,positive
 I wasn't expecting much because of the harsh reviews and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result. Softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films in my opinion allowed the narrative to take the focus. Though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace I felt like many of the other things were not. For example: how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her. the very strong and well acted love scenes. the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more. Their strong differences of what it means to be 'vampire' created by their prior life experiences. the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie. I've heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other films'. Of course. However i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I feel that he does this well. I don't need a director to use new tricks. I prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately which i feel is the case with this film. I recommend it. ,positive
 I think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while. i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. The cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl. She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother. Best of all are the songs beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this move ya'll! especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'. Great songs both of them. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting (and superb songs! ). Cheers Simran. ,positive
 I've always liked Sean Connery but as James Bond I've always favored Roger Moore. Still it was Connery who set the Bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than James Bond the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of Spectre. And what designs they are in Never Say Never Again. SPECTRE with the help of a foolish young Air Force officer who happens to be Kim Bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now SPECTRE headed by Blofeld played here by Max Von Sydow is threatening blackmail of the world. Von Sydow's operations guy is Klaus Maria Brandauer who is also courting Bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side. And he's got a female assassin working for him in Barbara Carrera who makes Angelina Jolie as Nora Croft look like Mrs. Butterworth. But before Sean Connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'M' running things at British Intelligence. Edward Fox thinks Connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the British taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. I really did enjoy Fox's performance he's like the great grandson of Colonel Blimp. I also enjoyed Carrera she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. When she's scuba diving with Connery in the Bahamas note how she puts Mr. Shark on 007's case. Will Connery do James Bond again? He was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair. ,positive
 A year after her triumphant first special My Name Is Barbra Barbra Streisand regrouped with her production team to produce this follow-up CBS-TV special in then-revolutionary color. First broadcast in March 1966 Color Me Barbra follows a similar format to its predecessor - three segments the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the after-hours halls of the Philadelphia Museum of Art where dressed as a period maid she roams the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through song. In various guises Streisand expresses a variety of moods from the comedy schtick of the Minute Waltz to the melodrama of Non C'est Rien in a Modigliani painting to the beatnik-style frenzy of Gotta Move set to abstract art. My favorite moment in the special is when she transforms into a dead ringer of Queen Nefertiti while singing a haunting rendition of Rogers and Hart's Where or When . Opening with another comic monologue full of silly non-sequiturs this time in French the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly-colored circus medley where she interacts with animals including her beloved poodle Sadie. She finds an appropriate context for Sam You Made the Pants Too Long with a bevy of penguins and comically compares her profile to an anteater's with We Have So Much in Common . As with the first special the program ends with a riveting solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home Where Am I Going? and Starting Here Starting Now among them. Also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986 ironically dressed in all-white when the special was first released on VHS. The juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special and a 23-year old Streisand is in peak form. ,positive
 This film is about a young Indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman. The problem is that he is gay. In order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control. This film is hilarious and got me laughing many times. Sally Bankes' acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is outstanding as well. I find the plot very realistic and I can completely identify with Jimi's feeling of being terrified worried and upset. On the other hand Jimi's boyfriend Jack is given much less attention in the film. I would have liked him to be given more lines in the film and have more character development. However as I guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the film. It is great to watch a gay affirmative film. Furthermore this film preaches us to be accepting to other people's difference be it sexuality culture and the way of life. This film makes viewers think hard. We need films like this to give us a boost. Thanks for making this film! ,positive
 This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. I found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability this was represented in a great performance by both two Michael and Rory. Whether the story is based around a true story I feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human. On the whole this film reach into my soul and I too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity. The whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but I feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama. Certainly one not to be missed! ,positive
 I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. Sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from Rollin? Also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead bit more dodgey perhaps but most effective. There is also a sci-fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but I wouldn't bother too much with that. No here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still 'alive' without memory. My DVD sleeve mentions David Cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space. As I have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning railway setting at the end. ,positive
 While my kids enjoyed the movie (and announced afterward that they want to buy it later) I think I got more out of it that they did. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cutting comment aloud but I thought it). It is a feel good mid-life movie a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his Mom is dying?) but all in all and good time. It also gave our family something to talk about - did my kids think my life was boring? What do they expect at 40? How can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids? ,positive

 Rock Star is a nice movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice really are nice. Chris is a nice guy who learns a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily who is also nice. It's a good movie despite all the niceness. Maybe I'm just used to all the angst of the X Gen music. In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believable. Mark Wahlberg's acting is quite good. Jennifer Aniston played her role well but it was uncomplicated. She was a nice girl. Go see it. If you have ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap go see it. ,positive
 A friend of mine asked: Doesn't one have to be pro-euthanasia in order to like this movie? Is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to end their lives? Interesting questions. As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong) there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in The Sea Inside. Think Ramón Sampedro addressed this in the movie as well. It is he who wants to die. It is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death. He is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics. Though his pioneering work depending on one's perspective may prove beneficial or damaging to quadriplegics down the road his primary objective is a personal one. But one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway) is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth. After my first viewing of The Sea Inside I walked home in a conflicted blur. I struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion; why would Ramón want to die? Given the love care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on Ramón by the people surrounding him why would he doggedly cling on to his hurtful decision? Then on my second viewing a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness. It threw up a telling observation: ...total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy. Most human beings crave for such an intimacy. Of course how much we value such needs depends largely on the individual. As a person with a familial-biased sensibility I empathised strongly with the caregivers in this movie. Why can't Javier consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends? Is he blind to it all? I would think not. The miracle of The Sea Inside therefore is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war. When we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one whom has expressed a calm conscious and rational intent to die what then is the right thing to do? Is caring for and keeping this loved one alive against his or her will a pious gesture? Does it show up the worth of our love? Or does it merely soothe our selfish fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding accorded to caregivers wouldn't their invalid charges by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival also be an overlooked act of sacrifice? Rhetorical or not how much is dignity worth to an individual? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege or a right? If we really care and love a person should we also respect their eventual decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions the movie might have asked answers to which I'm in no position to provide. In our eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro-life or pro-choice we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that's engulfing the people most intimately affected the caregivers and the ones they care for. The Sea Inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively this film understands one thing; that the nature of sacrifice is never one-sided. In this tug of war we should endeavour not to win arguments but to intently observe and hopefully determine who is the stronger party to make that sacrifice. The Sea Inside is a sobering film. It opened my eyes to things I don't wanna see. And for that I am grateful. ,positive
 Clyde Bruckman borrows the premise of this short from Buster Keaton's Seven Chances recently tepidly remade as The Bachelor. In the original Buster has 24-hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money. In this version musical teacher Prof. Shemp has only 7 hours (After all it is a short!). This is one of the better Stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines (Including the telephone booth scene with Moe & Shemp reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy's Berth Marks and the Marx Brothers famous stateroom scene in Night At The Opera - here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine). I'm not a huge Stooges fan but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early 30s shorts. ,positive
 Where to Begin I like the scary snow-monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me we thought he'd be back and he was. Changing the local to a tropical resort works. Seeing old friends and meeting new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job as Jack Frost you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance. Yup Jack Frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first. I do have one complaint the little Jacks or the Jacklings as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings the mouth could have opened wider but the CGI was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again. If you liked JACK FROST then you will like this sequel. No questions or debate 9 BIG STARS. ,positive
 It's rare for a film to sweep you away within its world and leave you wanting more once the credits roll. Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a film. The film is the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo who wishes to become human. She swims to shore and is found by a young boy named Sasuke who promises to take care of her. Course Ponyo's father an ecologically obsessed sorcerer named Fujimoto tries to keep Ponyo from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature which is eventually upturned when Ponyo finally transforms into a little girl causing a massive typhoon. Ponyo is a very rich film. It is full of wondrous fantasy lovable characters and genuine heart. What director Hayao Miyazaki has done here is tell a simple little story and while so doing creating authentic movie magic. Ponyo is an enchanting experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. As well the environmentalist within Miyazaki is still as evident within this film as in all his previous works. Miyazaki shows the filth and grime that fall into the ocean in an almost startling light not to mention Ponyo's father is on an obsessive mission to clean the world's oceans. While the story is simple Miyazaki manages to add this extra layer to provoke thought with expert proficiency. The film is a beautiful work of art each hand drawn cell looks like a wondrous pastel painting. The film looks very different than many other Studio Ghibli productions but the artistry is still just as spectacular as ever before. The scenes underwater are simply beautiful to watch Fujimoto's fortress under the sea is highly inventive and the sequence where Ponyo runs across the jumping fish within the typhoon to reach Sosuke is iconic. Course it is thanks to its wonderfully executed characters that makes this film such a memorable experience. Sosuke is a young boy who acts older than he actually is and the energetic Ponyo is a laugh a minute. Every character is just so enjoyable and highly memorable. Overall Ponyo is a wondrous experience enchanting in every single way. While the film may be sold as a children's fairy tale I believe many adults will be swept away within its fantastic world along with their children. While the film may lack the density of some of Miyazaki's previous works here he keeps it pure and simple being true to himself delivering a film that is funny heartwarming and entertaining all in one. This is a magnificent film. I give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10! ,positive
 **SPOILERS AHEAD** It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be such a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés and that it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with your husband? To the French: would you really ask about someone being à la fac when you know they don't speak French? Wouldn't you use a more common word like université ? I lived in France for a while and I sort of do know and understand Europe (and I love it) but my (German) roommate and I found this pretty insulting overall. It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament and it tried too hard basically. It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together (not a bad thing in itself) but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous--too many clashes that wouldn't really happen. Then the end of the movie--the last 10 minutes--ruined all the rest. Why doesn't Xavier talk to the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris? Why does he just walk off? Why does he just run away from his job is that freedom ? And in the end is the new Europe supposed to rest on a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day? Is this what it's made up of? Besides the acting was pretty horrible. I can't believe Judith Godrèche's role and acting. Why was she made to look like Emanuelle Béart so much? At first I thought Xavier was OK but with retrospect I think he was pretty bad. And that's all really too bad because technically (opening credits scenes when he's asking what papers he needs) it was really good (except for sound editing around the British siblings) and the soundtrack was great too. So the form was good but the content pretty horrible. ,positive
 In an early scene Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago admiring the bucolic architecture when a woman angrily arguing in French on a cell phone passes by them prompting James to remark There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman. A few blocks later they pass an old Filipino woman also angry also arguing on a cell phone and Luca remarks for referential effect There's nothing hotter than an angry elderly Filipino woman. The humor in Jeff Garlin's I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is best characterized by the word quotidian. The film is a conversation. We might as well be eavesdropping. Rather than go for antics the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs. While it's not innovative it is far from banal and even if James views himself as being rather jejune we know that he is fairly average and this endears him. Self-betterment is the primary theme of the movie. Sarah Silverman who plays Beth is excellent as the catalyst of change; she revitalizes James and so reminds him to live a better life. Even so achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters but rather something simpler: that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on. A movie about life lessons can be overwrought as it can forget to connect with its audience. I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is subtle and winsome and while its moral may not be inspiring it is still resonant. This is low-key comedy but it will stick with you. ,positive

 The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker Jr. He's a young gun who with partner David Carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a Mexican general. In eluding their pursuers Carradine and Walker become separated. Walker comes upon the camp of lawman Robert Mitchum who takes a liking to Walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts. This is the first of two films Robert Mitchum did with writer/director Burt Kennedy. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. Not that Young Billy Young does not have its moments of hilarity. But it is a tripartite story involving the Walker reclamation Mitchum's hunt for the bad who killed his son and a romantic triangle involving Mitchum Angie Dickinson and town boss Jack Kelly. The film abounds with nepotism. David Carradine is John's son. Dean Martin's daughter Deana is in this Walker is the son of Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and Mitchum's son Chris plays Mitchum's son in some silent flashbacks. Robert Mitchum got his start in westerns and always looks right at home in them. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in Rio Bravo. Walker had a brief career playing rebellious youths and doing a good job at it. I've often wondered what happened to him. He looks hauntingly like his father. Maybe he didn't want to come to such a tragic early end like his father. And it that wasn't enough Mitchum fans get to hear old rumple eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film. ,positive
 The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct and is looking for his 1st big chance. He discovers Molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. He signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. And oh yes there's romance and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. The music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. Lots of DVD extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. It must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st not just a tribute to silent films. Later years would bring similar films such as Singin' in the Rain(1952) & Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner's The Comic(1969). What is special about this film though is recreating silent movies in 1939. We see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era(although some sound effects are included)in glorious b&w while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. One of the greatest in the silent era Buster Keaton who at this point was on an uphill climb is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game! It is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. But the real reason to watch the movie if your a motion picture history fan is that beyond everything else Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennett's film legacy. It doesn't take a genius to realize this movie is a positive reworking of Mack Sennett's and Mabel Normand's life. The character Michael Linnett Connors is Mack Sennett whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly of course is Mabel. Sennett had the pie throwings the bathing beauties and Keystone Cops. He worked with Buster Keaton Ben Turpin(cameo) Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle(body double) and fell in love with his leading lady. Not only all that but Sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well. As most film viewers today prefer sound features those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture. As Mack Sennett fell into that category it is fortunate that there is Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies. His career started in 1908 as an actor then writer director & producer. He semi retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit. He had worked with the best such as Charlie Chaplin Gloria Swanson Bing Crosby W.C. Fields Keaton Harry Langdon Arbuckle and even Roy Rogers(in Way Up Thar).As film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career Mack played it wise & did only selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work. In the 1940's his presence was still felt e.g. Here Come the Co-Eds(1945)where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in Mack's Wandering Willies(1926)is done. In 1947 The Road to Hollywood used some of Sennett's Crosby films. 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film Down Memory Lane in which he participated. With his knack of always associating with the right people a guest role with the eternally popular Lawrence Welk & his radio show came about later in the year. 1950 brought a re-release of his greatest triumph Tillie's Punctured Romance(1914) with sound. In 1952 he was honored on TV's This Is Your Life then his autobiography The King of Comedy(1954) which is a great companion piece to Hollywood Cavalcade was published. 1955 brought a more concrete association with Abbott & Costello as he had a cameo in A&C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally in 1957 another tribute with the compilation film The Golden Age of Comedy. So when you watch Hollywood Cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer. In the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table. As we get to the silver haired Mack he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say here I am! . When he rises to give a speech a short while later he is at his most subdued underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey I know my influence on comedy will never end but will people forget Mack Sennett the individual. Maybe this movie will help.  ,positive
 This is a film that everyone who lives in Sweden should watch. The film shows the political riots who took place in Gothenburg in 2001 from a new perspective. It features interviews with those who were convicted where those people gets the first chance after the riots to tell their side of the story and why they think the world can be a so much better place to live in and be a part of. I react emotionally when I see this since I just feel so mad about how those people were treated both during the riots but also after the riots. I hope as many as possible gets to see this movie as it really gets your mind thinking: Is this possible? In Sweden a democracy in 2001? ,positive

 Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman Signior Ferrari Mr. Peters Jerome K. Arbutny Ex-Superintendent Grodman Count Fosco Titus Semple) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact he actually did make four comedy appearances (one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance). His best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher Alexander Yardley in Christmas In Connecticut (although his autocratic half-mad soap tycoon in The Hucksters is a close second). Despite some problems with the screenplay it is a good film and usually revived in the Christmas season. Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) writes a column in American Housekeeping magazine for Yardley where she gives household tips and cooking recipes. She is the 1945 version of Martha Steward except that Ms Steward is a cook and house-owner and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates. Stanwyck can't. Her cooking recipes are those of her friend Felix (S.Z. Sakall) a gourmet chef and restaurateur. The house she describes as her home (a model farmhouse in Connecticut) belongs to her unofficial boyfriend architect John Sloan (Reginald Gardiner). Gardiner really would not mind marrying Stanwyck but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to him. As the film begins an American is shipwrecked by the Nazis. This is Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan) a sailor. He spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued. Sensing publicity value Greenstreet decides to grant Morgan's wish to have a genuine old fashioned Christmas in Connecticut. He basically tells Stanwyck that she will entertain Morgan and himself at her farm for the holidays. Stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself (complete with her ability to flip flap-jacks and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband) is a lie - if she does she will be fired as will her immediate boss Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne). In a moment of depression she accepts Gardiner's proposal of marriage and then Gardiner finds his Connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the actual home of Stanwyck and himself and their baby . Of course aside from putting off Greenstreet's meddling curiosity Stanwyck and Morgan find that they are falling in love (much to the annoyance of Gardiner - he does actually expect that Stanwyck will still marry him). Complication following complication occurs as lies piles on lies and as neighbor's babies succeeds neighbor's babies before Greenstreet begins to wonder if he is missing something. But it is a comedy so everything works out well. Even Greenstreet at the conclusion is amused by the entire madness - his celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of Santa Clause for a change. This is not a classic comedy certainly not a great one but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in December. ,positive
 If it were possible to award a 10+ .... this would be the one film I would choose. I remember catching this film on TV many many years ago - and fortunately being prepared enough to video it. Now my video copy is getting old video technology is outdated and I'm starting to worry that I may not be able to enjoy the delights of this movie for much longer. As a wildlife film it is superb. As a film about the relationship between man and nature it surpasses anything screened before or since. How can the film industry allow such a classic to go unnoticed and forgotten? If such a thing as a lobby/pressure group exists to push for the re-release of this film count me in and send me the details pronto. My guess is there's a mint to be made by anyone able to re-release this in today's market. ,positive
 They just don't make cartoons like they used to. This one had wit great characters and the greatest ensemble of voice over artists ever assembled for a daytime cartoon show. This still remains as one of the highest rated daytime cartoon shows and one of the most honored winning several Emmy Awards. ,positive
 Flipping through the channels I was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie. I must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately. I love older films and this is or should be considered a classic! One of the most wonderful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie! ,positive
 Most of the criticism of Attack of Show is from people who are unfairly comparing it to an old computer TV program called The Screen Savers. People are upset because G4 decided to cancel the Screen Savers and replace it with the pop culture based Attack of the Show. To compare the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges! Attack of the Show is a unique hour long program that covers current Generation X/Y culture. It features segments on movies/television panel discussions video games new DVD releases sex advice new gadgets (MP3 players cell phones etc) comic books/graphic novels magazines and internet fads. It's a fun show definitely worth checking out you are in your 20s or 30s. I give it an 8 out of 10. ,positive
 Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is about to get married. Then one of his former students wins an Oscar for a film in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks Howard in his acceptance speech outing him as being gay too! This film follows the aftermath as reporters descend on Howard's village and he tries to convince everyone that he is straight. I love this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful it has some really hilarious moments and it always leaves me feeling great with an enormous grin on my face. Consequently it's one film that I enjoy watching as often as possible. If you haven't seen it you're missing out! ,positive
 This isn't far away from the trash that Bollywood normally makes but there's just something really good about it. The title song is one of Bollywoods best and is haunting throughout. This is one of the films (along with Baazigar - a must see Bollywood film) that made Shah Rukh Khan and it's for this you have to check it out. Other reviews give away the story - it is a fairly basic idea - ShaRukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star. Its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to Bollywood or not! 8/10 ,positive
 The entire series not just The Blue Planet is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system. The amount of time and effort put into capturing these shots is very much apparent when you sit down and watch this series. A must see for everyone. ,positive
 A lecture over the life of the tormented magician named Ray Charles. His pulses on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting cool tunes. Each barrier that Ray was facing never kept him down and he found his way all over conflicts. A real lesson. A great team of producers help recreate the era and armed with great costumes hairs and settings one will follow Ray's story believing its true direct filming! An icy music freezes and goosebumps the audience with clever sound editing. But the most important part of the movie is Jamie Foxx. His acting is really superb the most diamond polished acting ever seen. He lives his role. He is the Ray of Light. ,positive
 I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest this is a great film. Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star as Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to publish Origin of Species . Their consideration of the ramifications it may have for their family and the future of humankind are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off-screen couple could achieve. Jon Amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and John Collee do and excellent job of bringing Randal Keynes' biography to life. They created some very poignant and human moments great cinematography and sets and a generous helping of tongue-in-cheek about the still divisive theory of evolution. The surprise star is Martha West who plays Annie Darwin the character around whom much of the story unfurls. She plays the precocious young girl to a tee. If this performance is anything to go by her star should be on the rise. All in all a great film and although it is a period drama the issues that drive it are still very much alive today. ,positive
 I was enchanted by Niami's debut. I hope that we'll soon see more of his work. I was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief NYC run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown 80s flicks as Desperately Seeking Susan and After Hours but with a gentle European whimsey that made it fresh and fun. A strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure. And I thought the complexly inter-threaded plots were just right. Sandra Bernhard puts in her best performance since King of Comedy while Peter Stormare is hilarious and Ling Bai touching. See it. ,positive
 Honestly at first I watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes I heard it possesses but by actually watching the film it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there. Truly it is one of the most well-crafted and touching movies I've ever watched. I'm a teenage bisexual and the film spoke to me about my predicaments - sex religion love acceptance etc. It gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who I am. Cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling dozes of heart-warming lines and a bit of sexuality in it. It made the movie more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain but I don't agree myself. Brokeback Mountain has more drama while Latter Days is well-balanced. ,positive
 When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with David O. Selznick ended because of this. Actually he made some really good films in the period such as NOTORIOUS SPELLBOUND UNDER CAPRICORN ROPE and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked the audiences were turned off by Hitch's attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film) and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of it's star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasn't). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in it's favor. With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films. Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith the story was of how Guy Haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and fawning and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met...if a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and is in love with Anne Morton daughter of a Senator. Bruno knows that Miriam won't divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him. Then Bruno mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the eccentric Bruno is a sociopath and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each other's foe! It's a wonderfully simple plot actually. Bruno of course does kill Miriam but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified - and worse he finds that he is the police department's number one suspect. When Bruno to encourage Guy mentions he has the latter's lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site Guy finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno? Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other. There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's orbits. It is like fate drawing them together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch with a typical twist makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure. His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life. One suspects that once Guy too had one but his marriage's failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he was. The cast is good too. Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death). It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK. His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman) who bears a close resemblance to Miriam and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed. Other supporting performers Leo G. Caroll as the Senator Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's dotty mother and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master. ,positive
 I thought this movie was great if you didn't take it too seriously. Just sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all her greatness and laugh when the monks go to Boston MA. I also think this movie has a great message about self control and inner strength. Plus Mr. Myagi was so sweet I wish he'd teach me karate! ,positive
 This is a prime example of uninhibited filmmaking at its best. Richard Greene (who does good in the role) search for his two missing friends takes him to the Black Forest domain and castle of one-eyed Count Bruno (Stephen McNally) a past enemy of his whom he has never seen face to face. Incredible film has so many awesome elements combined (for once) into a single film--a crocodile pit; a hulking mute (played by Lon Chaney Jr.); a crafty doctor (played by Boris Karloff); a leopard hunt (VERY well done and VERY atmospheric); a love story; a castle; a swordfight; a sadistic one-eyed count and his two evil accomplices (played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate!!!); an intriguing background story which makes the film even more interesting; and more!. Jerry Sackheim's script doesn't allow itself to be bound in--making a film that comes extremely recommendable to anyone who is into unlimited filmmaking with a touch of horror and atmosphere to it. ,positive
 I adore this film. The chemistry between the two leads Miller and Carlisle is amazing they spark so well off of each other creating an unlikely comedy Duo. Alan Cumming is hilarious his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he camps it up. The acting is superb and it is a genuinely amusing and touching film. Not the greatest film ever made I'll admit but it is a huge amount of fun and I would recommend to those who enjoy other gritty Brit flicks. Includes some of the best British actors including Michael Gambon so you can't go far wrong. Look out for cameos from David Walliams and Matt Lucas of Little Britain and Rock: Profile fame. ,positive
 This is probably one of the best French movies I had seen in a very long time! This pastiche or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end. Some references to today's world are very subtle. The whole Maroccan context of the movie is to be understood in light of today's French culture/environment. That said all the jokes and - seemingly - shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context are permitted and accepted because this is a parody. I was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that I should go too and assured me that I was going to have a great time and indeed I had! If you liked the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots you will be delighted. I just hope this movie is released on DVD in the US... Wait and see. ,positive
 While some of the things in Haggard are dumb and unnecessary the overall package is good. Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) trying to win back Glauren (Jenn Rivell) Ryan's ex. The story is followed and developed surprisingly well it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story. And for all the Bam fan boys (And girls) there are multiple sequences of Bam skateboarding perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances even Don Vito got a bigger (but pointless) roll. If you are hoping to see a comedy and escape Bam's craziness then stay away from this movie otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it if you can find it. There are some truly funny scenes in this film. ,positive
 'The English Patient' is a love story set in Europe as World War II ends... It is a wartime romance mystery epic like 'Hiroshima Mon Amour ' 'The Sweet Hereafter ' and 'After Life.' Anthony Minghella weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience... This adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of 'Casablanca' and 'Dr. Zhivago.' The film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed... Told in flashback it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse... Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient Count Laszlo de Almasy a Hungarian cartographer of few words who works for the British government and is stationed in the North African desert... Count Laszlo is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the Allies taken into custody by a medical convoy in Italy and essentially left to die in peace in an isolated monastery in Tuscany under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine and reads to him a book considered his great treasure and his one surviving possession... Hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories wrapped up in his head released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind... Fiennes gives a haunted pained performance playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his heart's capacity for passion... He makes us sympathize with the character in showing self-doubt and weakness... As a badly burned man he has only cherished memories... His joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes... He remembers falling under the spell of an attractive English married woman... He remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love... His tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture... Kristin Scott Thomas matches Fiennes' work with a radiant sensuality... She is captivating as the married European woman conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the Count finds irresistible... Their different world despairing and hopeful menacing and resilient is simply beautiful... With intense passion and intelligence this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife... Juliette Binoche seems to shine as the French-Canadian nurse full of life and energy... This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold kissing wounded soldiers but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her... Colin Firth is good as Katherine's husband... He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent... He quickly becomes friend of the Count yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery his face reflected a peaceful fury... William Dafoe plays a double-agent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm... He is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda... This cunning Canadian man seems to know of some dark secret in Almasy's past... He believes the 'English patient' is partially responsible for the mutilation of his hands and is busy seeking revenge on everyone even remotely involved... Naveen Andrews is Hana's ardent lover He is a handsome Sikh and an explosives expert with a dangerous job There's a scene that is stuck in my head because it literally had me on the edge of my seat for what seemed an eternity In this particular scene the military sapper has to cut the wires on a bomb that has been hidden on a bridge It's on a timer and he only has a few minutes left The scene cuts back and forth between his tense face the wires and his dirty fingers as they try madly to figure out how to untangle and cut the wires without detonating the bomb All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in The English Patient. John Seale's cinematography is breathtaking and Gabriel Yared's majestic music is dreamy and romantic This is a rich motion picture with ambition and style a fever dream lyrical and complex We are almost able to feel the heat of the desert the pain of the burnings the intimate flush of humanity that becomes the most haunting element of this epic love story... ,positive
 Ideas are dangerous. Comment by one interviewee. DVD Rating: B+ / 4 out of 5 / 8 out of 10 / Worth the time. A great story for adults / or teen boaters but not for children. None of the stupid violent crime stuff so often mistaken by Hollywood these days as quality work. And it can be used as a trainer film on what proper boating preparation is all about or not about prior to sailing the seven seas. The movie starts out somewhat slowly to develop the story as most documentaries do but as it draws the viewer into the saga emotions begin to percolate in one's head! Emotions include anger sadness and disbelief. The era: late 1960's. That solo sailing around the globe is dangerous is not surprising. What is surprising is all the twists that viewers wouldn't expect. Its not your average group of guys in a sailing race! Each boat was different as allowed by the race rules. Each solo sailor had different levels of ability as allowed by the race rules. There were well known sailors among them and a few not so well known. One was considered a mystery man as nobody seemed to have any knowledge of his ability at all. Each boat was allowed to depart at will so long as all were underway by a certain date. And this was of course prior to modern electronics that allow boaters to communicate with shore about vicious storms etc. Actual video and audio recordings are interspersed with interviews of family members and others involved. The mood of the interviewees is always somber despite the years that have passed. The main character Don is the focus of attention & how his journey relates to those who he not only wanted to beat but due to circumstances of his own creation HAD to beat. He HAD to win. The story was about what that circumstance did to his life as he moved South West across the Atlantic Ocean over a years time alone on the water. Do NOT fail to view the special features section of the DVD once the film is finished. The entire saga isn't fully understood w/o viewing the 'bonus' stuff. In the end once you've watched everything on the DVD you will likely just shake your head and exclaim 'wow.' And keep in mind THAT is why the story has remained alive for the last 40 years. SPOILER: Do NOT fail to view the special features section of the DVD once the film is finished. One sailor who was headed back to England after circumnavigating the globe decided on the fly that no he was going for another spin and the film records his spouse's opinions about that decision. The opposite story unfolds as another sailor wishes the race allowed two on board so he could take his wife along and their photos demonstrate a very warm union between them. The interview with an burley ex paratrooper who had actually ROWED a boat across the Atlantic with a friend prior to the solo sail race was incredibly funny as he described not even knowing how to sail and who thought the bad things happening to him were 'normal.' Too many people think that setting sail in the open sea can be an romantic adventure without mishap. Don't you be one! ,positive
 This is an early one from the boys but some people may not be satisfied with this one like all the others. I found it to be different somehow than the your average Stooge slapstick. It was more funny for it's jokes rather than the poke in the eye or slap. Watch for a hilarious part when Larry grabs the stethoscope from Moe and sings into it. Moe gives him a good smack. That part made me crack up for a good ten minutes. Another hit for the Stooges. ,positive
 I like the shepherd! Sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. Van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. The story was average. A Texas cop battles smugglers. This movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. Van damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you. Scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movies in this movie are great. Van damme delivers strong kicks and it's good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies. This movie is definitely worth watching if you're a van damme fan. ,positive
 The bottom line is: if you come looking for a sci-fi thriller/horror film The Matrix is what you'll like. If like me you long for the rare true science fiction film involving characters with depth and provocative thought about where science will take us then you need to see eXistenZ. ,positive
 OK..you people need to settle down! This movie is not that bad. I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! I do have to admit that I have never been a fan of LeeLee Sobieski but she grew on me in this movie. I do think Josh Hartnett is good looking but c'mon..Chris Klein is the most gorgeous man I think I have ever seen!!! He made that movie better for me. C'mon girls..when he has no shirt on and goes to get water I know your mouth dropped. Yes I know in the beginning he is a jerk but in the end he realizes how he acted and learns to be a great guy. If he wouldn't have come at the end..then I would have been mad. I do think a couple of lines did not need to be said but all in all it was a great movie! I definitely recommend it! ,positive
 There have been many people that have tried to make a movie that was identical to the story Heart of Darkness. Some movies have been based on Heart of Darkness like Apocalypse Now. In 1993 Nicholas Roeg directed a film that was exactly like the book. Heart of Darkness the movie is almost exactly identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. Heart of Darkness is about the journey of a seaman named Marlow who sails along the Congo River to meet the super powerful ivory trader Mr. Kurz. Heart of Darkness the movie has the same exact beginning and setting as the book. It takes place on a boat in the Thames River and Marlow is telling the story to four other men on a boat called the Nellie. The whole movie is a flashback of Marlow's journey to see Mr. Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlow works for the Belgian Company which trades ivory along the Congo River. He tells of his account in the Company's office and about all of the maps he saw in the office. Marlow sets out on a steamer to Africa. He arrives at the Central Station where he receives orders from the general manager. The general manager tells Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and the ivory trading Marlow would be doing. Marlow soon finds out that the general manager is not fond of Kurtz because he fears Kurtz will replace him. Marlow waits around at the Central Station for months because his ship has been wrecked and it is getting repaired. Marlow sees the harsh treatment and enslavement in Africa while at the Central Station. When the ship has finally been repaired Marlow another African character named Mfumu and other crew members set sail on Marlow's steamer for Mr. Kurtz. Along the Congo River they are attacked by African natives in the wilderness. As Marlow's crew is attacked by the African natives they end up shooting and killing Mfumu. When Marlow finally arrives at Kurtz's station he meets a Russian who explains the might and glory of Kurtz. Marlow is then led to Kurtz's station home. There he sees many maps and pictures that Kurtz has painted. Finally Kurtz enters the room and begins to tell Marlow about all he has done in Africa and talks about his mistress. Marlow soon finds out that Kurtz is insane with power because the Africans hail him as a god. Marlow becomes angry with the harshness and enslavement that he sees in Africa. After Marlow finally meets Kurtz Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on his deathbed he called Marlow into his room. Kurtz's life begins to flash before his eyes and his last words were The horror the horror. When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fiancé Marlow tells her that Kurtz's last words were her name to hide the darkness in Kurtz's life. Heart of Darkness was directed well and was formed into an adventurous movie. I recommend anyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and mystery. The movie is slow at times but in all it really interesting. Heart of Darkness will really broaden your mind and will teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes. ,positive
 This picture's following will only grow as time goes by. Better than any of the best picture nominees in 97 and it rewards repeated viewings. I've seen it three times now so I know. Anderson was compared to some of the great American directors (Altman Scorcese Tarantino) and he may have those influences but chances are after a few more films he'll be considered part of that short list himself. One last note: Julianne Moore's Amber Waves will resonate in the memory long after other 90's movie characters have faded. THE best performance of the year -in any of the four categories. ,positive
 In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime i stumbled upon this film on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I always felt he was good not great (from what I've seen) This was the best of his films I've seen thusfar. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the overall product. My favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain (how exactly does he get his arm down there though?) Bruno is quite a compelling character but i also loved the performance by Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family as well as Guy were a bit dry and boring but she added some flare to the movie as well as having some of the better lines in the script. Lastly in any suspense movie you're going to live and die by your ending. This one holds water unlike a couple other Hitchcock films I've seen. I truly was unsure of how it would end which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited. ,positive
 Feels like an impressionistic film; if there is such a thing. The story is well told very poetic. the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters (or interpreted by the actors :)). The film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well unless you hate such emotion in movies - not so in my case. It's a very humanistic film. The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right. Well done. A good classic for any good film collection. ,positive
 This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals great songs a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune the cats will be out of the way. An excellent often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970's - a time when the Disney studio made few animations - which features songs such as the title number The Aristocats as well as Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat this will enchant viewers young and old with its enduring jazziness. ,positive
 I have watched this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with the previous comments. This is a tongue in cheek movie and some of the acting is meant to be stilted. Men like Paul Cowley are few and far between women like Linda unfortunately are a dime a dozen. The sad thing here is that although similiar relationships like this rarely lead to murder and frame ups it is an all to familiar scenario. Boy worships girl girl doesn't know he exists they grow up man sees woman he fantasized about down and out and rescues her. Bottom line she never did love him-he came along at the right time and she used him. Thomas is excellent as the nerdy but adequate Paul. His portrayal is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as the femme-fatale. What really moved me was the final scene. Paul says he eventually cried but not for Linda his wife but for the unknown girl he had watched from a distance so many years ago..and longed for..and loved. And I loved the close-up of Thomas at the end. ,positive
 my girlfriend as we walk in the cold London evening in leicester square after the movie says: if they didn't speak English and they didn't show the stadium you could have thought this was the slums of a South American city or some other slum anywhere in the world not Queens in NYC. Ramin Bahrani is right now my official hero because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the OTHER face of American but the REAL face of America. Ramin Bahrani's movies are like Ladri di biciclette or Germania anno zero or Roma citta' aperta. Chop shop is reality turned into a movie is more realistic than a documentary in fact I think Ramin Bahrani's movies are more realistic than documentaries. This is a great movies but don't expect any car chase or shooting. This movie is about tragic lives on the margin of the wealthiest richest country in the world. ,positive
 Ah classic comedy. At the point in the movie where brains get messed together a two minute scene with Bruce Campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole movie. For years and years Bruce Campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him. We want to see weird movies like Bubba Ho Tep. We want to see cameo roles in Sam Raimi movies and we want to see 'Man with the Screaming Brain'. With the title alone one knows that it's going to border that completely silly type of movie like Army of Darkness only with more silly and less monsters. The idea of the movie is simple. Bruce sees doctor. Doctor has new idea. Bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor. Coincidentally it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him. Hilarity ensues. With the addition of Ted Raimi as a weird Russian guy and journeyman Stacy Keach as Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov it's funny that does this movie. Complete funny. Never a point of scary. If you like the silly Bruce Campbell you'll like this. Then again why would you be watching this if you didn't like Bruce Campbell? ,positive
 There was a time when not all animation was Disney or Pixar. Its so nice to see this wonderful film again and I actually got hold of a good reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around.I got a very good copy by a company called Flashbacks and its quite good. In the old days I watched it on black and white on TV and its magic to see it in colour. Very much better than some would have you believe. The songs are delightful and the colour is great. Interestingly the characters are really well developed which is odd in animated movies. I loved Hoppity and the villain Mr Beatle is a real cad. Its incredibly imaginative. The way inanimate objects like cotton reels old tins become part of the environment and have new functions is great. The anthropomorhic use of insects is amazing considering the much malinged creatures most people sadly think are repugnant. Hopefully we may never step on an insect again! THe insects enemy is man. In reality of course its the insects that will survive. No matter how hard we try to rid ourselves of ants here in Australia they keep coming back. The battle has been lost and we have to live with them. There are several scenes that stand out such as when Hoppity and Mr Bumble are caught in a watering can the great flood and the journey to the top of the building are all wonderful. Its also rather anthropomorphic but in a way thats charming. The human characters look very like the ones in Gulliver and its incredibly effective. The wedding scene looks beautiful. Its a crime this movie has not been hailed as a classic. The only jarring note for me is the occasions in the film when the characters slip into verse. Speaking verse spoils the narration and it was no needed The verse is awful and spoils an other wise good script. Its great and kids will love it. Its a joy to look at. There's a very clever ending too. ,positive
 B.B. Thornton proves to be a great actor in this little seen movie. Thornton really gets into his characters--literally. I caught this on cable one night and enjoyed it. Too bad it was released nationwide in theaters the same year as Fear and Loathing and Half-Baked.  ,positive
 This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is truly original. Equal parts porn fairy-tale and musical-comedy - this film is definitely a strange bit of adult-film history. Alice is a sexually naive librarian who ends up following the rabbit into Wonderland where she meets all kinds of experienced weirdos like the Mad-Hatter (who likes to pull his dong out whenever possible) Humpty Dumpty (who broke his wiener along with his shell) Tweedledee and Tweedledum (a brother/sisters sex-crazed duo) and the bi-sexual Queen - among others. This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is actually quite tame by the standards of the time - a time when a lot of porn was mean-spirited and nasty (as noted by the roughie sub-genre) - this one is actually quite funny and strangely endearing. It's the kind of thing you'd show your kids - if it weren't for the graphic sex. A little slow getting to the good-stuff ...but genuinely entertaining. Oh - and some of the musical numbers are downright hilarious. If you're a drinker - have a few if you're a smoker - roll a couple and give this one a shot. 8/10 ,positive
 When I read the synopsis for Messiah in the television guide I was not prepared for what was in store. The story follows DCI Metcalfe trying to solve a case of grisly murders being taken out across London. He soon realises a pattern there is a serial killer on the loose killing people with similar names and jobs to those of the 12 Apostles and their killings are identical to their matching Apostle. The two part series kept me right on the edge of my seat with Metcalfe closely pursuing the killer but always missing him within a couple of seconds and discovering the gruesome mess he has left behind of his ill-fated victim. Messiah is sure to cause a great deal of controversy but nonetheless it is the greatest piece of drama the BBC has shown in a long time. ,positive
 I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well my meeting was pushed back because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well there was a lot of realism in it. The acting was good for a 1954 film. Subtle and genuine actions on the part of the characters that had me watching what they were going to do next. That is why I ended up watching it. I don't know why they don't show it more often. I would rather watch this than some films they play more than necessary. For history buffs people who like period films and those that are in the film appreciation groups will like this one. The Egyptian has a variety of flavors dealing with a lot of things to look at in human nature that has not changed since it's time. What does that say about us? Those that don't like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good story....are not into film. I haven't had the time to rent it if it is available but if I get a chance to see it again I would probably vote it a 10. ,positive
 This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's earlier films and it sure does have an unconventional theme. She's making money by dancing with men at a dance hall. She really doesn't like the work but it's a living. Her boyfriend seems like a pretty nice guy but she's also pursued by rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well after marrying it turns out her nice guy is a thieving womanizing weasel and rich Cortez turns out to be a heck of a guy. By the end of the film Barbara simply has had enough as any SANE woman would walk from this horrid marriage. In the 1920s and early 30s Hollywood did pretty much anything it wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today--such as nudity adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTS A DANCE isn't a blatant example of this morality it does have a theme that never would have been allowed after the toughened Production Code was created and enforced starting in 1934. In some ways the Code was great--after all parents didn't need to worry about what their kids saw in films (such as nudity in BEN HUR 1925). However it also tended to sanitize some of the movies far too much--and there is no way this particular film could have been made and approved because it tends to glorify divorce--a serious no-no 1934 and thereafter. This is really a shame as I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at all to discuss this--especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a philandering thief. Even so allowing the film to end with her divorcing him and marrying a man who himself was twice divorced just couldn't have been. Overall the film is interesting and thought-provoking. Plus it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time. Give this one a look. FYI--Sadly Ricardo Cortez was actually NOT Hispanic but changed his name because of possible prejudice because he was Jewish. He was an excellent leading man of his time but today is all but forgotten. ,positive
 I agree with Vince this movie paved the way for Goodfellas. The scene where Pesci was throwing peanuts at the piano player reminded me of his How am I funny? routine in Goodfellas. This is a highly underrated film and deserves some attention. As with many other mob films the theme of The Death Collector rings true: Always respect the Don. ,positive
 I know I'm human. And if you were all these things then you'd just attack me right now so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over then it has no more enemies nobody left to kill it. And then it's won. John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made  fast clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982 the movie focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy Norwegians appears at their base camp chasing an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed and the dog finds its way into the colony which is when things really start to get crazy. It is soon made quite clear that the dog is actually a shape-shifting alien organism which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims  in other words it begins to eat the Americans and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemies The pack of scientists led by MacReady (Kurt Russell) begin to fight for their own survival using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed amongst them then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at all?) The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians who unknowingly released it from its natural prison. The Thing the movie itself is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic Alien (1979). Many comparisons have been made  the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one-by-one. However The Thing  for all practical purposes  came first. Based on the famous short story Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr. (writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart) the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was The Thing From Another World an unarguable classic. But to be fair it bore little resemblance to the short story and Carpenter's remake does it more justice. The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great and is the most vital link to the short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape-shifting organism but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX. Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing although never actually taking one specific form is constantly seen in a morphing stage and the effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years later. Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and tinny but nevertheless haunting when used correctly. From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all time The Thing  by any standards  is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that at the time of its release The Thing performed poorly in theaters and E.T.  released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien  became the higher-grossing picture of the two (by far). In the long run however The Thing is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th Anniversary Re-Release. The Thing on the other hand has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics  it is one of the most famous non-famous movies ever made. Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career  from his amazing Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) to the magnificent Halloween (1978) to the disappointing and silly Escape from L.A. (1996) The Thing remains his very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most great movies lists The Thing is still one of my favorite horror films and  upon close inspection  masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling  a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one at the very least is genuinely unpredictable. ,positive
 I recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase I'm going through. I was born in 1980 and so film from mid-80s to mid-90s has quite an important place in my growing up. This particular movie was one of my favourites and so I was thrilled when it became available in the UK. It hasn't become worse with time it is still a great fun film with plenty of excitement in its own way. Sure it pales in the shadow of bigger larger budget films but don't let that stop you enjoying this. Worth a rent or even a purchase at the discount prices you'll find it for. ,positive
 I couldn't help but relish the entire premise of CAT IN THE BRAIN because it dutifully explains a director's steadily going mad seeing people murdered from past movies he has made. Even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past. Director Fulci playing himself is directing GHOSTS OF SODOM(?)and can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder. He seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses Fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps he's responsible. This is obviously a film playfully poking fun at Fulci's image while exploring the themes of how such a profession which produces so much death and destruction rarely untamed could mold and shape a legacy. The film features pretty much a wrap-around story surrounding non-stop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail. This has a shower murder Hitchcock never could direct or probably want to. The film's savagery compliments the mental state of Fulci's Fulci(..I know)during the running time. Reality and cinematic fiction have fused and Fulci can find no escape. The ending(..explaining the old cliché: It's only a movie )couldn't work any better than it does here. Fulci's boat says Perversion(..excellent touch)and he sails off..I can only wish this was his final film because that's a perfect close if there ever was one. David L Thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill his adulterous wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy is a cop Fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiend. The ultra-violence in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest a scythe a chainsaw and hatchet. The most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieces(..how a gardener's chainsaw work on a log fits beautifully in one nightmarish hallucination sequence)..the most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated! The opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away feasting on Fulci's brain is a howler. The scenes which are spliced within the film featuring a horrified Fulci looking on are obvious but I couldn't help but enjoy this anyway. ,positive
 For fans of Chris Farley this is probably his best film. David Spade plays the perfect cynical sarcastic yin to Farley's Baby Huey yang. Farley achieves strokes of comic genius in his monologues like the Let's say you're driving along the road with your family... bit the Jo-Jo the Idiot Circus Boy with a pretty new pet (his possible sale) speech or the Glue-sniffing Guarantee fairy brake pad sale. The sappy moments in the film contrast sharply with Farley and Spade's shenanigans. Even after many viewings it's still fun to see Farley pour everything he had into the role. Richard what's HAPPENING to me?!?!  ,positive
 Being American I have not been exposed to this character before which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies and although this is a slightly similar type of humor I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over. I'm actually going to buy this on DVD when I find it. ,positive
 'Radio' is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged James Robert Kennedy nicknamed 'Radio' and the football coach from the T.L. Hanna High School Harold Jones. Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent as Radio! I would never imagine to see him in a serious performance specially because most of the movies I watch with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones but this actor IS great so this is not anything new. The mentally challenged young man called James Robert Kennedy always walk around the T.L. Hanna High School without bothering anyone and almost not noticed. One day when the football's ball is throw near him he decides to stay with the ball for the impatience of Johnny Cash one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met. One day Cash decides to punish James mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up. When coach Jones discovers that horrible act he stays angry and punish all the team deciding for this day on to help James who gets the nickname 'Radio' because of his passion for radios in general. The movie shows how Radio becomes an adept assistant helping the team train despite hardships from the players and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city. I would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. It has a life lesson specially showing us how a person can make a difference even not being what we call ''normal''. Radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone and that's a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives. ,positive
 This film is a perfect example of great escapism! I loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning. Sure it's just an action flick but isn't having fun what watching movies is all about? The cast of this film are very strong with likable characters. The friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing it's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact - especially this group of boys!! Sean Astin makes a great rebel successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager. If you want fun watch this film! I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I was watching it on a very dirty and old VHS that was terrible quality (Go DVD's!) ,positive
 I think Josh Duhamel is so great!! The rest of the show is fun to watch but I think it is the handsome and sexy Josh Duhamel that makes the show Las Vegas really fun to see!! In the days of Magnum I loved Tom Selleck I thought he was the sexiest man on the face of the earth!! A hunk on a television show is a must in order for women to enjoy watching something especially just for purposes of innocuous entertainment!! I would have done anything to Win A Date With Tad Hamilton !! Josh Duhamel is incredible and I will always have a super crush on him!! Josh is definitely a HUNK!! and I will watch Las Vegas all the time Josh Duhamel is a big reason why too!! ,positive
 I went into this film thinking I wasn't going to like it but hoping to be surprised but this much like the film ended up being bleak and hopeless. But don't get me wrong Minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion. The acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for Law Kidman and Zellweger even though Portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film. The locations are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot. However for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to Minghella and his adaptation. The film is so utterly bleak it makes for what I consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film I didn't have the time to emotionally invest or hadn't recovered from a previous blow and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care not to mention predictable. Overall the Cold Mountain almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film as all I remember is death which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters. ,positive
 The entire civilized world by now knows that this is where Emil Sitka says his immortal Hold hands you lovebirds. But Shemp Howard Professor of Music steals the show. Watch him tutoring Dee Green as she fractures the Voices of Spring. Watch Shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string. Watch him as he gets walloped by Christine McIntyre. Watch him and you will laugh and learn. Moe is no slouch either. Watch him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap. Larry as usual is the Zen master of reaction. All in all one of the very best Stooge shorts. You won't find one weak moment. ,positive
 Fantastically written acted and produced! Loved seeing this gleaming talented cast -- every single one of them -- give a such great performance. This movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart! Great storytelling! This is a great movie for Black History month. Full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain -- with dignity and a belief in a better future. It is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adulthood. The next time you're in the company of a listening and observing child remember; show or he may be a writer-in-the-making! ,positive
 This is one of the great movies of all time. The story is fascinating and the actors are convincing. Your really identify with the characters. William Wyler proofs with this movie that he is a great director. His craftsmanship is unsurpassed. ,positive
 Well-known comedians meekly admit they wish they could do real satire like Bill Hicks. Inbetween these pitiful testimonies we are treated to what an exceptionally talented comedian can achieve when he could otherwise be chasing fame and fortune. He didn't get his own talk show but at least he was no one's puppet. ,positive
 Following the advice of a friend I got myself this movie. I'm very fond of computers in general - hence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the Internet could not be left unseen. I had some bad echoes about it but in the end I wasn't so disappointed : the story though classical is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. I was gladly surprised when I figured out that contrary to what we usually see computer-performed actions are somehow realistic as they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. The end is typically American. The actors' performance is globally OK Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with her oh my god why me way to behave but this time she seems to have controlled herself. I'd recommend that movie. ,positive
 Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. People have criticised the film on a lot of grounds but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack. I would begin by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits but I think that would be unfair. The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. The class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. The two things that are truly lacking here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield who are replaced with Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively. Now I am not about to try and argue that Ackroyd comes close to Murray in the movie but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. He comes off as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang but without biting too heavily on either. I wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film. Chevy Chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie which is another common complaint. Maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. For my money his scenes here are a lot funnier if somewhat over-directed. While I'm on the subject it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. It comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. Many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the Gopher who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny. Characters are similarly hammered home particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat and is consistently likable and very funny but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! The director is clearly not of the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle but the jokes here are just a little overcooked and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue. All things considered this is a fun goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying. Don't be put off by the appallingly low rating on IMDb check it out for yourself. ,positive
 I had always wanted to see this film and the first three-fourths proved I hadn't waited in vain. But what the hell happened in the end? I mean don't get me wrong I liked the film. It definitely made me nostalgic of the realistic unique NYC of the 80s that we have lost thanks to Giuliani. But it's missing another half hour! ,positive
 Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater. Once again someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing their thing to one of the great works in literary history. Who would've ever thought Homer had this in mind? I don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of Hollywood but it will be in both mine and many others DVD or VHS library. It is one of those films that you can watch over and over. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame great performances by Clooney Turturro Nelson and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter. Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south I wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this. They even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south. You are NOT doing anything better this weekend go see this movie! ,positive
 I thought this movie was amazing. I was a bit skeptical since I really had no idea what it was about but it was beautiful story. I cried a lot and I also laughed out loud. I think it is very important that there are movies being created that are about the Holocaust and how it affects people (It only happened 60 years ago!) I have been to Germany and Eastern Europe and I have studied the Holocaust so this film meant a lot to me. I think this film did an amazing job capturing this story (I wont go into detail I do not want to spoil it) But I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that I know this may sound cliché' but will change your mindset on things. ,positive
 My wife and I find this movie to be a wonderful pick-me-up when we need to have a good laugh - the conflict between some characters and the repore between others make this a sure fire comedy relief. I am so looking forward to this movie coming on DVD so I can replace my well watched VHS. ,positive

 Peter Lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the titled place. The plot has a new government agent being put on the track of Peter Lorre's character. When the G-man's contact his killed by one of Lorre's agents the G-man is sent to prison for the killing even though everyone knows there is more to the story. Lorre has the man paroled into his care and brought to his island where he is mining diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows but he isn't talking and a battle of wills is set in motion. This is a good solid little thriller that doesn't quite make a great deal of sense plot wise but even so the film holds your interest. I had put the film on last night in order to use it as something to drift off to instead I found the tale riveting enough I was up an extra 70 minutes. Lorre is the reason that one falls into this. His quite demeanor is unnerving. He does very little but its clear from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him (watch how they light his cigarettes) that he is a bad dude. Worth a look if you should run across it. ,positive
 I hope from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it nearly turned me mad into a joy to watch. The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up cutting its way through the centre of the village and more worringly through the middle of the churchyard. This causes some deceased buried in the Catholic churchyard to now be in the Protestant north - and so the local priest assisted by a wide variety of eccentric locals aims to move the bodies back undercover of darkness and so avoiding the bureaucratic British border guards. It was inspired work to cast the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes to play the part of Madigan. He brings an innocence to the part especially in his to-camera pieces (which is normally where he interacts with the voiceover of Richard Attenborough playing supposedly the writer/director of the film). Daragh O'Malley playing Father Rudden is also worthy of considerable praise; and the rest of the cast from the household names like Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones to people with what would normally be called 'bit parts' - such as Spike's daughter Jane who plays Madigan's wife give 100% The credit for this goes in no small part to the wonderful characterisations given by Spike in the original book. I could argue that the film is slightly too long or that Elliott Gould's Irish accent left a little to be desired but those would be only minor points and take nothing away from the excellence of this film. ,positive
 This episode so far is the best of the series. The story was told perfectly. I especially liked how the writers made it a Desmond episode; it was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved the Emmy for his performance. We had some of our questions answered in this episode but since the show is called Lost we know there will be more questions brought up too. First the answered: Walt is reunited finally with his father Michael second Michael's betrayal is exposed to Jack Sawyer Kate and Hurly and because of this betrayal Kate Jack and Sawyer are all taken captive by The Others. This was a great way to end the show. On the other side of the island we see Locke going through a mental breakdown with the button. This leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down. However there are some unanswered questions: first what happened to Locke Eko and Desmond when Desmond turned the failsafe key and what was the deal with the scientists in the Arctic searching for electromagnetic annamolies. Guess we'll find out next season however great ending to the best show on TV. ,positive
 It was an interesting and entertaining movie well worth watching. The acting was decent but it may be out of date for some people. I was glad to see cast members of such highly acclaimed movies as Raging Bull and Goodfellas in this movie A great and dramatic ending and pretty good writing. ,positive
 Anthony Minghella's 'The English Patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards the film owned the night taking home nine awards from twelve nominations the most decisive cleansweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name 'The English Patient' is a touching meditation on life love and loss tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of World War Two. During the war a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia he is assumed to be an Allied soldier and is simply referred to as the English patient. After the war in the mine-ridden hills of Italy a kind nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) who has apparently lost everybody close to her remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time she comes to learn more and more about her English patient who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. Via numerous flashbacks we learn of Almásy's former exploits in the Sahara desert and his romantic liaison with a married woman Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; not since David Lean's magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from Almásy's plane. Even in the film's more intimate moments excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene coupled of course with the brilliant performances from all the cast members. A long-time favourite actor of mine 'The English Patient' might just contain Ralph Fiennes' finest performance and considering his history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener ' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. His Count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very sympathetic character but as we slowly learn more about his past his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others. Ownership is a major theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most Almásy replies with Ownership. Being owned. When you leave you should forget me. However as the relationship progresses and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes: I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine which belong to me. Juliette Binoche who received an Oscar for her performance here is excellent as Hana the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. After some time of caring for Almásy alone she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who lost his thumbs during the war and who suspects that it was Almásy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) an Indian bomb-diffuser in the British Army. However due to her past history Hana is afraid that becoming involved with Kip will doom him to death particularly considering his very dangerous line of work. At 160 minutes in length 'The English Patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old successfully finding a balance of mystery love joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful but also uplifting in its own way. Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless in every case it is always better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. ,positive
 This is the most difficult movie I have ever seen...the emotional content is horrific yet unforgetable. A woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning. The whole movie revolves around her interrogation. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve Oscars for their performances. ,positive
 Amazing amazing amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is depicted and depicted well. Some people have complained about his age but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. If anything he looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more worthy Ophelia could have been found. Her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. The only real exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart who is a great Claudius. The rest of the cast is good but Jacobi is what truly elevates this teleplay. ,positive
 I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fakes his death fabulously! Over all I thought the movie was great definitely not a boring plot line! It's sad to say but I think lots of men might feel this way. I think he should have just gotten a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to but he felt there was no other way out so he faked his death. I thought it was neat that Cole's real-life wife played the wife he was unhappy with in the movie. I think what the guy did was alittle extreme but the movie was great nonetheless! Definitely recommend it! ,positive
 This is the true story of the great pianist and jazz singer/legend Ray Charles (Oscar BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jamie Foxx). He was born in a poor African American-town and he went blind at 7 years old but with his skills of touch and hearing this is what would later in life would lead him to stardom. By the 1960's he had accomplished his dream and selling records in millions and leading the charts with songs and albums. But the story also showed his downfalls including the separation from his wife and child because of his affair with a band member his drug and alcohol use and going to prison because of this. Also starring Regina King as Margie Hendricks Kerry Washington as Della Bea Robinson Clifton Powell as Jeff Brown Harry J. Lennix as Joe Adams Bokeem Woodbine as Fathead Newman Aunjanue Ellis as Mary Ann Fisher Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson C.J. Sanders as Young Ray Robinson Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun and Richard Schiff as Jerry Wexler. It is a great story with a great singer impression the songs including Hit the Road Jack are the highlights. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Mixing and it was nominated for Best Costume Design Best Director for Taylor Hackford Best Editing and Best Motion Picture of the Year it won the BAFTA for Best Sound and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Craig Armstrong and Best Original Screenplay and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. It was number 99 on 100 Years 100 Cheers. Very good! ,positive
 Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is. Everyone out there will like it! Sandwiched between the amount of breast shots the times Jacqueline rubs herself the various times Jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the Magdelena Mountains this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end. Unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples this one takes awhile to guzzle. The performing is good. Other than great acting by Dan the pizza delivery guy (must see) there are no standouts but no notably bad outcroppings from my recent dinner either (and I do mean recent). Excellent acting overall because there are no typically dreadful actors which you'd find in movies of the four Skin related data fields or in the biological skimmer's found in any IBM shop. In addition if you see a female in this movie the likelihood is that she will be butt naked by the next scene! Now that I think about it there is quite a bit of action in this movie. Between the first and the second electro yank obtained from a hot chick and the time you observe her buckets naked keeps em' speculating. I loved it! ,positive
 This might be my favorite so bad it's awesome film of all time. like many pre-teen children of the 80's repeat viewing of revenge of ninja spawned a ninja phase of my childhood. Man i thought Sho k. was badass back then. Jet Li could wup him with both legs in a cast! This movie has insane crossovers that include flashdance the exorcist and the Lee Van cleef ninja TV show. ugh. but as a friend of mine says anyone can get a good movie made it takes true genius to make a film that starts with a ninja surviving 17 shotgun blasts long enough to take over the body of arobics instructor to get revenge. wow. While previous commentors have metioned the sword flying out of the closet on the string no one has yet metioned the powerful love scene. Where the sexy leading man cop takes off his shirt to reveal a mane of backhair. The fun never ends. Rent this!!!!!! ,positive
 This is another of those rare movies one feels grateful to be introduced to instead of the usual Hollywood tripe. It really is a roller coaster ride as we follow the effects of a a forged 500 Euro note on a multitude of people. One asks 'what if' all the time but it certainly is a butterfly effect captured on film. It'll have you laughing crying and biting your lip. I loved every minute of it! And thank you SBS Australia for showing films that are truly entertaining even worth the effort to read the subtitles. The only downside to my mind is that I wont be booking a holiday to the Frozen Land - they all seem to be far too depressed - must be all that cold weather. Either way watch it - it's worth every second. ,positive

 The Gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber portrays Jane Hawkins a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist. The promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around Jane's accidental reunion with a former teammate. Although this meeting takes place that plot line is secondary to the main plot which involves Jane her husband and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women develop an act of the type performed by Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other--Jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength. Serena is more elegant and artistic although obviously also capable of incredible physical feats. The film works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie who is caring and compassionate while Jane's husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage. Both women are incredibly fit and athletic and Dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. They clearly are truly performing their act and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed be a success in Las Vegas or anywhere else they traveled. The sexual tension between the women is obvious and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air. A woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation which isn't resolved in a neat and tidy fashion. Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival we thought this one was the best. It will work on DVD and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen. NOTE: Stay for the credits! ,positive
 As I was reading through the comments I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was not very profound. I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die. It is about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself. It reminded me strongly of the book Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers which has a similar story of redemption. Yes the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking but if you look close enough you may just see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty but they are real. ,positive
 Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series published in 1981 it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then it has become available but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player which you have to hack--illegally I suspect to see it) but the series is now available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for between $19-21 to be viewed on DVD in the US format no hacking. There were 41 reviews average 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the very best on Oppenheimer or the Manhattan Project or virtually anything produced by the BBC. ,positive
 I first encountered Arthur Penn's Four Friends late one night on HBO. Having never heard of it I expected very little but watched because I was interested in seeing what a creation by a teaming of Penn and screenwriter Steve Tesich would be like. For the next two hours or so I sat mesmerized watching this incredible teaming of talent and the story they wove. A semi-autobiographical tale of a young immigrant to America growing up amidst the turbulence of the 1960s Four Friends follows the story of Danilo an eastern European immigrant (the brilliant Craig Wasson) from his arrival in the United States through a decade that changed the American landscape. Accompanying Danilo on his journey are his friends Georgia (the radiant Jodi Thelan in a role that sadly she has never had the opportunity to equal) Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston). Four Friends covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here but if you haven't seen this film I urge you to find a copy (it's just been released on DVD) and watch it. You won't be disappointed. Tesich's script is wonderfully poignant  at times funny at times incredibly sad but always fascinating and honest. Penn directs with a sure hand and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we're following. The cast is uniformly superb. This film should have made a major star out of Wasson who is truly one of this country's most wasted talents. Jodi Thelan not your standard brainless Hollywood sexpot heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the film. Metzler and Huddleston subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co-stars but they are excellent and help anchor the film. Also superb are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. I have not been without a copy of Four Friends since the day after I first saw it on HBO those many years ago. It has been and remains one of my all-time favorite films for more than 20 years now. I can't recommend it enough and feel if you give it a chance you'll feel the same way. ,positive
 Story about a widowed father (Claude Rains) bringing up his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is loved by big hunky Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is romanced by an old but wealthy man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is a romantic. Drop dead handsome Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn) a business associate of their father comes to stay with them. All the sisters fall in love with him. Then tough cynical Mickey (John Garfield) enters the picture... Very entertaining movie was a big hit and nominated for five Academy Awards. It's beautifully directed by Michael Curitz has a pretty good (if predictable) script and a VERY attractive cast (especially Lynn). Also this was John Garfield's first film and made him a star. This was so popular there were three or four sequels (which I never saw). This is an engrossing entertaining big budget soap opera--well worth seeing. ,positive
 Wow here is another great golf movie. That's at least three in the past few years that I've really enjoyed that were well-done beautifully-filmed and inspirational. The other two were Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius and The Legend Of Bagger Vance. This is a true underdog story if there ever was one. To have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the United States Open Golf Tournament is an unheard-of feat. I believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished. How much of this film is fiction embellished for dramatic effect I don't know. I do know that I plan on reading the book and I know that in real-life Francis Ouimet had a three-stroke lead in playoff with just two holes to go unlike what we saw in the film. Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is fact. It is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here. It isn't something just for golf fans; this is a fun movie. Kudso to actor-turned-director Bill Paxton for an outstanding job. Yes a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as Ouimet's relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him. It's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance. The movie also deals with Vardon's demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an elitist's sport which it was at the time for both Europeans and Americans. Shia LaBeouf is winsome as Ouimet as is Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day maybe even more unbeatable. In the film Vardon is pictured as a warm nice guy; a genuine human being. the other major competitor Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy. The fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film: a fifth-grade boy who winds up being Ouimet's caddie in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie. If all of this - a playoff with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole - were not true you would think Oh man this is so hokey. Who could believe this? That's what makes this true-life story fun to see finally captured on film. As with another sports film of 2005 - Cinderella Man - here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards. I guess nice films don't win awards.....just the hearts of their viewers. ,positive
 As you can see I loved the book so much I use the title for my internet alias and have for over 15 years. (Okay so it had to be spelled phonetically to fit the name character limit for the BBS at the time but what could I do?) If anyone every finds this movie I would absolutely love to see it! Janet McTeer is great in everything else I've seen of hers. I think she would have made a great Prue. And it even features early Clive Owen - from before Chancer (a great series itself). What's not to love? I hope the powers that be wise up and make this available on DVD soon! With some of the true dredge they pout out it's about time well executed productions make it on the market too. ,positive
 Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side? Kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of The Muppet Movie while singing his signature song The Rainbow Connection. As time goes by the question and the movie only gain profundity. I'm going to forgo the review of this movie as a children's comedy but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing year. As the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me I hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyone's life because we all dream. And that is what this movie is about. It's not just a bunch of puppets-- it's a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams which is a good lesson for everyone. And while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good they're not a fair judge of the movie. Only The Rainbow Connection and the powerful emotions it will realize. And it all fits in: Rainbow Connection *is* the Muppet Movie and vice versa. It's existentialism meets children's entertainment-- there's no simpler way to describe it. ,positive
 I caught this movie on TV yesterday. I had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by Emilio Estevez and starring him and his real-life Dad Martin Sheen. I love to see a movie about a father-son relationship that involves a real-life father and son. Naturally there's an instant chemistry between Sheen and Estevez and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that they're actually related. Of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors. I've seen Martin Sheen in intense roles before but I think this is Emilio's most intense role--being that I mostly recall him from the Mighty Ducks series--and I was very impressed. Talent REALLY does run in that family. And Kathy Bates steals the movie in an Oscar-worthy performance. She tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue. Kimberly Williams--the beautiful actress from the Father of the Bride movies--is also very good holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors. The movie is a bit stagey with dialogue that's obviously geared for the stage but that didn't bother me. This is not meant to be an action movie; this is a character study. And for a film that's based on a play it never gets too claustrophobic. When Emilio's character Jeremy reminisces to his days in Vietnam we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life. The film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental. At the end I expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunky-dory but that's not how it turned out. The ending made me cry without resorting to standard Hollywood melodrama. That proves reality is much more gripping than anything Hollywood can conjure up. If you're in the mood for a beautiful powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks off...please check out this underrated gem. Hopefully one day Martin and Emilio will unite with Charlie and they will all make a great film together. My score: 9 (out of 10) ,positive
 Before I saw this film I read the comment of someone who wasn't very fond of it. This I must admit made me apprehensive to dedicate 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to it but I'm glad I did. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor I especially loved the Believer. Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presented an interesting view on life and death. It was very touching and very sad yet it kept me interested which most touching stories cannot do. It is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it you should see it. It was unique and I don;t think that anyone will ever be able to duplicate it. All of the young actors did surprisingly well given the subject matter and the emotion that must have gone into it. I was pleasantly surprised. ,positive
 Horror-genius Dario Argento is one of my personal favorite directors and his films Suspiria Phenomena and Profondo Rosso range high on my personal all-time favorite list. Opera of 1987 is yet another tantalizing and brilliant film that no Horror lover can afford to miss and that will keep you on the edge of your chair from the beginning to the end. This stunning and ultra-violent Giallo could well be described as the master's nastiest film which is quite something considering that Argento's films are not exactly known for the tameness of their violence. The violence is extreme and very stylized in a brilliant way that makes Opera a film censor's nightmare. - Warning! SPOILERS ahead! - Just when Betty (Christina Marsillach) a young opera singer is becoming successful a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts stalking her... The murders are truly brutal and of particularly sadistic nature. The killer attaches needles to the tied up Betty's eyelids so she has to keep them open and watch while he brutally murders people close to her in abhorrent ways. When done with the butchering the killer releases Betty and leaves just to come back for other friends of hers... As usual for Argento's films the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized. Opera truly is a brutal film and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is. This film is absolutely tantalizing and pure suspense from the beginning to the end. The performances are entirely very good especially Christina Marsillach is brilliant in the lead. A stunning beauty and great actress alike Marsillach fits perfectly in her role of the talented singer whose fear and horrid experiences are slowly making her crazy. Other great performances include those of Ian Charleston as a Horror film director who is directing an Opera and director Argento's real-life girlfriend Daria Nicolodi who has a role in many of his movies. The camera work is excellent as in all Argento films and The huge Opera House is an excellent setting that contributes a lot both to the film's beauty and its permanently creepy atmosphere. The score which is partly classical music and partly heavy metal is great too even though I slightly missed Goblin's brilliant Progressive Rock Soundtracks that are such a distinguishing element of most other Argento movies. Opera truly is a terrifying and absolutely breathtaking Giallo experience. This is an absolute must-see for any Horror lover and I highly recommend it to any other film-fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tantalizing! ,positive
 I saw this movie about 12 years ago and I can still remember it as if I just saw it recently. That is how much this movie has affected me. Considering this is a movie from the 50's I think it was ahead of its time. It surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject some might have considered taboo back then. Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartwretching journey that an addict chooses to embark on. One can only imagine how the audiences were affected by the realism of this movie back in those days. I personally think is was one of Frank Sinatra's top five performances in the big screen. When others are discussing movies dealing with Mental Illness and/or addiction I always recommend The Man with the Golden Arm as one of the top five to watch. ,positive
 I really enjoyed this movie... In My DVD collection of baseball movies... Reminded me how great the sport truly is... Whether it's here in America or Japan. ,positive
 Shadows is often acclaimed as the film that was the breakthrough for American independent cinema. Whether thats true or not it is an undeniably important film one whose influence can be traced all the way to today's Sundance fodder. Here is a film which tackles controversial topics of the day (namely racism) and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative fashion. Also it deals with sex in a frank manner that Hollywood wouldn't even discuss until The Graduate . Still the question remains is it as powerful today as when it was originally released? The answer is yes. While many important films are hard to watch and dated nowadays Shadows retains every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now. It deals with racism as a personal issue and not a political one so its still relevant. Plus it works as a great time capsule capturing the 1950s beat generation and New York art scene in a way possibly no other film has. On a technical level its admittedly uneven. Cassavetes had yet to gain full confidence as a director and the choppy editing reflects the film's low budget. Still the film's story is remains powerful. Plus the acting considering the inexperience of the cast and improvisational nature is phenomenal. All around the actors create realistic characters ones who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions. Shadows is absolutely mandatory viewing for film buffs. (9/10) ,positive
 While the movie has its flaws it brings to light some of the problems that come with living in a country that has no democracy. It makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives their struggles and a potential leader Aung San Suu Kyi. It makes one wonder why our government will interfere places we are not wanted yet ignore those who ask our help. ,positive
 It's 1913. A studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become Hollywood's next great movie star and he's the director that's going to make it happen. After inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops his dream comes true. Being completely absorbed in his film-making however he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man. Several over-budget flops later he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego. He'll be okay as long as he still has his friends. This movie starts out as a mad-cap comedy typical of the time period and in the opening scenes it holds its own with the best of them. It has a playful lack of self-consciousness which is sorely missing in most of today's comedies. Shortly into the film however it moves away from this mode of comedy and instead attempts to entertain us using the films within the film. These are silent slapstick comedies well done but nothing out of the ordinary and they go on for much longer than is necessary for any audience which has seen the originals. Upon returning the film takes a dramatic turn. It's well written and the cast does an excellent job of making the transition but the movie really should have decided from the beginning what it was going to be. By the end of the film it has transformed once again - this time into a paean to the glitter of Hollywood. The small town of Los Angeles has grown up into the city which makes the movies that entertain the whole world. In spite of its promising beginnings this film has not aged particularly well. Nevertheless it does have some strong scenes a certain nostalgic appeal and an entertaining sub-text about the people who made it and the audiences it was made for. ,positive
 A fun romp...a lot of good twists and turns! (and we were not even baked!) Didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD...(oddly it was there along with The City of Lost Children and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen) The plot keeps you wondering throughout. The acting was awesome...Hank Azaria shows his talent again Bill Bob is Billy Bob...(wecis?) Definitely worth watching. ,positive
 Bergman´s tale about how the hell of the war can drive a sensible couple of musicians to the barbarousness. With many memorable scenes throughout the film I found particularly remarkable that close to the end where Ullmann and Von Sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea. A fascinating masterpiece! ,positive
 Fado is a sad almost bluesy style of Portuguese Gypsy music that is heard repeatedly trough the movie. As explained by one of the main characters (Igor) it also means fate. Indeed it's fate that bring the two main characters Paco and Alex together and triggers the problems that ensue. On the whole I enjoyed it quite a bit. It starts out as an 'on the down and outs' drama/road movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller / road movie. There were two things that I found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating (I gave it an 8). The first is the major point of why did Alex give the stuff away. She was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger? Her explanation was unconvincing. Also how did they get through the gate where were the cops? ,positive
 This video is a fantastic testament and insight into the work of Bill Hicks. Thought provoking barely begins to describe it.It's funny and moving and educational and a whole host of other things that are good for you. Make sure you see it. ,positive
 I wouldn't be so sure to accept the DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against Anna Anderson. First read Peter Kurth's book on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew things that only the real Grand Duchess Anastasia could possibly have known (forensic evidence in Anna's favor aside). Second compare the pictures of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Anyone can see that they are one-and-the-same person. Third visit Peter Kurth's website (url below) where you can read detailed information about the DNA tests as well as why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (scroll down to the link ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA ). Even Schanzkowska's relatives believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person. I for one will always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were indeed the same person; I will never be swayed to the contrary . www.peterkurth.com ,positive
 I mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what I discuss although I don't really think I am giving away anything important. Any suprises are really unimportant to this film's success or a viewer's ability to enjoy it. While not without some very minor flaws this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship time uncertainty and the choices people make about their lives. Yet at the same time it is also a very humorous film with small mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout. For much of the film it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and into the lives of the characters and at first it is mostly rather light-hearted. Some have commented that much of the film seems slow but it is such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that one could watch it almost endlessly. As it progresses the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully. Eventually some of the characters decide to rob a bank and although it is perhaps somewhat hard to believe that is beside the point. It is a wonderful addition to emphasise the love that these friends have for each other while at the same time it accents the humour and adds a little more irony to the film. And although hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully making it really quite funny as well such as when Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to disguise the fact he's old. As I said most of the other comedy is rather low-key but still very humorous so I was constantly chuckling throughout. The actors are probably the real key to this film. They imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters' personalities which are pulled off smoothly and beautifully. Of course the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care for and interact with one another. It succeeds so well because of them and if lesser actors had the roles the movie could well have failed. Gule Gule is not without sadness but that simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience. In fact the film is so moving and filled with so much love from such rich characters that it is in the end a very heart-warming satisfying and even happy film despite its sadness. I could watch it over and over. ,positive
 This film tops the previous incarnation by a mile taking everything to the next level. As always the JackAss guys are purely unbelievable and I personally laughed harder in that theatre than I have in a long time. Like the first JackAss this isn't so much a movie as an eighty minute long string of stunts and pranks. It is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level. Essentially these guys are clowns debasing themselves for the amusement of others. And its great. The shenanigans are so low outrageous and often disgusting that they transcend into a higher form of entertainment. You can't rate this along other movies its in a class of its own. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for the pure spectacle that it is. ,positive
 Jim Henson as Kermit Dr.Teeth Rowlf and Waldorf. Frank Oz as Fozzie Piggy and Animal. Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper Robin the Frog Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry. Richard Hunt as Janice Statler Beaker and Scooter. Dave Goelz as Gonzo Dr.Hunnydew and Zoot. Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. cameos by Steve Martin Carol Kane Orson Welles Bob Hope Richard Pryor and others. This is the first Muppet movie of the billion others that came out and is also the best by far! This deals with Kermit the frog going on a trip to Hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way. This movie along with being already good has excellent songs performed by the Muppets including Rainbow Connection Can You Picture That? Moving Right Along and others. This movie unlike the other Muppet flicks carries a strong sentimental value to me. It's such a nice movie. Also noted is it's many cameos featuring Steve Martin Mel Brooks and a dozen others. my rating-A plus. 109 mins. rated G. ,positive
 This movie is a masterpiece of brilliant acting and timely patriotic sense of pride in America. The Nazi Saboteurs of the 40's are replaced by the Middle East Terrorists of today. The intent is the same to terrorize disrupt lives destroy property and kill Americans! We see a wrongly accused Barry (Bob Cummings) on the lamm trying to uncover the real Nazi terrorists plot meeting the beautiful Pat (Priscilla Lane) and together they travel to New York chasing the devious and evil saboteur Fry played expertly by Norman Lloyd. Along the way they encounter the also very sinister Otto Kruger playing the leader of the Nazi saboteur ring but disguised as a distinguished model citizen where Barry seeking saboteur Fry takes him into his confidence only to handed over to the local law enforcement. He escapes meets a kindly blind gentleman and his niece enter Priscilla Lane. From there Barry and Pat travel to Soda City Cal. run into the West coast saboteur gang heading East. They trail ends up in the mansion of a unlikely New York Socialite. The going gets tough when the bad guys kidnap Pat from Barry and he goes after her with reckless abandon. The movie climax is the famous Statue of Liberty scene which is excerpted in many compilations. This is a true blue patriotic flag-waving performance at it's best and what is wrong with that! See this movie if you don't see another Hitchcock film. You will be swept up in the patriotic furore and the love interest between Cummings and Lane will make you wish they had been paired in other movies. She is the beautiful ideal girl next door often underrated her talent shows through in this film. See it and Go Bless America! ,positive
 Overall I enjoyed the movie Scarlett. I am a huge fan of Gone with the Wind. I have read the book and seen the classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my all-time favourite book and movie. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are remarkable actors and two of my favourites. Unfortunately I was unable to read the book Scarlett but I was excited to see the movie. Truth be told the movie is not any where close to the calibre of Gone with the Wind and neither are the actors. However Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were pleasant actors in the roles and at many times Joan sounded like Vivian Leigh in her portrayal of Scarlett. Dalton also portrayed Rhett well at times. It took some time getting used to the different actors but overall I really enjoyed it being the fan of Gone with the Wind as I am. One major disappointment was that Joan did not have green eyes and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh both did. I also found the Lord Fenton absolutely appalling and I did not like his character. If you are a Gone with the Wind fan and/or enjoy romantic stories see the movie Scarlett. However do not expect it to be remarkable like Gone with the Wind. It is far from it although it is interesting with the new characters and so on. I am happy it is not a remake and some of the events in the story was what I imagined the continuation to be of the Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler love story. If you haven't seen it today get it tomorrowafter all tomorrow is another day. :) ,positive
 In the late sixties director Sergio Corbucci made four spaghetti westerns in a row--the classics THE MERCENARY THE GREAT SILENCE THE SPECIALISTS and COMPANEROS. Three of these all except THE SPECIALISTS are constantly turning up on ten best lists when spaghetti westerns are rated. Until recently all I had seen was a very poor quality compilation with some English some Italian a fuzzy picture and it was nearly incomprehensible. Now having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (still in two languages however) I can safely include THE SPECIALISTS in that group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is very good as the charismatic Hud a notorious hand with the gun returning to Blackstone to investigate the death of his brother who was lynched by the townspeople for losing their savings. It involves a voluptuous beauty who owns the bank a Mexican bandit leader El Diablo who was once friends with Hud an honest sheriff who dreams of better days and a small band of hippies--well it was the late sixties and hippies were everywhere even apparently in our westerns. It's not a desert western shot in the alps somewhere and is lovely to look at. There is a bit more nudity than I expect in a western but that's not a bad thing. Sylvie Fennec is lovely as Sheba who may be Hud's niece or dead brother's girlfriend...that's never made clear. This film deserves to be seen and once again we plea for a nice DVD with all the trimmings--I think THE SPECIALISTS would be as well known as any of Corbucci's other westerns and that's high praise indeed. ,positive
 If you like silly comedies like Airplane you'll love this movie! It's definitely in the style of Airplane and Scary Movie. A fun film! It has the strangest cast of characters all in the same movie. Michael Jackson Evan Marriott Joyce Giraurd Stuart Pankin Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are hokey but I think they're supposed to be since it's a silly comedy. There is apparently two versions of the film one at Blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com. The one on the website appears to be a preview release version signed by the director. There's some fun behind the scenes material filmed at Neverland with Michael Jackson as well. The movie was filmed in 2003 and says it's PG rated fun on the box. ,positive
 I really liked this movie. I watched it last night on the Public Broadcasting System. The part I liked about it was the fact that they dealt with issues of today not in the future or the past. They basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs. I think what the movie could have showed was people in different countries at the same time. It did show the fact that England or any other country isn't prepared for an attack on the magnitude that they showed. I have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so I can't really say if they are normally their parts. After the movie they had this panel of experts talking about if something like that could happen here in the U.S. It was a thought-provoking discussion! ,positive
 GLORIFYING not GLAMORIZING World War II. We've had quite a few documentary series about World War II on the regular Television programming. Without looking up any information in some encyclopedia or film book it seems that this old memory can recollect most names entirely on it's own. There was CRUSADE IN EUROPE which was the title of the war memoirs of one General of the Army and later the 33rd President of the United States of America Dwight D. Eisenhower. It told the story of the conflict in Europe as viewed by the Supreme Allied Commander. Then there was a CRUSADE IN THE PACIFIC(subject matter self-explanatory) which I don't remember much about. Newspaper Man/Author Jim Bishop was the host/navigator of BATTLELINE. And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL THE VALIANT YEARS.* The Series was a co-production of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Company. It first aired in 1960-61 season here in The States and boasts of having Richard Burton's speaking the words of Sir Winston. It is the 1952 NBC Television Network's Production of our subject matter today this VICTORY AT SEA that wins the cigar hands down. To begin with this had to have taken the production several years of carefully and literally sorting through thousands of hours of film. The movie footage referred to here was the official filmed record taken by members of the Armed Forces of the United States independent newsreel film Motion Picture Record of our other Allied Partner Nations as well as captured Axis pictures from Nazi Germany Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan. Once that was accomplished the various corresponding film had to be cut and edited into a series of 1/2 hour installments. This was done with great skill being that there were so many scene changes whether done abruptly or as a dissolve. The look of ever episode appears as smooth as if it had been a single motion picture project. The writing of the Spoken Word to accompany this finest of real life film was no less amazing and unique. The highly polished and meaningful eloquence wastes not a word and at times even understates the description of action rather than exaggerating it. The narration goes to Mr. Ralph Graves who was a talented Actor of Stage Film Radio and Television. He certainly gained a measure of immortality by way of his golden toned voicing of the written episode descriptions. Lastly VICTORY AT SEA enjoys the luxury of having an original score both opening theme and incidental music penned by Richard Rodgers of Broadway fame.(Rodgers & Hart Rodgers & Hammerstein) His compositions are intricate full variable and even classic in the true sense. The Classical Arrangement was played by the NBC Sympphony Orchestra under the Direction of Robert Russell Bennett and as a soundtrack record/cassette tape/compact disk it has been continually available and in demand ever since its first release 55 years ago! And really small wonder for it is this musical score that is so mesmerizing to the viewer/listener. It truly puts the frosting on this cake. * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL THE VALIANT YEARS also had a beautiful and highly memorable original score. This also was composed by Mr. Rodgers. ** We had in additional Ace in the Hole in our house in the person of our Father the Late Clement J. Ryan(1914-74). Dad had been in the U.S.Navy during the war being inducted in 1943 or'44. Our Pop was always on hand to explain and further elucidate any of the situations that were depicted in the series. He and our Mother the now 90 year old Bertha (nee Fuerst)Ryan already had my older sister Joanne(1942-90)as a Dependant. ,positive

 Dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero who takes down the man meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide. Mind you that these women know karate and are fine foxy ladies. SPOILER--the end fight scene is pretty crazy with Dolemite ripping the heart out of Willy Green. Make sure your copy is unrated. Plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the Hamburger Pimp Reverend Mayor Queen Bee and others. The apparel is great and the sets are full of 70's style. There are a few mess-ups in the production such as boom mikes accidentally appearing among other things but that adds to the charm and laughs. I would recommend drinking a 6-pack before and during this movie and keeping squares and the man a far distance away. ,positive
 Jessica Bohl plays Daphne the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school. Daphne's neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage) a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife. Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness. Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan yet details of each character's history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks. Their appointment climaxes with the story's concluding twist. Both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance. Their on-screen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine. The film's dialogue is natural real to life. The writer Gorman Bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate. Daphne is intelligent yet clearly still an eighteen year old. Buddy may be middle-aged but still not the hackneyed naïve type normally depicted in film. Daphne and Buddy's conversation primarily deals with their despair and frustration with life but is still comical at the right times. Although the general mood is very relaxed the dialogue has its own vivacity forcing the audience to become empathetic toward the character's conditions and uncomfortable at their straightforward vulgarities. The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film. Each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters. Even existing independently from the film the compilation truly expresses You Are Alone's central theme-- loneliness. You Are Alone is a less conventional piece that deals with of notions typically not spoken. Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness. ,positive
 Well acted drama based on a novel by Arthur Miller. Something as simple as a pair of glasses becomes life altering. Lawrence Newman(William H. Macy)is a man that has chosen to be satisfied with his mundane life; the same job for twenty years and still living with his mother. He is told by his boss to correct his vision with a pair of glasses. Newman's life drastically changes and delves him into hell. The glasses he chose makes him look Jewish. He looses his job and becomes the object of heavy scrutiny by his Brooklyn neighborhood. Searching for a job he encounters the attractive and outspoken Gertrude(Laura Dern) herself living with conflict because of her Jewish appearance. Soon the couple's new life together becomes a nightmare filled with humiliation and bigotry driven attacks. A very apt cast that features: Joseph Ziegler Peter Oldring Kay Hawtrey and of musical fame Meat Loaf. ,positive
 Far more sprightly and less stage and set bound than Gene Saks' previous efforts Barefoot in the Park(67) and The Odd Couple (68) Cactus Flower is not a work of art but compared to most of the tired farces from the 60's like The Apartment How to Murder Your Wife Goodbye Charlie A Guide for the Marrried Man Divorce American Style Any Wednesday Kiss Me Stupid Boys Night Out it's a masterpiece. Director Saks and writer I.A.L. Diamond have effectively opened up Abe Burrows' Broadway hit and the film benefits greatly from New York City location shooting and excellent performances from Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is charming looks great and demonstrates a flair for comedy. Hawn in her Oscar winning role has never been better or more appealing. Matthau is OK though it's hard to believe that Hawn's character would be so enamored of him. And in retrospect Hawn's attempted suicide at the start of the film is out of character and unbelievable. Nonetheless the film has a plausible farcical set up and once it gets going it generates laugh. Rick Lenz Jack Weston Eve Bruce and Vito Scotti provide good support. The film is likable and fun and Hawn and Bergman make you care. ,positive
 I thought that i wrote a comment on this movie before but i can't find it on here. anyway i am writing it again. I accidentally found this movie from my college's library collections. It was free to watch so why not. I am certainly glad that I watched it. I love this movie. I have seen a few Russian movies before most of them have serious topics. I am surprised that this was one a good comedy. I had a great laugh while watching it. and this is a movie that i want to buy. this thing is so funny. and they are not just silly funny those plots were very original and well thought so they don't seem to be silly at all. I am surprised that this movie didn't attract many viewers. This is a classic that you can watch it over and over. those actors were also very authentic their acting are real not faked. if you haven't watched it go get a copy soon! definitely recommended. ,positive
 As a cusp-pre-baby-boomer ...born in 1944 IN Los Angeles; thereby having the dubious distinction of having been alive while Hitler was still actively involved in his Last Great Offensive; but also with our President Roosevelt still actively fighting the offensive...this was one of the most important first films of my young life. Having the opportunity to see it in re-release several years after the 1946 opening (a common studio custom in those years) answered (even to my very young mind)oh-so many questions I had...being surrounded by our returning Vet heroes. Ensconced in all the many of William Wyler's equanimity of subtle multi-plots ...intentionally NOT surrounding mini or sub plots...in all their colors and shades of intensity ...did more than anything else I can recall to provide to me some semblance of reason and rational explanation of what had been going on all around me...in REAL life. (My personal experience perchance being a new and different angle when looking at this classic film.) ,positive
 THE ASCENT is a very worthwhile addition to recent re-releases from the Soviet Union. Director Larisa Shepitko's 1977 film examines the moral ramifications of allegiance and honor in German occupied Russia during The Second World War. On foot and in a blizzard two members of a partisan Soviet group leave to locate supplies and are captured by Nazi soldiers. The focus of the movie is on how each man handles or internalizes his moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and integrity while the other opts for collaboration with the enemy. However in the end he cannot abide by his selfish decision. The film makes much use of slow wide-angle pans which shift to extreme closeups and highlight the spiritual quandary within the souls of each man. This is not a great film but it does effectively portray an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a harsh and frigid Soviet wilderness. ,positive
 A tough life gets tougher when the three children of a single mom are scheduled to be sent to separate foster homes after her untimely passing. To stay together the older boy plans a daring high risk escape to find a distant lost uncle- their only remaining next of kin. Their trek takes the three fearful runaways on a chase through the desert in a classic beetle penniless hungry desperate terrorized by delinquents and too young to drive hunted by the ever threatening civil authorities. What the movie lacks in acting and plot realism it makes up for in the honest human need to be a part of a fulfilled and complete family- even if that family is cobbled together with spare parts of broken lives. Sure the ending is forced and too over-dramatic for the critical movie goer but every heart beats the same cry for family togetherness and belonging. With all its weaknesses I still give this movie a strong recommendation. ,positive
 This is not a movie that I would typically watch at 2:30 in the morning but I got into it and couldn't stop until it was over. Shia LaBeouf demonstrated that he is not just a young actor here but could handle more demanding roles. The fact that he has been handed those roles in the last two years is testament to his ability. It was really his movie. Sure there were others involved but they pale in comparison to his role. This was a time when gold was reserved for the privileged. This victory opened it up to the masses much the way that Tiger Woods has opened golf to all races. Like Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) said to Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth): ...if Mr. Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) wins tomorrow it's because he's the best because of who he is. Not who his father was not how much money he's got because of who he bloody is! And I'll thank you to remember that. Go get charged up. ,positive
 The British noble Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene) decides to search his two best friends that have disappeared after visiting Count Karl von Bruno (Stephen MaNally) an evil and powerful man who lives in the Black Castle. Sir Burton travels undercover with another identity since he fought against Count von Bruno in Afrika with his two missing friends and the count lost one eye in a battle. When he arrives in the castle he is invited to hunt in the Black Forest around the castle with the count .while he looks for evidences that the count has killed his friends. Later he and the count's wife Countess Elga von Bruno (Rita Corday) fall in love for each other and with the support of Dr. Meissen (Boris Karloff) Sir Burton and the countess try to escape from the claws of Count von Bruno. The Black Castle is an excellent movie from a romantic time with action romance mystery and even horror. The story is gripping and is a great entertainment for any audience. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): O Castelo do Pavor ( The Castle of the Fear ) ,positive
 This is ten times better than Who Wants To BE A Super Model on Bravo I think it is more true to the business. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiring model. The photos look for depth in each of the models in personality and beauty strength and demure attributes and the ability to endure and work for what they want. I enjoy seeing Tyra's personal experience brought into the photo shoots and on the runway. I don't always agree with the judges decision's or Tyra's comments and at least one of the winners I feel did not deserve to win. But this is just a show and every girl on there is very lucky to have this chance. ,positive
 I can't explain it but I find this movie not only funny but so enjoyable I feel compelled to watch it over and over or at least I did when I had cable TV. I always felt it was a really poorly made movie but perhaps that is because I watched it on cable. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to really take an honest look at at but more importantly to just have a good time watching it. I liked the plot and the idea of the movie and I especially liked the cast. I always wonder if the cast enjoyed making the movies they are in and this is no exception. This film deserved a better fate than it received and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Ms. Holly. Who wouldn't? The characters in this movie were the kind of guys I could identify with when I was in the military and the zaniness was exact. Nice going troops. ,positive
 since the plot like Vertigo or Brian DePalma's Obsession till to the score by Peter Chase that reminds the sounds of Bernard Herrmann this little pearl seems to be sight from fews. Remarkable playing by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris portrayed from the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD are the french one and the English. Directed by a controversial artist as Gilles Mimouni it could be considered a little homage to the Cinema masterworks. It is a french movie and as all of them not for all we could say a d'essai cinema. Even if not so publicized it could be remembered for several reason. ,positive
 It's common knowledge and has been said before: No one can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (no longer Kilmer having been divorced from ex-hubby Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a re-make (God-forbid!!!) she still cannot rise to the occasion (i.e. her voice sounds evil on several occasions she's got brown eyes [Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green] and her vocal power was not up to the job either. Scarlett is a Southern Belle; therefore she has an incredible talent for flirting (as she did in SCARLETT the novel and GWTW of course) and to be a great flirt like Scarlett is you would most likely need a higher-pitched voice like Vivien Leigh. I suppose I'm comparing Kilmer to Leigh a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as Leigh did with Scarlett you simply can't help but to criticize any new prospective Scarletts. Timothy Dalton should have had no accent whatsoever due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell's Rhett and Gable in the film had none. His acting has never been truly noteworthy (except maybe his portrayal of the evil conniving King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and he gives very little (if any) freshness or vitality to his Rhett. Standouts in the cast are most notably Tina Kellagher (a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance) as the tragic victim Mary Boyle. And then of course there's Sean Bean as the cold calculating and not to mention almost demonically evil Lord Fenton Mary's nemesis and Scarlett's eventual violator. One thing I could not forgive the writer for was the fact that Scarlett is raped in this movie (a fact that never occurred in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and of ill-repute among the Irish in the book but he's nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart. Another omission from the novel but readded for the film is the character of Belle Watling played most horribly by Ann-Margret in a cameo role which we all could have lived without seeing as how the book was such a run-away bestseller without requiring any assistance from Ms. Watling. For a film by itself SCARLETT is a very good one but not quite in that lofty of a place in terms of being GONE WITH THE WINDs sequel. Another actress was highly necessary for Scarlett as well as Rhett. ,positive
 When I played the first Soul Calibur on dreamcast I thought it was great. When I played the second I was hooked. And finally when Soul Calibur III was released I bought a playstation 2 and the game. This can really keep you up for hours with a huge amount of characters loads of unlockable content and not to mention a GREAT fighting system this really is the greatest fighting game to date. The games strong points is foremost the vs. gameplay were two human players battle each other either playing as one of the main characters or as a created and customized character. The Create character option is vast and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations. The only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the fighting style Grieve Edge (only kicks) has to wear those ridiculous shoes. ^^ This is absolutely the greatest fighting game one could wish for. Now I'm just hoping the planned movie won't be crap. ,positive
 A stolen shipment of Vigoroso the mexican Viagra; a beautiful girl who is trying to rebuild her life and to leave her husband a boss of the italian Mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old sweetheart. This is the plot of The Shipment a country comedy located in small town of Paradise Arizona. Despite its simply and classic story the movie (directed by Alex Wright) has its fun moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (as Candy Porter) looking at a Vigoroso green pill says: What s this? A mint candy? . Or when the girl enters the sheriff s house and finds him completely naked. Or when the Vigoroso shipment ends up in THAT lake at the final sequence... The cast offers some nice performances: by Matthew Modine as the sheriff of Paradise Valley who still loves his old girlfriend; and by Elizabeth Berkley who s character still loves her old boyfriend... The supporting cast including Nicholas Turturro Paul Rodriguez (as the mexican Josè) and G Michael Gray (what kind of teeth...) makes a pleasant work too. Not an Oscar material but not so bad. A fun comedy without pretence. ,positive
 During WWII there were a bazillion movies created by Hollywood and after seeing many of them they start to seem alike. However OVER 21 is unique in so many ways as it shows a side of the war you won't see in other films--making it well worth seeing even if you have seen the bazillion other films! Alexander Knox plays the male lead but the real lead of the film is Irene Dunne--who looks amazing for a 47 year-old lady (yes I checked--she really was this old when she made the film). In OVER 21 the pair play husband and wife. He enlists in the military much to the consternation of his father (Charles Coburn) and owner of the newspaper where Knox is employed and most of the film takes place when he is in officers candidate school. The film shows little of Knox in the school but instead centers on Dunne as she lives in nearby spartan housing for spouses. During this time she (as the British say) keeps a 'stiff upper lip' and makes the best of it--even though she really isn't a housewife but a famous professional writer. Occasionally she gets very brief visits from her harried husband but most of the time is spent doing housewife duties and keeping the meddling Coburn at bay. Eventually she decides to stop the pesky Coburn from phoning incessantly (he ALWAYS complains that his paper won't survive without his son) by pretending to be Knox--writing wonderful editorials that everyone just assumes were written by him. While there is nothing earth-shaking in this film it's a very interesting slice of life move. Additionally the acting all around is very good. It's interesting that this film is a fictionalized reworking of the experienced of Ruth Gordon (a famous screenwriter) and her husband Garson Kanin (also a famous screenwriter as well as director). When Kanin joined the military during WWII Gordon soon wrote and starred in the play that became this film. By the way I noticed that some of the reviewers really liked the speech towards the end of the film and were inspired by it. While it was very good it was also very sad as all this hope for a better world following the war was short-lived. ,positive
 I'm afraid I must disagree with Mr. Radcliffe as although he is correct in saying this isn't a comedy it has many other merits. The plot is a little mad at parts but I believe it it all fits together nicely creating a satisfying enjoyable film. The last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting showing just what someone will do under stressful circumstances. I would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies but if you're a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don't expect expect something as deep as Goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable. ,positive
 If you love the book as I do stop watching the video after Jean and Joe meet in Australia. Up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 to that point and I've enjoyed it many times. After that the story is seriously rearranged and revised in ways that really destroy the key part of the book i.e. how Jean creates a town like Alice (Springs). In the early part the major change is to make Strachan a 40-something bachelor instead of a seventy-year old widower. This rather skews this love story especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and avaricious such as: in the book he intimates to Joe at the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in Australia but in the video he gives Joe no clue about Jean's whereabouts or intentions. The last hour of the 5-hour video scrunches and mangles the last third of the book. I see no reason why they threw in a fight between Joe and Jean -- it is quite out of character and seems to be just an Aussie dig at Pommies for telling them what to do. Then they bring on Strachan for the wedding (instead of some three years later) -- and have him read the toast!! -- very strange especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel as cast in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. These abominations take up time in the last hour which was already not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how Jean recreates Willstown as a place where she and Joe can both be happy. ,positive
 This is one of the best movies I've seen. The acting is good the plot is solid and the whole movie is very believable which adds a lot to the movie. I rate this at least a 9. ,positive
 Business vs. personal conviction. Profit vs. art. As with any documentary that pits the capitalist large corporations against the small producer the viewer will invariably have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes. This is as much a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold. If you have to remember one thing from this movie it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to equalize and standardize taste in the same way as MacDonalds used to do for the fast bite (something Parker himself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a Burger King sign). It is all about image against content as another interviewee says. That is the easy way the standardized way. Easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature easier than to forge your own taste by trying and trying yet over again. Controlled branded taste is easier. There is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are levelling the taste of wines to maximize the profits and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the grey masses . Individuality and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck. It is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to standardization even across the ocean. As in many other areas of today's world dominance of a few and reduced freedom of choice impacts us all... let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for. Too much standardization kills the mind and taste; difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice - and not just vacuum-packed more of the same . Standardization sells easily and a lot and brings everyone to the same level - the lower one. On this I am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a hearthy sante . ,positive
 Who doesn't love the muppets?! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside. So I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly. In fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the magic transcends all that other stuff. 'Tis indeed what movies are made of. So how does the film achieve these things? Hmmm nice question! Stumped am I? Let's see. Really I feel like it's quite simple. The filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. I probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack). A zest. You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing. Generally I get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel. Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. Lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through. The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. Maybe I don't feel I have much to say about it because I was half-asleep when I saw it (and/or as I write this review). Anyway I'm sort of semi-repeating myself here but I really liked the sense of family the movie had. Full of love I suppose you might say. Again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly. And to repeat myself once more one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly so The Muppet Movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so. Same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that. Anyway if that sounds sappy I also reckon it was pretty hilarious. So all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to. Plus it features lots of great music! Highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart. ,positive
 The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.' They are his first three-reelers which contain sustained more elaborate gags than he could usually orchestrate in his two-reel shorts at Mutual. It can be difficult to balance a pro-war message with slapstick antics and scenes of burlesque on the front but one wouldn't think so watching 'Shoulder Arms.' It's also preferable in many respects to a more serious dramatic work with a similar message such as Griffith's 'Hearts of the World.' Chaplin had become a true virtuoso of screen comedy by this time; he makes it look effortless. He knew very well by now that a film with fewer gags--with more elaboration refinement and careful timing--could be better than any knockabout Keystone-type farce with a dozen pratfalls a minute. The sequence where Chaplin is disguised as a tree is a pertinent example. Even with wars raging Chaplin can lift the spirits of millions. ,positive
 Chicago reporter Frank Quinlan decided to go to Iowa to confirm the existence of a so-called angel. He was not alone. His partner Huey Driscoll and new colleague Dorothy Winters also joined him. When they arrived at the destination they found that the angel Michael was quite different from what they expected. However Frank still persuaded Michael to go to Chicago with them. So an interesting journey began. Although Michael did not look like a saint he was a kind and funny angel. In fact Michael owned irresistible charming for women. Even due to jealousy of other men he was involved in a riot. The climax appeared in the pizza restaurant. Dorothy sang lively country songs for Frank. That was just what Michael wanted to see. But the next day Huey 's dog was crashed to death by a running car. Michael was asked to save it. That would be used to verify whether he was a real angel. Andie Macdowell shined in this comedy. She also showed her singing ability. John Travolta proved his comedian talent again. Of cause Pulp Fiction still was his typical work. A comedy that will warm your heart. 8/10 ,positive
 I saw this in a preview and it seems to have not been released in the U.S. Nonetheless it was one of the more enjoyable little comedies. It concerns the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small British town. The plot [of the movie] gets a little out of hand in the third act but the characters are very enjoyable and memorable. The acting is great across the board. Sure to be overlooked in the crunch of blockbusters this is a movie worth looking out for. I know I will try to catch this in the theaters again and/or buy the video. ,positive
 How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it. The first time I saw this I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny. While Robin Hood: Men In Tights is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by Real Genius ) it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes. ,positive
 Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is Juhi Chawla. Little does Juhi know in the film that Shahrukh has a MAJOR crush on her and is constantly stalking her. I have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy... like the threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the line I love you K..k..k..Kiran! It's just too bad that Shahrukh and Juhi weren't exactly together in the film. But Juhi and Sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie. Though Shahrukh's role was pretty psychotic I still think he did a great job of playing it and can't possibly imagine anyone else doing that role. No wonder he got an award for Darr in 94'! Juhi... what can I say??? She looks especially amazing in this film! It's not that she doesn't always look amazing in her other films but Darr did give the public a wonderful image of her! As for the music... it was excellent! Especially Jaadu Teri Nazar one of my all time favorite songs. I also thought Tu Mere Samne was quite nice also. A must see for everyone! Overall Darr deserves a 9/10! ,positive
 Set in Venice mainly on the Lido Visconti's Death in Venice is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice this is a film to cherish. Mahler's music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama. The mood it creates is not always happy. But then what else would you expect with a title like that? There is not a lot of dialogue in the film. Rather sparse in fact. It's mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests. The intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of glances between Gustav von Aschenbach a composer of some renown and a slim teenage youth Tadzio who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel dining room on the beach and at odd unexpected places around Venice. They seem to acknowledge each other's presence shyly at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile but later with a strong and riveting and urgent gaze. Each viewer will have his own interpretation. The composer has lost a child of his own. Is this behaviour an expression of yearning for the child he loved? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with his dazed somewhat girlish stare? Could he be discovering some new inspiration for a yet unwritten musical masterpiece? Who knows? From beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th Century Venice. The elegance of the ladies the deck chairs on the sand the children frolicking in their neck-to-knee bathing costumes the glow of sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world. While some may think the pace is rather slow at times the film has an overall gentle quality but with a simmering indecision between two repressed human beings. Be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending. ,positive
 If you can watch a Bond film from 1983 that isn't as good as Octopussy and still enjoy it. If you can accept production values which aren't that much above the level of a TV movie. If you can look at Sean Connery with wrinkles on his forehead beneath an obvious toupée and still see James Bond. If you can get past an inexperienced Basinger a weaker Largo and a jolly Q. If you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score not up there with Barry on his worst day. If you don't believe the hyperbolic reviews that it was greeted with on release. If you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same. Yours is Never Say Never Again and everything that's in it. And what is more you'll probably enjoy it my son! ,positive
 Watch it with an open mind it is very different nothing's cutesy about this. Very well done realistic tale of Tarzan. The animatronics chimpazees are well done for '84 Christopher Lambert was brilliant imitating chimpazee language and behavior. I wouldn't be surprised if he took lessons from Jane Goodall. ,positive
 What would it be like to be accused of being a subversive? This is what this film explores through the eyes of 2 characters one being the accused subversive the other being the interrogator. It is a frightening journey from the beginning to the end. This film is not for everybody and if you do not understand political governments thoroughly you will never get the point of this film as proved by 90% of the reviews here. ,positive
 A young Frenchman uproots himself as he becomes an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona and comes back a better man. Sounds boring? No way! The movie is filled with colourful people all of them stereotypes (the British twat and her racist brother the sexually liberated Dane the ultra-organised German ...). In this case though the stereotypes are brilliantly done. You feel like you know people like that (I for one know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife and they're just like the characters in the film!) they feel like REAL PEOPLE! Go see this movie and enjoy the subtitles! ,positive
 I absolutely love this film. Everything about it. It almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen. The way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece very original and creative. I related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some. I'm really glad I ran across this movie. If only there were more genius' like justin out there! ,positive
 For Estoninans Finland sometimes seems like a land of dreams. A land where many of us want to go and work there or start a business. Find love start a new life etc. But... Aku Louhimies has made this brilliant piece which shows that everything is not so good in Finland as well. That Finland can be just as Paha maa (The Bad Land) than any other country. It shows that people there can be just as miserable in their lives than we in everywhere else. That sometimes there's nothing good. This movie nicely shows why Finland is one of the top suicidal countries. It's not easy to live in North. Cold climate changes us. I've become more and more attracted to Finnish movies and this one is very good. The acting is great as well. Jasper Pääkkönnen has become one of the top Finnish stars. Beware of the sex scene (if you have little children) and a little depression that might come afterwards the movie! 8/10 ,positive
 Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny' 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion. In a brilliant Disney parody he hollers Pinocchio down the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. There are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' which as a child I used to impersonate regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name. I've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst McKimson's best. ,positive
 This is one of the most anti-traditional war movies about was I have seen. Instead of the typical films that stress glory and perhaps super-human characters (like John Wayne) this film is the exact opposite--stressing the de-humanization that ALSO happens in war. The story concerns the Japanese who are stranded in the Phillipines after the US returned in late 1944-early 1945. By the time the movie begins the Japanese have clearly been beaten but because of the insane logic of Bushido they cannot allow themselves to consider surrender. At one of many poignant moments the lead character is told at the beginning of the film to report to the hospital since he isn't capable of fighting due to his TB. The problem is that the hospital won't accept him so his commander tells him to once again go to the hospital--and if they won't accept him he should blow himself up with a grenade! Well this happens just in the first five minutes of the movie--a lot worse things befall this soldier and the few stragglers because they won't surrender. Plus there is a case in the movie where a soldier DOES try to surrender but is gunned down. This happened a lot later in the war because so often the surrendering Japanese soldiers booby-trapped themselves to blow up when they came near. In addition the film shows the most vivid depiction of starvation and the accompanying madness of any film I have seen. In addition cannibalism cowardice and betrayal all accompany this very gritty realistic and depressingly realistic film. You simply couldn't have made a better film of this type. Horrible but great. ,positive
 A lot of people say the end did not make sense but it did. With the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off having picked up a lot of Lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to re-energize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. It seems they do not have carnal sex like vampires of legend. vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous but killing them with with a shot to qui force center below the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer has to suspend disbelief even for scifi. The only problem is having to be a sword or stake not bullets. That puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci-fi. So that is a problem. The only major inconsistency I found is killing the male vampires with the sword but the soul of the girl and Carlsen go up to the ship. I assume the males souls also went up the ship but not shown. What about all the humans killed? Do their qui forces ( souls ) go up to the ship as discrete entities are does all the lifeforce get merged into one for use as ship sees fit? In other words all the human souls that went to the ship could be re-incarnated as bat creatures. The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars Force or even re-incarnation. This movie was over the top kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula) but in many ways profound. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and end were ethereal. It both began ( what is happening to me ) and ended as a love story. Most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre.So what? Bizarre is an art form. As far as being ludicrous it all fits. The plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the Aliens just killing people. Maybe they didn't need Patrick Steward's blood to form an image of the girl but it was a very far out surreal scene. Another reason the movie is hated is because of the end. But the end fits perfectly with the beginning. People are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core. Its a lover story from start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster and this movie did not end that way which is precisely why I love it. Instead it has a happy ending with the 2 of them going back to ship to be reborn. Way cooler than the hero kills monster end but that is exactly why it bombed. It was not a straight-up horror or even scifi/horror at all but a love story with a beautiful beginning and end. All those souls twinkling on the ship. And the crystal room pulsating with new life. Most people can't deal with a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula. ,positive
 The film Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a film to be honest I had ever really heard of until the Film Forum in NYC said that they would have a 2-week screening of the film with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was in the vein of the classic French crime films ala Jean Pierre Melville I jumped at the chance to check it out (at best it would rank up with his great works and at worst I would get some good popcorn in a great theater). It was well worth the admission as Classe tous risques is one of those kinds of French films that is just waiting to be re-discovered (or discovered for the first time). With terrific tense diligence Sautet keeps the suspense at a tight pitch for the first forty minutes of the film keeping a good (if not great) middle section and then ending it up with what is always expected with these films but with fascinating motivations by way of the characters. With a film in the vein of this sort you know how it will end but it's the cool observant journey that counts. The film features a performance with some real truth and honesty amid the old-school criminal's code by Lino Ventura as Aldo who at the start of the film (one of the best beginnings to a film in this genre and country) steals a hefty amount of money with his partner in crime). When there is a sudden ugly twist of fate on a beach late one night Aldo is again on the run with two little kids. He gets the aid of Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo a role in tune with Le Doulos only with a smidgen more humanity and charisma) who is also a thief and drives him into Paris. But there are some problems with some of Aldo's old business partner's and one old score may be just the right ticket. A couple of times the plot may seem to be leisurely but it isn't. Like Melville Sautet doesn't allow any fat to his story and it's a very tightly structured film with some good doses of humor here and there (I was sometimes grinning at the audacity of the criminals in the beginning chase sequence and also with a particular woman who had a finicky thing with her cat and a fish). Along with a fine score by the great George Delerue exceptional cinematography and a mood that is seldom met let alone matched now adays Classe tous risques is a reminder of that bridge between the real old-school film-noir and the latter day crime films. Gangsters in these new sort of thug-life movies have a 1000th of the class and honor of the thieves in this film and is a second banana to the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment I assure you). That it has a good realistic moral edge helps as well. ,positive
 As John Grierson pointed out: The documentary genre can be defined like this: the creative interpretation of reality This fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time a computer-generated project about dinosaurs respects the intelligence of the viewer. When I saw Jurassic Park which I was expecting with great excitement I was left extremely disappointed. Of course the dinosaurs were great but the story-telling was unnecessary. I thought: What if they made a documentary on dinosaurs with no crying children or bad puns just dinosaurs made as realistic as possible to let us marvel at what was once reality. My dream came true. The BBC has produced an exhilarating documentary exploring the different eras of the dinosaurs. This part is to all the people that seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess at many points concerning the behavior skin patterns etc: Of course they have to. Nobody was there. I think it is fantastic that they could present something as realistic as that. The guessings are all based on the knowings of many paleontologists and it allows the viewer to have a pretty good idea of what it was like. If you wanna stick to what we know for sure then just go visit a dinosaur bones museum. That is why I incorporated the Grierson quote at the beginning of this comment. Anyway hats off to the creators of it. ,positive
 Wonderful family film that should be a staple at Christmas time. It's a mystery to me why it isn't. A true lost film that I first encountered flickering away on my old 19 black and white RCA when the Million Dollar Movie was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York City. This Rudolph Mate directed fantasy should be nestled under everyone's Christmas tree. But it has never been released on home video. Too bad. I believe I saw part of it on AMC a few years ago before they cut many of their older films from the rotation. TCM should take up the slack and play it at Easter or on Christmas Eve. Any movie with Santa Aunt Bee the Hostess Cupcake Lady and an actor with the first name King can't be bad. Ann Blyth as Sally is a bundle of energy. During her school years she rushes over to the chapel to pray for St. Ann to help and give guidance to her mixed-up and financially strapped family. It works. So after she graduates she places a statue of St. Ann in her own bedroom. At one point the entire O'Moyne residence is moved to another address. I think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the O'Moynes and the dastardly fellow next door. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep. All-in-all this is a satisfying movie experience. ,positive
 This early Warner Brothers talkie Son of the Gods (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that Anglo-Saxon Americans show towards the Chinese. Chinese-Americans are treated like second-class citizens and whites hold them in nothing but contempt. Prolific scenarist Bradley King based her screenplay on Rex Beach's novel about a young impressionable Chinaman Sam Lee (Richard Barthelmess of Only Angels Have Wings ) who experiences racial prejudice first-hand when the girls that his college chums bring along for a party reveal their racist sentiments about Sam once they learn about his heritage. Sam goes to his father Lee Ying (E. Alyn Warren of Gone With The Wind ) who is a wealthy Chinaman with offices not only in New York City but also in San Francisco. Sam feels deeply wounded by the racial slurs and he wants to leave New York and go where he cannot be hurt by Americans. His patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. Sam has yet to learn this lesson. He refuses to take any more money from his father and catches a ship to London England peeling potatoes while he is on board. During the trip he encounters a British playwright Bathurst (Claude King of Arrowsmith ) who needs some help writing a play about the Chinese. Sam and he strike up a friendship and Sam furnishes him with cultural information about Asians. While they are relaxing in France Sam meets a beautiful young woman Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett of Two-Faced Woman ) who falls madly in love with him. It seems that Allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel. Everybody at the motel knows about Sam being a Chinaman with the exception of Allana. Sensitive about his racial heritage Sam holds Allana at arm's length until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him. They fall madly in love together. Allana's father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that Sam is a Chinaman and all the memories of living in San Francisco and dealing with coolies floods Allana's mind. She storms into the dining room at the motel and publicly flogs Sam with a riding crop in front of a room filled with on-lookers. Of course Sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. He thought that Allana loved him but she didn't. About this time Sam's father Lee Ying falls tragically ill and Ying's secretary of sorts Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn of Iron Man ) sends Sam a telegram about Ying's illness. Predictably Sam rushes home to New York to be at his father's side. Since his public humiliation Sam has vowed to show no kindness to Anglo-Saxon Americans; Eileen is an Irish-Catholic and probably one of his few white friends. Lee Ying dies and Sam assumes control of the business and he practices his anti-White racism until he learns that he was an Anglo-Saxon foundling that a San Francisco cop on the beat gave to Lee Ying and his wife to bring up. The cop forgot about it until two white busy-bodied social worker types wanted to take Sam away from the Yings. Sam learns this revelation about the same time that Allana comes to New York and falls ill. During her illness she utters his name repeatedly in her sleep and her devoted father goes to see Sam and requests that Sam visit her in order to help her recover. Unbeknownst to Allana Sam does visit her and she improves but she has no memory of his visit merely a hazy notion. Eventually Allana learns the truth about Sam not being a Chinaman and they marry and live happily ever after. This socially conscientious Warner Brothers/First National Pictures Release contends frankly and unflinchingly with the race issue for the first hour or thereabouts before the revelation that Sam has no Chinese blood running in his veins catches both him as well as the audience by surprise. The reconciliation between Allana and Sam stretches credibility despite their self-professed undying love for each other. However in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it they wind up in each other's arms. The capitulation on the race issue with the revelation that Sam isn't Chinese damages some of the film's moral power. Incredibly Son of the Gods is a Pre-Code film that almost seems prudish; for example Sam is an American not Chinese! Constance Bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautify and she holds your attention when she whips Sam with her riding crop. Claude King is good as Bathurst and E. Alyn Warren is convincing as Lee Ying. Interestingly Warren made a career out of portraying Asian characters. Richard Barthelmess is flawless as Sam; he delivers a highly nuanced performance. Despite its age Son of the Gods is a son of a good movie! ,positive
 For every fan of coming of age tales this 3 hour adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel is pure fun. Cinematic nods to Baz Luhrman's kinetic style as well as to all those prim and proper period pieces ever present on the BBC (where you're likely to have seen almost every prominent member of this cast). It's rather bawdy and over the top in spots but that's just what the novel called for. The cast is appealing and in the cases of Anna Chancellor and Hugh Bonneville perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling as our heroine Nan you simply must overlook the fact that she's far too pretty to ever be mistaken for a boy and run with it. It's a fantasy after all. Some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes in character (particularly that of Jodhi May's character Florence) but the changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay and provide an overall high quality entertainment value. ,positive
 This show is awesome! I love all the actors! It has great story lines and characters. It is the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have great dialogue. They both can be really funny.I miss Vanessa Marcil on General Hospital but she's great on here. James Lesure is great! He can be hilarious. Molly Sims plays a dimwit very well. The writing is awesome!They keep up an excellent pace. The show can really leave you hanging which is one of my favorite elements of a show. I cannot wait until the new season starts. This show makes it to the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show stays on for a really long time. If people know what good is it will. I never want the show to end. Ever. ,positive

 I gave this movie a 10 simply out of my sick obsession with Ingrid Bergman:) lol. I really think she was the best actress to ever grace this earth with her talent and all of her movies are absolutely wonderful (even when they are awful) because SHE is in them. If it hadn't been her and Vivien Leigh (as it had originally been desired I hear) I would have given it a 9.0 Simply because I love Viv but probably not as much as I love Ingrid. And any other actress would have made it maybe a 6. It's a good story two wild people falling in love in a society where it bad to be bad. Reminds me a little of GWTW except laced with a more highbrow attitude. Gary Cooper is very handsome as usual and of course his voice never changes the entire film but hey Ingrid makes him seem so amazing and dashing and 20 times hotter than he probably should be. ,positive
 This is a great film for pure entertainment nothing more and nothing less. It's enjoyable and a vaguely feel-good movie. A minor but nonetheless irritating thing about the movie is that we don't know why Justine and Chas broke up. Okay most first relationships don't work for one reason or another but they more or less seemed like a nice couple. In a nutshell it's worth a watch to escape reality. ,positive
 Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids. The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately in so many ways this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. Late in the film his being annoying abrasive and needlessly cruel seemed to have diminished. While all this didn't make him a particularly nice man it is important to capture on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. I really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artists actual works were shown throughout the movie (like in LUST FOR LIFE). I really wish I could show this to my students (I teach at a school for the arts) but can't because there is just too much adult material. Yes there is nudity but even more problematic for any audience (particularly younger ones) is when he ....hmmm ...I don't think IMDb will even let me describe what occurred but it was very graphic and involves bodily fluids. Not only a nasty and disgusting scene that did NOT need to be seen but a reason to keep junior from watching this otherwise wonderful film. It's a real shame. ,positive
 Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Much reviled when it first appeared (inspiring the famous review 'Me No Leica') this precursor of Cabaret can now be looked at in comparison and it's not half bad. It's certainly no classic but it has its own wayward charm (the film version of Cabaret follows this plot whereas the stage version changed the plot somewhat). One should of course resist the temptation to snicker when Laurence Harvey's Christopher Isherwood (it keeps the original author's real name; God Knows what Isherwood thought of it) describes himself as 'a confirmed bachelor' and while Harvey is an utterly inadequate 'hero' (he's virtually asexual) and Shelly Winters woefully miscast as Fraulien Landauer (the part Marisa Berenson played in Cabaret ) Julie Harris is a perfectly marvellous Sally (it's a lovely piece of comic acting) and Anton Diffring is first-rate as Fritz the German-Jew in love with Shelly's character. Of course if Cabaret had never come along you might ask yourself would this ever have seen the light of day again. That it has been revived may not quite be cause for celebration but it's perfectly acceptable all the same. ,positive
 This is a piece of cinematic beauty and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province. It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived breathed and ate everything Maurice Richard. The book does this as well as the short and I'm glad that in all the time I did spend studying French in high school this was required reading in both languages. I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier narrate this story. His molasses-thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story. The animation was good as well very surrealist which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream fancying over better days gone by. Again as a symbol of culture quebecoise this is unsurpassed. One can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove. This whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be Canadian and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots. I'm from Ontario and this film made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs. ,positive
 It has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better bargain bin movies out there - I'd feel a bit cheated if I had paid £15 for it but at about £1.50 I felt that I definitely got more than my monies worth. The film can't quite decide if it wants to be Mad Max or one of the Clint Eastwood man with no name spaghetti westerns and as such is stacked with clichés from both. Even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in Mad Max is there. That guy from Blade Runner also cops a good billing although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie. Favourite bit - for me the punch-up on top of the oil refinery - if you look closely you can see the post-apocalyptic rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each other. Get several lagers in a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel. ,positive
 I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said in some of these other fine and quite hilarious comments but Ill try. So you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that absorbs and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever (or whatever) lays on it with its orange soda-filled body. We have the man in some scenes looking uncannily like Robert Smith of The Cure hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goings-on and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed. This is no ordinary bed. No sirree Bob! Not only does it eat people but it cleans up after itself draws the covers back and it even makes itself. Who wouldn't want a bed like that? It can even use its sheets as a rudimentary lasso to wrangle escaped victims back in (especially if they're taking up half the length of the film to try and escape). Our main story (if you can call it that) is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to house-sit(??). I don't recall exactly but it doesn't really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other; the characters talk to each other seemingly by telepathy as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls believes she isn't liked by the rest of the gang and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an echoey voice-over but we don't care; character development was thrown out the window a LONG time before in this film so why start now? There are scenes when the bed laughs snores crunches and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our cast's non-reaction to said noises cant be heard. This and the telepathy makes the issue of diegesis very difficult to ascertain...but thats OK....this is Death Bed: The Bed That Eats and it defies all logic so its OK. It makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film If you buy (hehe buy...did I say buy ?) this DVD make sure to check out the introduction by the director. He explains that the filming of this flick started in 1972 didn't wrap up until 1977 he shopped it for a few years with no luck and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on DVD. Supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made bootleg after bootleg of it and it was quite by chance on a message board no less that our director found evidence that people knew and gasp! cared about his little-known film. Its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it. I'm glad he did. Once you've even so much as heard the title to this film you MUST see it. I for one am going to buy this and I'm going to preach its gospel around the world...starting with this comment ,positive
 I saw this film many years ago and absolutely hated it -- I could not wait for it to end and would have walked out but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this film and more I would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years. How many movies have I wept over and laughed over in the moviehouse then forgotten as soon as I hit the street like ... you see I can't even think of one! Rarer are films like Death in Venice that enter your consciousness and work sea changes. The French like to say film is an art and movies like this one prove they are right. I give it 10 stars up from the 3 I gave it the night I saw it. ,positive
 As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable) King of Queens is a very original unique and astoundingly funny alternation. It's about the daily life of a deliveryman and his wife who works as an attorney's assistant in Manhattan in Queens NY. With them lives Carrie's father Arthur a picture-book extrovert who is played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears. Other important people are their best friends Deacon and Kelly a married couple and their other friend Spence who's almost 30 and still lives with his mother. What makes this show so unique and funny is above all that every single character seems so real and Carrie's cynical sarcastic attitude is the total opposite of Doug's good-natured slightly dumb optimism.And Arthur's the one who makes it absolutely unpredictable with his strange ideas and habits. He often gets himself into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to drag him out of the mud. Even if in my opinion the quality of the show decreased a little within the last years it's still one of the best daily sitcoms ever made. It takes a little time to get into the characters and relate to them but after that's done you get some unstoppable laughs from it. Although I think I couldn't survive one day with Arthur in a closed room without beating the guts out of him I really adore him in this show. Watch and have fun I give it a 9 out of 10. ,positive

 I first seen this movie like a year and a half ago and I loved it I decided to get the DVD last year for my birthday.. It has the right amount of suspense action and drama.. This movie is about prep school called The Regis School and its packed with rebellious kids in which one kid William Tepper (Sean Astin) has a hard time adjusting due to prior rejections from other schools cause they couldn't control his rebellious act and now at The Regis School committing more acts of a rebellion there school gets taken over by terrorists on a random day and which the real reason is because the leader Luis Cali's (Andrew Divoff) father has been sent to prison and the leader will do anything including killing the students setting bombs and so forth in order to get his father back. Along side William Tepper is his rebellious friends at the Regis School one in particular is Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) in which this guy holds a troubled past of living in a Mafia family and being sent to The Regis School because of hating his father for who he is and which now he must deal with these terrorists taking over the school so William Joey and there friends must band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and hazardous tactics. This movie was really awesome and I believe people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say Die Hard and even though I would have to agree with them they need to recognize that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller it sure had my heart beating because the students are my age and I would be scared to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school ... But overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and If I had a decision to rent or buy it... I WOULD BUY IT! I recommend it with a lot of hype! 8/10 ,positive
 This is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account. Let's filter the more judgmental..Ok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you withstand an independent low-budget film? Are you objective enough to NOT dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look? Well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography. It isn't a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film Dahmer (2001) was. The movie begins with Dahmer played quite convincingly by Carl Crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment. His thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a past-tense narrated style that accurately explains much of Dahmer's psychoses and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times. We get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life. It isn't anyone's fault but Dahmer's that 17 people died but being a criminal psychology student I was pleased to more than just his animalistic side represented truthfully in this film. You see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers. It should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain. You do see two deaths that I remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid. While you don't see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both Crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene. And while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results. There is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesn't look to be exploitive. Besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible. Although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing. The film actually concludes before Dahmer's death in 1994 due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior. That's about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as I've stated very true to the facts. The film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters IS a bit hammy but it's not overboard. In my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of America's most remembered serial killers. I think it's safe to say the film is memorable as well and I respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent Carl Crew as Dahmer. ,positive
 I thought this movie was highly underrated. The subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange and I was put off at first but once I was watching the movie it didn't seem strange at all. I was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer and I couldn't wait to find out how it would end. Once it did end....I thought about it for a long time after. I was pleased with everything about K-Pax from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues to the ending. It's not an especially upbeat or happy film though it does make you chuckle from time to time but I found it to be especially entertaining and thought-provoking. I own it now and intend to watch it many times. ,positive
 I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating. It totally deserves more! Sure it's completely ridiculous but that's what it was supposed to be. Don't expect cinematic transcendence from a movie about beauty pageant contestants stranded on a Caribbean island! What you should expect is a huge spoof of pretty much every relevant sci-fi fantasy and block-buster movie in cinematic history and even references to other spoofers. All completely exaggerated and sometimes totally unnecessary but that's exactly what makes this movie stand out. If you like parodies and enjoy say Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers you're gonna love this. I sure did! ,positive
 This film directed by George Fitzmaurice who made so many excellent films is well up to his excellent standard. It is crisp witty with some wonderful lines and has the inimitable Ronald Colman in the romantic lead. Colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy English peer. He is financially irresponsible (spending for instance £15 of his last £20 in the world on a cute little terrier whom he names George) but open wildly generous contemptuous of lucre irreverent in the politest possible way and hopelessly sentimental. He is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of the music halls and hence in 1930 a denizen of the demi-monde played with her typical svelte narrow-eyed silkiness by the youthful Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a great user of closeups and gals of that day had their faces half-hidden with those awful clinging hats anyway so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two heroines as we would like. The director seems more interested in the charming Colman anyway. The romantic female lead is the youthful and fresh-faced Loretta Young who had not yet become the proto-Julie Andrews we generally know her as but was still a blushing girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing merrily and heartily the whole time. It is obvious that a character with her terrific sense of humour was needed to appreciate the snob-busting social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by Colman. The plot barely matters as is so often the case with these light and amusing films. This is just such fun. ,positive
 This movie is beautiful in many ways: the plot the depth of the characters the stunning photography and acting the kolossal-like scenes of battles (no computer graphics here just thousands of people). Someone said the story has something to do with the Sheakespearian tragedies. I find some connections with the Greek tragedy tradition too. The emperor extraordinarily acted struggles between power and love but he is forced (for the greater good for the will of his ancestors) to choose the power (and the loneliness the hate of his subjects and kins) as his destiny. He like Creon in Antigone was a good guy before becoming emperor. Once gained power he has to be merciless and cruel (with innocent children his mother his father etc.) to defend and expand the empire. Entrapped by power he becomes a monster. Overall The Qin emperor is a majestic Greek tragedy figure. The assassin evolves towards a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Even this character is forced towards his destiny by love and by his new ethics. This character is really unforgettable too. Lady Zhao a wonderful Gong Li is the uncorrupted morality nor by power or love or hate. She is morality against power somehow like Antigone. Her conspiracies (for and against the emperor) have always a moral rationale. In conclusion a wonderful movie. If you love cinema and you want to try Chinese movies you can start here. ,positive
 I have seen this film at least 100 times and I am still excited by it the acting is perfect and the romance between Joe and Jean keeps me on the edge of my seat plus I still think Bryan Brown is the tops. Brilliant Film. ,positive
 This short was the first short released by Paramount Famous Studios and was one of several done by the studio showing Popeye engaged directly against the enemy most often the Japanese. While Warner Brothers Disney and to a lesser extent other studios did shorts often depicting Germans as foils the majority of Famous Studios efforts focused on the Japanese. Given Pearl Harbor and Popeye's naval ties this is quite understandable. This is an average short. Seein' Red White an' Blue and Spinach For Britain have aged better. But it's still worth watching. Recommended. ,positive
 I first saw this on Demand. Or on TV. I'm not really sure. But this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever! I mean this movie has blood gore laughs and chills through out the movie. I recently ordered Monster Man from Amazon and i've been watching Monster Man ever since i got it. Trust me you will love this movie. P.S. The commentary on the DVD is way funny. They also said something about Monster Man 2 during the commentary. Let's hope they make Monster Man 2 ! If you have the chance rent the movie or buy it. You will absolutely LOVE it! This is the best movie that has come out in 2003. 10/10 ,positive
 Although perhaps not as entertaining as some of Herzog's work Little Dieter is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists. Departing from Herzog's usual themes Little Dieter is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to go on living after a life-alteringly traumatic experience. Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from a very young age and the Viet Nam war gave him that opportunity but instead of spending the war soaring in a cockpit he spent most of it grounded as a POW. Dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately with occasional help from Herzog. Herzog does very little voice over this time but contributes a lot of subtly powerful soundscaping and visuals - which should be no surprise to those familiar with him. Dengler is a fascinating and extremely likable person. As human and as alive as they come I found the story of his life and his incorrigibly upbeat personality to be inspiring. Thanks to Herzog for (re)introducing him to us. The scale of the film is not as sprawling and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made Herzog a force to be reckoned with. Nevertheless I strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries. It's a very interesting and well executed film. ,positive
 when i was a child this was the movie i watched. i think it is a great movie for the kids to watch and parents don't have to be afraid of any violence or obscene images. rainbow brite is a cheerful young girl and she is trying to make the winter go away. she finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it for themselves. i love this movie and i think that even adults can enjoy this movie. ,positive
 Now this is more like it!One of the best movies I have ever seen!Despite it made very well on all aspects this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate.Loosen up!There are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand how entertaining and how captivating this movie was!Now this is what a movie ticket is all about!You will get exacty what you want from this movie's genre and all naysayers are those with the anti-Flynn syndrome.This conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti-Elvis anti-Ali anti-Clinton anti-Kennedy syndromes usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs.If the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art you will find this movie not only one of the best classics but also one of the best movies of all time.I rate it the second best western ever right behind Wayne's The Cowboys........ ,positive
 Based upon the novel The Dismissal by Ermanno Rea in essence the story's about the slow friendship that develops between an Italian maintenance technician Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto who can be seen as the villainous King in Prince Caspian and was the lead in Bella Martha) and a Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They set off actually on the wrong foot with the former chastising the latter for her inaccurate and slow translations of what he wanted to tell a Chinese delegate who had bought equipment that is faulty. Vincenzo wants to do the right thing which is rare in these days and that is to tell the prospective buyers upfront the faults as well as the intricacies that their purchase would bring and given that he's disturbed by the fact that the deal still went ahead he takes time off to craft a component that would set things right. But that also means to travel to China in search of the elusive machine which proves to be well hidden and seemingly having vanished without a trace. With the initial reluctant help of Liu Hua they set off in this treasure hunt from city to city which brings us to lesser seen sights of China away from the Beijings and the Shanghais to cities like Wuhan with industrial like backdrops such as steel mills and nuclear plants with their smoke stacks dotting the scenery. The mighty Yangtze River also makes an appearance. Along the way the usual trappings of such travelogue styled movies come into play such as the learning of culture ideals food and basically the understanding that the world is without strangers if only one makes an effort to try and connect. While hints of some romance between the two leads are suggested it rarely made itself to be a moot point until perhaps late in the movie (hey opposites attract no?) Besides the major industrial plants and factories We get to see various cottage industry like seamstresses working in sweat shop like environments and I believe Cotton too along with noodle making. As a film it provided me the travelling opportunity without leaving my seat to observe and credit to it for not passing judgement from a moral high ground on exploitation and the likes. And kudos too for the movie to engage in dialogue based on the characters' native tongues rather than (and I shall not name names here) some other movie / cross-cultural collaborations where dialogue is forced-dubbed and came off unnatural and truly irksome. Some might deem the supporting characters to be too kind too always opening their arms and doors to a foreigner but I would like to imagine that maybe in the more rural areas people in general tend to be more sincere friendly and basically not get caught up in the rat race to trample on others or be trampled upon. If there's a message to take away from the movie besides the fact that I mentioned that the world is without strangers is a reminder to myself that some of the stuff I deem important may not be so to others. Importance is something one places upon something else and its basis really depends on how we define the boundaries we set. So given our finite lifetime I think I should lighten up a bit more live and let live and sometimes bask in the illusion that ignorance could be bliss. ,positive
 From the offset I knew this was going to be a terrific movie the pace the cinematography personalities indigenous to the Dallas area the diversification of characters not to mention the director Oliver Stone and of course Eric Bogasian...The film starts out on a Friday (suggestively occult in the first place) and begins with a radio station in Dallas that is hosting their number one talk show The Barry Champlain Show (Based on the Talk Radio Host Alan Berg)...Barry (Eric Bogasian) is the abrasive radio talk show host and his job is such whereby it is compulsory to pontificate all of the sensationalistic nuances of the radio audience feeding into his show...He attempts to commiserate with a bunch of societal deviates turned lonely vulnerable obscene phone callers who have the masochistic craving to be publicly vilified Barry Champlain is effective in coping with this precarious ilk by socially debasing them rather than simply subjugating them to mere admonishment...New technologies serve a stigmatic purpose for the Dallas radio audience and paramount concepts take a backseat to perversion talk about Baseball Scores Orgasms and People's Pets!! The whole thing is a cacophony of drug-induced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia!! This high profile cannon fodder is something that Barry Champlain thrives on!!! The convoluted pathos the deranged proclivities deeriving from inaneities and puveyors of pornography and the overall pop culture afflictions serve as volatile ammunition for Barry Champlain's stilted battleground!! The setting for this movie is perfect in that there is a two thousand foot drop in terms of ideology.. In the the center of Dallas there is an overbearing sense of cosmopolitan awareness whereby 20 miles away resides a significant chapter of the Ku Klux Klan!!...The play is based in Denver that is where the actual story takes place other small theater plays depict the cities of Louisville Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the film takes place I thought it was an excellent choice!!...This movie illustrates how people have a horrid and erroneous and deadly misconceptualization of the Jewish people in America whereby they control the banks their agenda is different than everybody else's and their intellectual literature leads to perversion!! These preconceived notions compound Barry Champlain's overall dilemma!!! Barry Champlain's personal undoing is whereby he is irascible and non-responsive to his alcoholism and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate undoing this is what makes the film so believable!! The characters in the movie were well portrayed Dan the tailor made for middle management hatchet man (played by Alec Baldwin) who was constantly monitoring Barry Champlain's every move!!..Laura his girlfriend also his producer will constantly feel Barry is someone who is always misunderstood!! Ellen his ex-wife is a recipient of Barry's anguish and selfishness but cannot quite relinquish her feelings for Barry regardless of the path of personal destruction he winds up resorting to!! The Dallas radio audience is a melting pot of socially misplaced retro-bates who are dementedly amused by their own real shortcomings!!!...In part everybody's hang-ups including Barry Champlain's own hang-ups are what do Barry Champlain in!! His audience ogles depravity solicits amelioration and ultimately becomes Barry Champlain's pet project for prescribed sinners!! Social culture conflicts become Barry Champlain's downfall!! This movie is superb!! In my opinion Oliver Stone's best picture including Platoon and Natural Born Killers..That statement in of itself tells you how magnificent a film Talk Radio is...The story consulting and acting and co-producing of Eric Bogosian is simply compelling!! The camera angles the dialogue the haunting character portrayals all top notch..The cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the movie is terrific!! Dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolis...So now just like Los Angeles and New York there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from Hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next year!!!!...Dallas asserts it's status as a major metropolitan area in the precarious manner by which human debauchery prevails!! The city has it's lynching radio listeners who have given a pejorative spin to the marvel of nationwide air wave communication!! These are the culprits in the movie!! The ghoulish tabloid derelicts who want to meet the big bad wolf and their decadent curiosity has morally obliterated The last neighborhood in America  ,positive
 During the Civil war a wounded union soldier hides out in a isolated Confederate ladies' school; where the head mistress and the teacher of the school decide to care for him and keep him about until trouble starts brewing between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation but it all comes at a price in the end. Dirty Harry (1971) (which was made about the same time of The Beguiled ) might be my favourite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel but after seeing this I tend to think this to be the pairs' finest work together. A very atypical savvy and stylish vehicle for Eastwood is always on the mark with richly controlled direction by Don Siegel and a hauntingly rousing music score by Lalo Schifrin. Standing out strongly is its sultrily lurid and bleak nature that's intrusively planted into the film's psychological makeup and manipulative strangle hold in sexual depravity. It's assiduously played out and makes it more the brooding and blood curdling when those random shocks and saucy intentions take hold with gripping tension. The way Siegel illustrates John B Sherry and Grimes Grice's alluring bold slow-burn screenplay (taken from the novel of Thomas Cullinan) is effectively done through stark emotions and the script's tight lyrical context. Siegel's strong direction captures the idyllically southern Victorian setting with such potently garnished photography and he sets up some strangely piercing imagery with great clarity and restrained. While the performances are truly commendable and high of quality. Clint Eastwood as the smoothly suave sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured. A profoundly eminent Geraldine Page steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a delicate sincereness to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and Jo Ann Harris is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona. Honestly while Eastwood's charismatic character plays the field for his own selfish needs there's still mixed intentions there that the one's being played (where rivalry between the women creep in) turn out to be no better than their guest at the end. Throughout there's a perversely dark sense of humour and ironic touch settling into the material. What's demonstrated here is simply more than your basic little minded shocker but one that's thickly layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that's hard to shake. That also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song. A effectively chilling low-key item that's hard not to be tempted by it's swinging hospitality. ,positive
 The film begins with a dowdy housewife (Norma Shearer) finding out that her husband (Rod La Rocque) had been cheating on her. Three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity. Oddly during this time La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two kids as Shearer took them to Paris. Marie Dressler is a rich society lady and she has invited a new and improved Norma to come to her house for the weekend--ostensibly to help Marie break up a budding romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently Norma is now a super-vamp and with her magical sex appeal she can break up the romance--and no one seems to realize that she and La Rocque were married. Several others are there for the weekend and immediately Norma is a hit with her gay carefree sexy ways--and almost all the men (including La Rocque) are captivated by her. Neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex- wants the new and improved Norma back! This film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper-crust--similar in some ways to Jean Renoir's THE RULES OF THE GAME. Oddly despite the severity of the Depression such films about pretty rich folks were pretty popular though many today will doubtless find them a bit too droll in spots. However fortunately in LET US BE GAY there are plenty of cute and funny moments (particularly towards the end when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). While not a great film it certainly is a good one and more than just another time-passer. My only real regret is that I didn't love the very end. You'll just have to see it for yourself--perhaps you'll agree about the ending perhaps you won't but I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this clever film. ,positive
 An opera diva has an accident which leaves the door open for her understudy to take over the role. Betty (Marsillach) is now the star of Mac Beth but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out. He gets his kicks out of tying Betty up putting needles under her eyes (so she cant close them) and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyes. Opera is certainly one of Argento's more ambitious films like mixing it up with Shakesphere's Macbeth there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is Giuseppe Verdi's version of Macbeth but also Argento just like Shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and misfortune. And like the ravens circling the castle Dunsinane foreboding the demise of the scheming Macbeth the ravens in OPERA play a key part in the downfall of the killer. Furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the exhortation of his lover. But I don't want to go as far as saying OPERA is intended to be a remake of the either The Phantom of the Opera or Macbeth the similarities are far too subtle. It's just a typical Argento masterstroke and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of Gothic mystique. Although this movie does have it downsides like the heavl metal soundtrack just doesn't fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange. All in all Opera is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good. ,positive
 As a film buff I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon ). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation. HE really enjoyed it and - after trying to block out all the negative prejudices I obviously had about the film - so did I. There is nothing especially bad about Lost Horizon and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies. It isn't even especially camp. The lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them. As for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune this criticism falls apart since Liv Ullmann Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed (brilliantly too as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly) and Sally Kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style. Vocally Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on The Things I Will Not Miss is excellent. Special mention should be made of the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer's brilliant performance as the High Lama - and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to today's fractured world. I wouldn't claim for a second that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (The things I wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography and Bobby Van's Question Me An Answer number which could easily have been cut) but if you haven't even seen Lost Horizon or haven't seen it for some time try watching without that Oh boy let's have a laugh at this pile of junk attitude and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is. ,positive
 Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film but to live it. No other filmmaker is as crazed about the purity of the film-making process and the subsequent lore from such productions as Fitzcarraldo has been forged into cinematic legend. Today I sat down to Fata Morgana a 1969 Herzog film that could be described as an allegorical filmic postcard. Without researching the actual locations I'm assuming it was shot somewhere in Africa both coastal and desert a region that could have once been the cradle of infant man infant civilization infant life on earth. It is these origins the biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse that Herzog is concerned with as is voiced by the narration dispensed throughout the 79 minute run time. Watching FM I couldn't help but feel I was a passenger on a profound journey. In the opening sequence the title is translated as Mirage and Herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on an airstrip. These images are perverted their 3-dimensionality crushed flat by a long lens piling layers of exhaust heat waves and light aberrations all on top of one another. The effect left me to conclude: things are not as they seem. FM is divided into 3 very distinct chapters: 1) Creation 2) Paradise and 3) The Golden Age. Chapter One opens with countless languid images where bleak barren landscapes scroll by dead animals rot broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun. The people populating this inhospitable landscape are ragged unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the desert. The narration talks of a time before life a time where the canvas of earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens. While the narration hearkens to a simpler purer era a portrait of a young boy holding a fox-like animal by its throat evokes a chilling depiction of man's cruel ruthless attempt to enforce a dominion over nature. In the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same yet the images and people are more animated and seem infused with a modicum of life and vitality. We listen to a goggled biologist talk about the difficultly a monitor lizard has hunting for prey in such a lifeless environment. As he holds the squirming monitor its tongue flicking at flies he also describes how difficult it to capture these creatures in the searing 140 degree heat. The parallel is duly noted and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated candid portraits of individuals battered by the sun the desert and the laborious efforts required to exist in this harsh realm. He also pushes forward the theme that if not in control man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant of ways. The last chapter takes us out of the desert's blast furnace and into the more familiar Herzog territory populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior. No one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs of the world than Herzog -- possibly this is where he feels most at home. Much like Errol Morris Herzog chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective a position as he can before he lets the film roll. The subsequent flirtation Herzog has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have yelled cut. As Morris does this extended roll pushes past the on moment the subjects feel obliged to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime their facade gives way to something real. The most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2 person band playing an odd polka-like song that Herzog recycles throughout this chapter. The drummer of the band wears the same goggles as the biologist as does another guy doing a magic trick begging the question: what's with the goggles? They definitely add some levity to the film but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance or is this just another example of Herzog's playfullness. The narration aside Herzog utilizes folk and blues music as the experimental documentary's soundtrack. Leonard Cohen grabs the most screen time two of his beautifully melancholic songs So Long Marianne and Suzanne. perfectly accompany the scrolling landscapes adding to the convincing feel that we are truly along for the ride. By the end of the journey Herzog comes back to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film: the distant framing of a lone vehicle traversing the endless desert engulfed by a water mirage that fills the horizon. Despite the overall bleakness of FM the crescendo of the film and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit belief that against all odds life will persevere and possibly even flourish. Having finished writing this post I referenced FM to discover that Herzog shot it in Saharan Cameroon only weeks after a bloody coup. True to his legend Herzog and his crew were arrested beaten and imprisoned. While imprisoned Herzog fell ill with Schistosomiasis a blood parasite. It's truly hard not to love such a hypnotic and austere film as Fata Morgana; knowing the filmmaker was willing to die to get it made only makes you respect it all the more. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/ ,positive
 A fun romp...a lot of good twists and turns! (and we were not even baked!) Didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD...(oddly it was there along with The City of Lost Children and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen) The plot keeps you wondering throughout. The acting was awesome...Hank Azaria shows his talent again Bill Bob is Billy Bob...(wecis?) Definitely worth watching. ,positive
 First of all nothing will ever compare to the original movie but for gosh sakes they're not trying to. It is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett at Tara. I for one thought it was a terrific movie and would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie. Just view this movie as an extension of the original and don't think they are trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable and you will enjoy it a lot. They really captured the spoiled selfishness of Scarlett in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the looks from Rhett that he is clearly still in love with Scarlett. The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on TV. I always wanted them to have other children after Bonnie Blue died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly. Lore60 ,positive
 This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable so I started renting them because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap you know who's dating who that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship. Instead of the classic mother-daughter relationship it is a story of the best friend relationship-- about a mother and daughter. The characters are perfectly cast and all do a superb job. It is definitely the best TV show I have very come across. ,positive
 There is a version of Nevsky that is shown with a live symphony orchestra chorus soloist and the movie. If it's EVER performed within a day's travel of you see Nevsky done that way. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic did it with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the finest anywhere) a couple of years ago. I think I cried through the whole thing it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life. I'm listening to Nevsky on the radio right now and it still tears me up. There are movies that I love and classical music pieces I love but there is no combination I can think of that comes close to the impact of Nevsky performed in real time. ,positive
 ***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it SURFACE is superbly crafted. The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art. Conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents kids fantasy and/or fx fans). CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND by way of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON with a bit of JAWS and GODZILLA thrown in for good measure say. And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise either; some surprisingly solid casting here. This series SURFACEd seemingly from out of nowhere and by sheer dint of its straightforward storytelling carried the viewer along for the better part of an entire season. All things considered a job very well done. I only hope it reSURFACEs next season... ,positive
 I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo but upon further investigation they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I own a copy of this film too) The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany you will always find that in some strange way they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one. This film has everything in it from a jail break crooked southern politicians muses references to what I can only assume are historical figures riverside baptisms bank robberies violence towards animals singing flocks of religious fanatics KKK lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again as is usual for a Coen film I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing but I was. This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape. I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character. Now after heaping all this praise on the film let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only. Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself seen it seen it oh seen it last year that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coen's films. They have not been recycled and if they have I don't know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you don't get vision like this in many films so when you do enjoy it! ,positive
 I paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressions capability of the main actress Julianne Nicholson. I don't have words to describe how much have I been enchanted. All the actors and actresses played well. Especially I noticed the solid good character who has been consistent in foreseeing the future - Andy Richter who played Carl. I think that the idea to show a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions and the several consulting meetings is like the real world. Jay Mohr who played Ed the future husband also played very real behavior. But I want to emphasize again the point of very rich expressions repertoire which Julianne Nicholson is capable of and does so naturally was overwhelming for me. Indeed the subject which this movie handles seems to me as very important and touches strongly meaningful thoughts of many people. I've seen this movie several times and have not been bored. It raises again and again in my thoughts. ,positive
 I think that there was too much action in the end? Don't you think that too? There was romance adventure that just like told me to put 9 to this movie but action place was too long. I liked Reeve a bit. I didn't understand why did he have to die. I thought that one of the girls gonna die too but my lucky! No one else who I liked didn't die! How about you? What did you liked? I saw the movie twice actually. And after that I bought that too. It was worth it! Who did you liked best (person)?. The book was really really really cool. And the actresses and actors too. Everything was perfect....... What was the song name in the end? Will someone answer my questions too... PLEASE please please? ,positive
 This was very funny even if it fell apart a little at the end. Does not go overboard with homage after to Hitchcock - Owen (Danny DeVito) was lucky he had Strangers on A Train playing at the local cinema so the movie flat out tells you that that was the inspiration. DeVito is very funny but also a little sad. He has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing. His teacher Billy Crystal is going through some serious writers block of his own and his wife has stolen his book and made it her own success which also has him frustrated a great deal. Best parts are the book proposal by Mr. Pinsky ( One Hundred Girls I'd Like to Pork ) and all scenes with Anne Ramsey who is so horrible that even Mother Theresa would have wanted to kill her too! ,positive
 OK OK I must say I was impressed. It's hard to say what I'm more impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so that I don't gouge my eyes out or the movie itself. Either way Hitch was pretty darn good. Hey it was good enough for me to watch twice. Will Smith was funny and good. Kevin James was just hilarious and absolutely essential for the movie. As much as this movie centered around Hitch (Will Smith) without Kevin James it's just not the same. The story is: Hitch is a match maker that helps the guy woo the girl. His job is to create the chance for the girl to notice the guy when she otherwise wouldn't. After the encounter the rest is all up to the guy to make or break the relationship. He works on referral only and stays largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is Hitch's project this time around and Albert has eyes on Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta) a Paris Hilton type figure. While that plot unfolds Hitch himself has eyes on Sara (Eva Mendes) a sharp independent fanged gossip columnist that wants nothing to do with a relationship. The two stories make for some funny moments and they tie together for a bit of a quagmire. Of course no love story is complete without the obligatory miscommunication misunderstanding or mishap to send the guy chasing after the girl. Fortunately they make it brief and unsappy. Hitch was a fun and funny movie that flowed very well and rolled along without a hitch. ,positive
 I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a kid waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then I grew up Dr. Who went off the air and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I found out there was going to be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it going to live up to the expectations I had carried around since I was little? Would they screw it up? Would the Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck? Would they create a more intimate relationship with the Dr. and his assistant? YES NO NO NO NO!!! This show is wonderful!! I love the new Dr. I love his assistant. I love the show. And I find myself excited on Friday nights now waiting for the new episode. I'm just now seeing 2005 episodes as I live in the States so I'm a little behind the rest of you. I hope the next Dr. is as great as this one! ,positive
 Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier found by a girl from a Confederate boarding school and he's taken in and nursed back to health instead of turned over to Confederate soldiers. Seems that the women-folk at this place have ulterior motives. Geraldine Paige the headmistress justifies not turning him into the Confederacy and even passes him off as her cousin. Of course when the man gets to feeling better he becomes quite the lady's man and is pretty much making the rounds but when he gets busted he REALLY gets busted in fact so badly he gets his leg cut off but it's for his own good of course not out of retribution. Things get carried a bit further though when certain women don't get what they want. I haven't seen this for years and it still has a certain creepiness to it that by today's standards is still pretty strange. Not typical Eastwood at all. If you haven't seen this one it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10. ,positive
 I bought this a while back during a massive martial arts movie phase. Although this certainly ain't the best I do love this kind of film making and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars I always appreciate the fact that whilst he lacked formal martial arts training he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance. He also has a good beard. This movie has him in a good heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies he still acquits himself well. Early appearances from Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also nice too see especially for the fact that Chow Yun Fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play. He may not be a great fighter but he does OK. Eddy Ko is as great a bad guy as ever he performs the same villainry as in many of his other films and does it great as per usual. The fellow who plays Bu is good too I don't recall his name but he's in Magnificent Butcher too. Although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era The postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance. There are some very nifty scenes good characters and a good eclectic mixture of Hong Kong talents all coming together to decent effect. All in all I would recommend this to kung fu and general Hong Kong action fans. It may not be a stylised classic like the Shaw Brothers films or as crowd pleasing as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee but it is rock solid entertainment. ,positive
 Once again we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists' work has been fully restored and we see this old-time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling. Inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy etc. In essence this is a story of those goods coming to life such as the animals on the labels of items or a pie or even a pack of cigarettes. The whole show is narrated by Jack Bunny a Jack Benny impersonator with music from conductor Leopold Stokowski who was in so many Looney Tunes animated shorts I have lost count. A lot of the humor is topical so it pays to know who Little Egypt and other characters. The Busby Berkeley-type aqua number with bathing suited-sardines coming out of the can and the tomato can-can dance were both clever! All of the above and more was in the first half of this slightly longer-than-normal length cartoon. The second half was about a King Kong-type which escapes from the Animal Crackers box and terrorizes everyone. That part was not much and ended on a somewhat stupid note. So..... an A for the first half a D for the second making it about a C-plus or B-minus overall. ,positive
 Out of all the Bat-films Batman Returns is my favorite. This beautiful dark and funny film is one of Tim Burton's best work. Although it is much violent and darker this is the Batman that creator Bob Kane envisioned many years ago. Michael Keaton reprises his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time he's up against two deadly foes Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. With a great cast and film score by Danny Elfman the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman battles the evil forces that are trying to take over Gotham City. Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek a shrewd businessman who has an evil scheme up his sleeve. But of course Michelle Pfeiffer is the one that steals the show. With all of these components you have a film that will blow you away. This is the reason why you go to the movies. It's got everything. It's really a shame that Tim Burton didn't get to direct the other sequels. If so I think the franchise would still be going strong today. Batman Returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies. ,positive
 I'm amazed that of all the reviews I've looked at nobody seems to have noticed one of the main points of this film or at least how I saw it. It seems like one big homosexual fantasy camp clothing a glorified nude Ferdinand a definite sexual tension between Ariel and Prospero and as a final climax a group of men in tight sailor suits dancing the hornpipe. This whole approach once you get used to it provides you with all sorts of fantastic scenes and images. The sight of an innocent Ariel being pulled towards a disgusting nude Sycorax in order to perform her earthy and abhorr'd commands is one of the darkest I've ever scene in a Shakespeare film. However by the end of the film I'd grown tired of the style and the final hornpipe dance was just too much to take. Still overall its an interesting interpretation of the play. ,positive
 These are the kinds of movies I loved and still love growing up. Unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them. This movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy. There was some film student earlier that complained it wasn't A list material. But that is not the point. The point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge CGI Cliché' filled movies. There are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you and not get as much money as they can. Besides its also nice to know that good ol' Bruce isn't dead yet. ,positive
 Cult film-maker Corbucci's rarest of his thirteen Spaghetti Westerns (of which I'm only left with WHAT AM I DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REVOLUTION [1972] to catch) is one I only became aware of fairly recently via Marco Giusti's Stracult guide; it's an atypically bleak genre gem in the style of the director's own masterpiece THE GREAT SILENCE (1968) complete with desolate snowy landscapes. Johnny Hallyday the French Elvis Presley whom I first saw in Jean-Luc Godard's DETECTIVE (1985) is a curious but highly effective choice to play the loner anti-hero Hud (who like Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name from Sergio Leone's celebrated Dollars Trilogy is fitted with a steel-plate armor for protection); incidentally I had 'met' Hallyday's stunning daughter Laura Smet at the 2004 Venice Film Festival but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director Claude Chabrol! Gastone Moschin is another curious addition to the fold (serving pretty much the same function that Frank Wolff did in THE GREAT SILENCE) but acquits himself well and is amusingly clumsy in the presence of a bathing Francoise Fabian; the latter then plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a banker's widow who seduces all and sundry in the pursuit of her goals. Sylvie Fennec has the other major female role as a farm girl looked after by Hallyday and who at one point is entreated into Free Love by 'hippie' Apache Gabriella Tavernese (with this is mind it's worth noting that the movie features surprising but welcome bouts of nudity from both Fabian and Tavernese)! Incidentally the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long-haired youths (who also engage in dope-smoking and revolutionary talk) is a somewhat half-baked attempt at contemporary relevance  but it all eventually adds to the fun (besides even the black barmaid sports an Afro hairdo!). Mario Adorf too enjoys himself tremendously with the smallish role of a larger-than-life Mexican bandit nicknamed El Diablo  who keeps a youthful biographer constantly by his side (an element which may have influenced Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN [1992]) and at one point challenges the captive Moschin to a head-butting duel! Having mentioned this the film also contains one very unusual 'weapon of death'  as Hallyday disposes of an adversary by kicking the cash-register of the saloon into his face! As always the enjoyably fake fistfights are accompanied by over-emphatic sound effects; equally typically for the genre however the wistful score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino emerges a most significant asset. Actually the ambiguous ending is entirely in keeping with the film's generally somber tone  after Fabian's comeuppance at the hands of the locals the hippies (who had previously idolized Hud) suddenly turn against him when wounded and terrorize the town (forcing everyone on the street and unclothed)but the unflappable gunman manages to lift himself up to meet their challenge (they however scurry away at the prospect of facing him!) and then rides out of town leaving Fennec behind. In conclusion I acquired this via a good-quality Widescreen print in Italian albeit with French credits and the occasional lapse  about one minute of screen-time in all  into the French language (where apparently the original soundtrack wasn't available). ,positive
 I have just started watching this show. Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station RTE1 at 12.30pm in the Afternoon (as of 26th July 2006). This program literally makes me laugh out aloud and I cannot boast that on most sitcom's (apart from UK's 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais in it). Todays episode of TKoQ (26 July 2006)was the one where Carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and Doug wants Carrie to have no 'outside' friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his 'belly hair!' and licks plates when he goes out to dinner! But another funny episode was the other week when the old fella (carries Dad) won on the Bingo and that episode creased me up with laughter especially when they went out and got a replacement fridge and Carries father stood there looking at it and thought it was new. So I don't know how much longer this has got to run on Irish TV or at which stage (year recorded) we are at but I hope it don't end soon because I am really enjoying it. To sum up there is some great writing some great characters and comedy acting (namely by Carrie Doug and Carries father) some great punchlines and delivered well - a bit saucy and near the mark sometimes (send the kids out the room!) but i think this US Sitcom is a winner and very funny. ,positive
 Well it might be a kid's movie...perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it! so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm?! it is teenager movie i agree.. so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good.. so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie.Anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story ...i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it...''the truth is never overated''. ,positive
 I find it hard to believe this could happen at all. We do not know if Justin and Richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past. The movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble. So the first crime they commit is murder? Just to play and jostle with the cops? How do they pick up any girl and just say you are it? Also Richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle. Hmmm. This whole concept is really hard to believe. That said let's move on. I found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then. As for Cassie who was a victim of Carl Hudson has a horrible time trying to survive. The memory of having been stabbed 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional mess. Sandra does a superb acting job. She sure made me believe she was one angry cop. As for solving the crime I thought it was great. This movie kept me planted in my chair. Loved the acting of all but Sam. He had no get-up and go. The one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should I say the rape scene. ,positive
 Incredibly hilarious mid-70's Italian Rootsploitation with lots of non-consensual S&M lesbian sex gratuitous racial cruelty etc...Few redeeming cinematic qualities except for the fairly cool theme music with dubby African drums and flute. Brilliant sample dialog: White Slave Owner (to White Plantation Manager): You're so dumb I'll bet you forgot to interrogate that n****r midwife! White Plantation Manager: Not only did I interrogate her I did it so well she died before I could get any answers from her! All the black actors have 70's afros and say yes massa in a high-pitched voice. The female lead has sex with everybody on the plantation. 10 Stars for fans of tasteless sleaze. ,positive
 No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson himself you can't deny that this video is the most unique video of all time. There is no other video that is even remotely close to Thriller The first time I saw it was when I was 6 years old and it scared me bad. Now I watch it with a smile because I can now appreciate the marvel that it is. I love this video and it will be around for as long as music videos exist. I think everyone should sit down and watch it when its on sometime and look back and see how great it was especially for being 1983. ,positive
 Okay. You saw the film and I saw the film. True? If not there are plenty of plot summaries out there and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create another. The most stunning aspect of the film is unquestionably the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads. Their emotional honesty was as compelling if not more so than any performances I've seen in recent months. I found I laughed cried and cringed right along with them and that's saying a great deal because I'm often called a jaded and cynical jerk. As one would expect the story is rife with clichés and I suppose that's the Achilles heel of the picture. It's a story we've all seen many times before; we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce Rory. Though you may not know exact mechanics you know there will be a transformative friendship a bittersweet romance and a gut-wrenching conclusion. If it weren't for the strong cast and directing this film would be nothing more than the soporific swill that comprises eighty percent of the Hallmark Channel's program schedule. ,positive
 ya know the concept of guilty pleasures ? yeah you have 'em like admitting you watched - and enjoyed - goonies battlestar galactica AFTER they reached earth v the series charlie's angels starsky & hutch the 1950s version of superman or godzilla movies. here's the ultimate in guilty pleasures. coupled with jack of all trades in a sam raimi action packed hour this half hour slot is fast paced easy to follow and loaded with fun-to-watch scanlity-clad babes. the man that brought us evil dead xena hercules and the adventures of brisco county jr does it again with this 2000 update of charlies angels. we got charlie (voice) an unknown being that has the knowlege and the time to find people who need help bosley (mouser) the gadget man and three gorgeous babes that kick a** for a living. and oh what a living! ,positive
 This film is a sleeper because Rod Steiger's is the only big name in the credits. Yet all of the supporting actors fit well with his character. It was fitting that in his last film Rod Steiger reminded us once more of his inventive power as an actor. He portrayed a grandfather's impulsiveness stubbornness and acceptance of the end of life in a characteristically individual and convincing performance. Because his character was close to death the story brings us closer to the most precious things granted to us: the privilege of life relationships with family members and the empathy of those who care for us. His search together with his grand daughter for one of his sons provided enough suspense to keep me waiting expecting a highly-charged climax such as the meeting of two long-separated elderly lovers who were also on the cusp of death in Forever Young. I wondered how the meeting would be staged and how tightly my emotions would be wound by the time he and his granddaughter reached the end of his quest. I was delighted to find that the story brought more than I expected. The delightfully satisfying climax brought for me a greater appreciation of the value of the precious gifts of life love and family that are enjoyed today by me and by all of us. ,positive
 Emilio is a successful business man a perfect father and a good husband. Or that is what everybody think. The perfect storyline he has carefully built all along these years will start closing around him all of a sudden. Will he be able to keep up with his own lies? This is a very well laid out drama with great acting and steady direction. Even though the plot is pushed up to the limit to increase the tension the movie explores some of our worst fears... Do we really know the people we deal with? Can we be so sure? The story develops at an increasingly faster pace as it reaches the point where Emilio is not in control of his lies anymore. A good deal of Spanish movies have interesting stories but are far from technical proficiency. The perfect rhythm and well shot scenes make the actors so credible we get inside Emilio and hate him and suffer for him as his situation gets more and more desperate. There is no need for any Spanish folklore nor is this an attempt to create a Hollywood style flick. This is real Spain 2002 and regardless the obvious unlikeliness of Emilio's life existing in reality there are good chances somebody we know is not quite like the person he claims to be. Not just a great commercial product it will let you wondering where lies can get us to. Can we keep up? Well done. ,positive
 This was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention through to the very end. Maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject matter and that's why it's being trashing so much. It could also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the American Pie series higher ratings. Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst not an agent who is to observe an interrogation of an Egyptian man by Moroccans not Egyptians. He's not supposed to be a hardened agent and so comes off as naive of the interrogation techniques used. This is more believable than if he were to come across as being an old hat at it. The story jumps around a bit and can be confusing but it also makes you stay focused on whats going on until the end when everything comes together as the puzzle falls into place. The supporting actors did a good job of helping to carry the movie. I found the movie to be powerful and thought provoking. ,positive
 As listed and stated in many previous comments this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit. Indeed more than 20 years after it was originally transmitted it is still watched and watched again and has a huge global fan-following something which must indicate that the makers of this series undeniably got something right. The root of the series' brilliance and remarkable appeal has however got to be that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters  all of which are brought to life by marvellous actors. The characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity. In contrast to many other Robin Hood adaptations and indeed many other film and TV-productions in general the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have apparent flaws while the baddies although put forward as evil and ruthless frequently can be understood and even on occasion seem quite sympathetic. This very much makes Robin of Sherwood into a story about multifaceted REAL people  rather than of good and bad people  something which very much adds to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. Also although very much being an action-packed series featuring numerous amazing stunts (which are remarkable in themselves seeing as this was made long before today's computer animation green screens and so forth. Thus behind every one of those endless guys falling off castle walls horses and catching fire there actually is a real person who at some point DID fall off a castle wall or a horse or catch fire) there is always amazing dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode. In the final analysis however it is generally the series' baddies  Nickolas Grace as The Sheriff of Nottingham Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne and Philip Jackson as The Abbot Hugo de Rainault  who get the very best lines and who more than often steal the show with their arguments full of wit and cant. It's a wedding not a celebration! is just one of their many timeless pearls of wisdom which seems to follow one through life :-). 20 years after the fact it is indeed hard to believe that Robin of Sherwood was originally something made for television  and apparently not with a great deal of money  in order to provide fleeting Saturday afternoon amusement for small children in Great Britain. Filmed in beautiful locations with clever amazing scripts and featuring remarkable stunts and fantastic actors  many of whom give the performance of their lives in this show  this in numerous ways seems to be more professionally made and have more production value than many a Hollywood film. ,positive
 If you read the book by Carl Hiaasen the movie follows pretty much true to form with a few minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion this is a great family movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko)pretty well steals the show from an all-star cast that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The kids in the movie do a great job led by Logan Lerman Brie Larson and Cody Linley. Brie Larson is maybe a little too petite to play Beatrice. I pictured a bigger girl maybe 6 foot 175 lbs in the role of Beatrice. This might have made her more believable in her role of beating up Dana. They should have developed her tough girl character more and had her bite through a tire or kick a soccer ball through a person. She is very pretty and I understand why she was cast she is a box office attraction. This is about as PG as a movie gets these days no sex and very little violence. This movie is a parents'dream come true a movie with a strong environmental message with kids that have deep appreciation for the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults have fallen short in the stewardship of our planet and that our children can demand better. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Mullet Fingers says Florida could use some mountains like Montana. Florida is so flat there is nothing to stop developers from clearing it coast to coast . Also the photography of Florida wildlife spoke volumes without dialog. As a family movie with kids ages 5-15 this is a great movie! As a bonus parents' will be entertained especially if they're parrotheads . ,positive
 This is another classic Seagal movie. He walks no cruises through the patriot just all the other Mega Seagal movies. Nothing even comes close to challenging Seagal in this movie except maybe the part where he has to find a cure for this so called 'plague' and he starts throwing things about the lab but it all works out i mean lets face it its Master Seagal he's got to win. What about his outfit in the film masterpiece he must have picked it himself. Its great that everyone in the film is dying after being exposed to the virus but Seagal doesn't even get a cough. The incident at the end when he kills the fat guy with the broken glass genius i bet Seagal thought of that one as well. This film is class pure and simple. great plot great characters and Seagal. ,positive
 Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting! For the people who say they don't make shoot em ups like they use to. Well this one is really hard-core! David Bradley is really good and his character takes a pounding in the movie. He gets hit by the stick over a dozen times gets stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again gets beat up recovers and is ready for more action! His character is incredibly tuff! Charles Napier was very good as well and he arguably steals the show! Vernen Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka had a short and an uncredited role in Hard Justice! As for the action it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the huge stand off like scene in the beginning has cars getting blown up and flipping up in mid air! There is so much that happens in the 95 minute run time. For the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and fighting that this film has to offer! Hard Justice is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper an d plus the box is cool! There is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed! Look and see if you can find some good deals on Ebay Half.com Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! I strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot ems and fighting movies and has been disappointed by other movies that have the look like a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get Hard Justice! ,positive
 I regard this loving and sensitively written story to be one of the screen's true masterpieces. After having seen this film originally on the silver screen with my mother in Los Angeles California when it first came out many years passed before I would have the opportunity to experience it again. The beauty quiet simplistic elegance and tranquility of the film to me set it aside from many many others of its kind. Yes tears still come to my eyes when I see it and hear the refrain of that once in a lifetime song. perhaps still today my number one all-time most beloved film. I would hope this classic love story will be enjoyed and appreciated by our future generations. ,positive
 This is one of the great ones. It works so beautifully that you hardly notice the miscasting of then 37 year old Dana Andrews as the drugstore soda jerk who goes to war and comes back four years later when he would have been at most 25. But then who else should have played him? ,positive
 What can I say about this film that won't give you any preconceived notions when you see it? Very little. The plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down. What follows after that is the movie. It is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years. Everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended. It is not a perfect film. The film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story even more confused.(If you've read any number of other comments here on IMDb and elsewhere you'll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on) I'm not sure what I actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have. If you like horror and don't mind not having everything clearly summed up I suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl. ,positive
 Love is a Many-Splendored Thing is set in Hong Kong in 1949-50 and tells the story of the relationship between Mark Elliott a white American journalist and Han Suyin a half-Chinese half-European doctor. This story of a mixed-race love affair was quite a daring theme for the fifties and as it often did Hollywood tried to soften the blow by casting a white actress as the supposedly non-Caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man something that would be regarded as politically incorrect today but was quite acceptable then.. (Think for example of the casting of Ava Gardner in Show Boat or Natalie Wood in West Side Story ) The setting of the story in a British colony was also perhaps a way of exploring racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in America. Suyin loses her job in a Hong Kong hospital because her British superiors take exception to the fact that she is dating a white man whom she is unable to marry because his estranged wife will not grant him a divorce. As was sometimes the case European colonialism was made the whipping-boy for some of America's own failings. Imagine the furore that would have been unleashed had a similar film been made about a black or mixed-race woman doctor in a hospital in Alabama. Besides racial issues the film also raises questions of international politics referring to both the Communist seizure of power in China and the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and a well-known author of the period; in reality she tended to support Mao's Communist regime but here she is shown as firmly anti-Communist. This is not however primarily an issue movie about either racialism or politics but rather a romance a good example of what would have been known at the time as a woman's picture . Such films although mostly made by male directors were mostly aimed at female audiences. They dealt with love and romance- often unhappy romance- from the woman's point of view and had a strong female character in the leading role. The genre often provided roles for actresses older than the heroines of standard romances. Earlier examples were normally in monochrome but by the fifties they generally as here used lush sumptuous colour. Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would have been more convincing in the role Jennifer Jones does a very good job as Suyin. I found William Holden as Mark rather uncharismatic but this does not matter much as Suyin is very much the dominant figure. She is screen much more than Mark and the film examines her family and professional life much more than it does his. Although Jennifer was still strikingly beautiful she was in her mid-thirties rather older than most romantic heroines of films of this period. Holden was about the same age unusually for the fifties when boy-meets-girl often meant older man meets girl . The film is not particularly profound but is well-made with some attractive photography particularly of Hong Kong itself reflecting the growing trend in the fifties for shooting on location rather than on studio sets. Seldom can Hong Kong have looked so beautiful; the view from a hill overlooking the city takes on a special meaning as this is where Suyin and Mark go for their romantic assignments. The overall mood is one of poignant doomed romance a mood heightened by the atmospheric photography and the musical score including one of the most memorable movie themes ever written. 7/10 ,positive
 I finally managed to get myself a copy of Dario Argento's Opera and I tell you ... that was about time !! It was the last Argento movie I had yet to see and I'm a fan of most of his work. I reckon that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint ( like Phenomena ). But the plot idea of Opera always appealed to me and it turns out I was right !! I enjoyed every shot in Opera and I was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last. Out of all the Argento movies Opera went straight to the number one spot and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well. The script and plot-idea of Opera is rather simple. Especially compared to Argento's previous movie Phenomena that had too many ideas in it and ended up being a mess. The plot of Opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time it's an excellent satiric comment - almost a spoof - towards the opponents of explicit violence. ***SPOILERS*** A young opera singer ( the gorgeous Cristina Marsillach ) is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer. During every massacre he commits he forces Betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open. There are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them they're getting torn apart. ***END SPOILERS***. To this simple - yet effective - idea Argento adds a lot of horrific elements like ravens the classic piece ( and curse ) of MacBeth and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music. Especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value. Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them and Dario Argento knows it as well. The violence and gore is very well presented in Opera and that's what makes this a true Argento picture. His best in my opinion with Profondo Rosso as a close second. I surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you. Especially for fans of the ( Italian ) horror business this is an absolute must ! Favorite Rewind -scene : Argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where Betty's friend is getting shot in the eye while she's trying to see who's in front of the door. ,positive
 I caught this one on cable and I was very surprised. Steady direction and some good performances accent a twisty and very engaging story. This one will keep you up all night thinking about what was real and what wasn't. Check out Jason Scott Lee in the Lou Diamond Phillips role! ,positive
 This film is all about humans. This film stayed as my all time favorite short cartoon for years. Isn't it the simplest things that make life so much more interesting?! We humans are so soft compassionate funny caring to each other one moment -- we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with the least effort the next. In our short lives we destroy our world each other and often our own lives than spend the rest of our lives trying to fix what we've destroyed. Sometimes there is nothing left to fix! This film can entertain educate and even help us realize what is wrong in our lives! Life is short and can be even shorter! The ending is way too optimistic I am afraid. I love Richard Condie's mind and what he makes happen with it! Enjoy H.K. ,positive
 I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston Texas. I really enjoyed this movie and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This movie was directed by Jacques Tourneur and besides Jean Peters in the starring role. It also stars Louis Jourdan Debra Paget and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. She also starred in Viva Zapata with Marlon Brando Anthony Quinn who won an Oscar for playing the role Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando starred as Zapata) (1952). And she also starred in Captain from Castile (1947) with Tyron Power. Since then I've been trying to find a place where it is available but so far I have not been successful. Does anybody have any suggestions about where I can find and purchase this movie? It this comment contains spoilers I am unaware of it. ,positive
 Oh my goodness. I would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than Domestic Disturbance this soon but here it is. Armed with rotten plot terrible editing stilted acting and headache-inducing 'style' (sorry I have no other words for it) Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re-evaluate an entire genre; that is this film is so bad that even the thrillers I condemned as complete failures now seem a little better. Now not only Sanctimony is a terrible film in itself it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it. Right from the main titles -- nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from Se7en -- I was under the impression that something didn't smell quite right. As soon as the movie started with a series of corny wanna-be hip quick-cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors I knew where that smell was coming from. It turns out that two policemen or rather policeman Jim Renart (Michael Paré) and policewoman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin) are investigating on a murder spree in Vancouver. A serial killer known as Monkey Killer (what a menacing chilling nickname uh?) for his working methods has killed quite a lot of people. You see this nut apparently works following the proverb see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and cuts eyes ears and tongues out of his victims. So far six eyes six ears and three tongues. In very ingenious fashion Renart and Smith figure out that the Monkey Killer is probably going to kill other three people... well because he probably wants to complete the number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien) a young successful good-looking businessman with a dreadful temper. And that's where the rip-off of American Psycho kicks in. So we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath none of which is interesting in the least until they finally meet. Along the way to that a disco where Renart barely misses Gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory: Renart goes in the back of the disco club because... well just because the script tells us it's a suspect place; then with one single punch in the stomach Renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path and the guard is never heard of again? Does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic? Anyway after another murder Gerrick turns in as a witness but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he might be the killer. In typical Basic Instinct fashion Smith gets some dates with the young businessman under the assumption that she might discover his true identity. I won't spoil the ending but it is quite simply an embarrassment; there are contradictions some plot holes issues that never get resolved and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder supposed to be shocking and sad comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that I frankly can't imagine how anyone could not laugh at it. At 87 minutes Sanctimony is really pushing it. You never care about one single character because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them. You are never pulled into the story because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place. The acting ranges from average (Van Dien) to downright atrocious (Rubin and most of the supporting cast); the music is abysmal generic techno and the photography is one of the worst I have ever seen. Of course like every fiasco of the genre we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity. 3/10 ,negative
 If I'm to like a movie I need to care about the lead characters and what happens to them. In this waste-pod of a film I found myself hoping that they would all die in the end. None of the characters are people that you'd ever want to meet they all made me sick. If not for a few nude scenes I would have given this wretched movie a 1. ,negative
 Another film to punish us for the crime of enjoying Pulp Fiction. If you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half this'll probably fit the bill. Fans of the debut episode of Aeon Flux wherein the title character slays literally thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers single-handedly will really go for it. Otherwise it's not exactly a clever movie. In fact all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people. Sometimes an entire scene goes by and the only thing that happens is you guessed it! someone gets shot. Or to spice things up twenty people get shot. First they're just sitting there the next minute they're sitting there dead. Yahoo! Rough plot: A young American goes to Paris (An American in Paris get it?) hires a prostitute (the ethereal Julie Delpy) gets in touch with some old French buddies one of which has AIDS they plan and attempt a bank heist. Of course movie convention states that no bank robberies on film go off w/o a hitch and this hitch takes up about three-quarters of the running time (it's like Dog Day Afternoon without the Sidney Lumet's wit patience or humanity). While at the bank things go wrong (surprise!) and the Parisian with AIDS goes wacko with his Uzi several HUNDRED times. No spoilers here but suffice to say that you're at such an emotional distance from these characters that it's not likely you'll care who lives and who dies by the end of the film. Some have called it stylish. Perhaps it is but it's someone else's style it's a movie that's already been done and Killing Zoe is trapped by convention. Nowhere in the course of the movie does the director (Roger Avary co-winner of the Pulp Fiction screenplay Oscar) do anything really original stylish funky or outrageous. Unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count there isn't anything else to set this one apart from the multitude. ,negative
 I thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series. After all part 3 didn't measure up to part 2 and this one doesn't have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3 but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching. The girl's part was pretty good. She's a lost teenager who needs direction. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi a man she just met. Of course he was a friend of her brother. I did appreciate the monastery. One might think from some of my other reviews that I wouldn't have liked the dancing monks but I thought it was amusing. It showed that they know how to have some fun. Now if these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop-music that would have been another matter. Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug. Miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid nations trying to destroy each other is stupid but having respect for all life is not stupid. Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well. I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Sure there were some things I liked about it. It wasn't as funny as part three and no character could ever live up to Sato in part 2. This movie has no re-watch value. I can't imagine watching it again but it is worth seeing once. ,negative
 Heart of Darkness Movie Review Could a book that is well known for its eloquent wording and complicated concepts ever be made into a movie good enough to portray the deep meaning in the book? So far that goal hasn't been achieved. The Heart of Darkness was attempted to be made into a movie in 1993 but it was a failure in comparison to the book. It is hard enough to make any book into a movie. There always is the worry that it won't be as descriptive or have the same meaning. So why the novel The Heart of Darkness is made into a movie I am clueless. There is so much description and hidden meaning throughout the entire book. When just reading the words plainly I think that a person would think it is pretty boring and wouldn't get the symbolism. I think that is what happened in the movie; the movie just skimmed the story at the surface. The movie didn't even follow the full storyline of the book major changes were made that I thought made the movie worse. For example the manager did not go along on the boat with Marlow and the rest of the crew the spy did instead. I think that took out some major plots and took out the great deception of the manager in relation to Kurtz. Also Kurtz wasn't even on the steamboat when he died which especially made the entire journey even more futile which just got annoying after a while. And when Marlow was telling Kurtz's fiancée about his final moments and words it was no where near as descriptive or important the fiancée didn't even get that upset. As far as the acting went none of the actors did a very good job except for the actor that played Mfumu. In my opinion Kurtz was not very evil and that was kind of an important thing in the book. Also other characters such as Marlow the manager and the fiancé didn't do the characters justice that they deserved from the book. Their acting wasn't very exciting or memorable at all. Over all I don't think that this book should have even been attempted to be made into a movie. I think it is fine to use some of the themes in a different story line like in Apocalypse Now. But as for following the same exact story line of the book it just does it shame. ,negative
 Yeah it may not be for adults and some adults may find it stupid but if you don't think about it it's really not that bad. The story has Alvin and his gang going across the world in search of jewels for a bad person and the misadventures that they come in contact with. So the animation is good and the story is cute and the songs are forgettable but it's a good movie. I give it a 6 out of 10 or *** out of 4 stars. ,negative
 God I never felt so insulted in my whole life than with this crap. There are so many ways to describe this piece of crap that I think that if I said everything that came to mind I would get banned by this site. How do I begin? Well for one it doesn't take knowledge of the original series to know that this movie is a slap to the face of people who've seen it. The biggest butchering of a theme song ever made is here from a metal version to a freaking RAP VERSION what were they thinking? How does Underdog and a electronic-heavy musical style match? The story is so basic that I will do something I don't usually do and not even give a summary. Just think this: A dog gets superpowers fill in the rest. That's how predictable this movie is. And then comes the jokes....please kill me now. This style of humor that might not even get the kids laughing it's that bad well expect that punch line after the sneezing. That was slightly funny. But what surprises me the most is why Jason Lee(Ny Name Is Earl) Patrick Warburton(Emperor's New Groove) and Jim Belushi(According to Jim) are all here. In the shows/movies I mentioned the actors in my opinion do a good job and excluding Lee are the best actors in this movie but that says very little. The rest deserve Golden Rasberry nominations for this crap. I am very sad to see such good actors buried by this disaster. All in all this is just as bad as Doogal which I reviewed as well and again my head would explode if I saw anything worse than this. ,negative
 I believe that this was supposed to be shocking or something.... All that I can say is....POOR GOAT!!! This flick is so poorly done that the parts that should shock and revolt you come across as laughable at best. The characters are so lame and 2....wait....1 dimensional that I applauded each sick death.....all except that POOR GOAT. ,negative
 i was disappointed in this documentary.i thought it would be about the second chess match between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue the supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human chess player.Kasparov was and still is considered the greatest chess player ever.the movie takes us back to 1997 where Kasporov had agreed to have a rematch with deep Blue after defeating it 1 year earlier.but instead of focusing on the game it focuses more on what happens before and after.there are snippets of the game but not very many.much of the film centers around Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly.the movie also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any way.they even chat with the manager of the building where the match took place.who cares?i also found it very dry and slow.ultimately this movie was unsatisfying.this is just my opinion of course.if you like conspiracy theories this movie might interest you.for people not into chess or conspiracy theories this movie would probably have no value.i am a chess fan and i only stuck it out because of that.i give Game Over:Kasparov and the Machine 4/10 ,negative
 No one can say I wasn't warned as I have read the reviews (both user & external) but like most of us attracted to horror movies... curiosity got this cat. (Come on we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room but you know that's horror aficionados are always dying to know what's in there even if we know it'll be bad). The bottom line is that this movie left me angry. Not because it pretends to be real (who cares...gimmicks are allowed) or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) or even because the movie is so bad (and I am being polite here). What really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of BWP but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that. I don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo BWP then kudos to them but they didn't even try. The movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie! ,negative
 Remember those old kung fu movies we used to watch on Friday and Saturday late nights when our babysitters THOUGHT we were in charge? Well this movie plays exactly like one of those movies. Patsy Kensit's biggest claim to fame was the love interest to Mel Gibson's character in Lethal Weapon 2 and this performance was one of the reasons why she's never made it big: she's a terrible actress. In Lethal Weapon 2 I thought she was cute. Cute enough to check out some of the other movies she'd been in including Loves Music Loves to Dance another big let down which I obviously was not impressed with either. But as attractive as she is to my eyes my soul screamed at me to turn it off because she played another cheap predictable role and done it very badly. In this movie Kensit stars as a comedienne (and not a good one either) who's working the clubs of France (couldn't cut it in her own homeland so she's making THEIR ears bleed) who's down on her luck but even worse the French government wants to throw her out because of an expired visa (or maybe they just caught her act). But she gets married to this Casanova (Freiss) who is just as down on his luck and the predictability begins...terribly! Is there any way to give this movie a NEGATIVE rating? 1 out of 10 stars is over rating it! ,negative
 If this film won the Lumiere Award for Best French-Language Film then what kind of garbage is coming out of France these days?? The subject matter is an important one -- how the African economies are kept as economic hostages by the international organizations that are supposed to be helping them namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of the governmental budgets of several African nations go to payment of Western debt while their people suffer from disease dehydration and illiteracy. ... but the subject matter was treated in the most dry manner that could be conceived by man -- dryer than the Sahara that surrounds the country of Mali in which this film takes place. More monotone and action-lacking than any documentary I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre) one witness after another comes forward in this trial that is captured on film that condemns the World Bank & IMF. Some critics may site the colorful visual asides within the film but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. They belonged better in a coffee table book than in this film. Even the characters in the film say something like This trial is boring and When will it be over? Everyone in the theater laughed. Were those people on the screen reading our minds?? Danny Glover had a brief appearance in this film. It is a televised movie within Bamako and it was set within Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti-Western I've ever tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was where a Caucasian bad guy accidentally shoots an African woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse whatsoever. Perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it is unintentionally killing Africans. And one last technical parting shot the subtitles were difficult to read with so much light colors on the screen and not enough black outline to the subtitles themselves. I've already summarized the movie for you. Don't be fooled by the hype. No need to see this film. You'll never get these two hours back in your life. ,negative
 Ben (Rupert Grint) is a deeply unhappy adolescent the son of his unhappily married parents. His father (Nicholas Farrell) is a vicar and his mother (Laura Linney) is ... well let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus' army. It's only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul-mouthed eccentric once-famous and now-forgotten actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters) that he finally finds himself in true 'Harold and Maude' fashion. Of course Evie is deeply unhappy herself and it's only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness. Of course it's corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it too and Walters who could sleep-walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted is excellent. It's when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character (like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink) that she's at her best. The problem is she's the only interesting character in the film (and it's not because of the script which doesn't do anybody any favours). Grint on the other hand isn't just unhappy; he's a bit of a bore as well while Linney's starched bitch is completely one-dimensional. (Still she's got the English accent off pat). The best that can be said for it is that it's mildly enjoyable - with the emphasis on the mildly. ,negative
 I watched this because of the description and cover art and yet again was deceived.I am getting sick of all these new stupid straight to DVD horror movies.Once in a blue moon 1 will be OK. It started out with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple one night during a thunderstorm which was OK because I like storms and it set a nice mood.Then it turned into a cool road trip where they ended up at a diner encountering bizarre people.The rest got weird and then got confusing.I did watch it til the end but was even more confused when it ended so badly.I had higher hopes for this movie but it was more like a science fiction then horror and something that should have been made for TV. ,negative
 I happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie that was humorous however my expectations were let down. This movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a PG-13 movie this should have been rated R for the many mature references that went on in this movie. I wouldn't recommend allowing a 13 year old teen see this. Even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie beware of a truly stupid movie there's no humor in the movie just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of pedophilia something that shouldn't even be joked about. I would like to know what happened to PG-13 movies that were actually safe for actual a 13 year old? This is beyond a deplorable movie and should be re-rated. ,negative
 I watched the first episode of The War at Home because I thought it was worth replacing Arrested Development boy was I disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly ripped-off of Grounded for Life Titus and Married...with Children since they are all similar in plot and overall mood. The so called punch lines are all repetitious and formulaic even more those punch lines aren't even funny at all to me they're more along the lines as being crass and crude. The main character Dave Gold acts like a white trash thug who thinks he's being funny and cool which he's not. (Even Hillary (Dave's daughter) said so in the episode Gaza Strip ). In the episode Dream Crusher Hillary wanted to be a singer {but was actually pretty bad} Dave and Vicky then gladly decided to crush her dreams by telling her she sucked. After that she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned on going to Harvard after telling Dave and Vicky so and left the room the two of them began mindlessly mocking her. Also in the first episode Dave said of Hillary's {black} boyfriend Does she actually think we're gonna let her go out with this guy? I'd rather drink my own urine that line has to the dumbest line in the history of television. And Dave is constantly making fun of Larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a geek. Also let's not forget that he also made fun of Larry's (fat) girlfriend. Dave is the father he's supposed to stand up for his son no matter what. The War at Home is without a doubt the worst TV show for family. That clearly explains why the show should be canceled since it spreads a racism and homophobic agenda. It's like the show wants to be funny for always putting in that stupid laugh track every time someone says something but the lines are all somewhat forced idiotic and pathetically juvenile. Another reason why the show's horrible is the acting Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible terrible actors. Rappaport has to always move his hands around when he's in front of the camera he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with Boston Public . Sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts (he also did this in Malcolm in the Middle }. So to wrap this whole thing up you all got your reasons of what's wrong with this show 1.It's unoriginal 2.The acting sucks 3.It's not even funny 4.All the jokes are the same 5.Has lousy script 6.The characters are pitiful and unlikable 7.The dad's a rip-off of Archie Bunker FOX needs to take this trash off the air because anything's better than this. ,negative
 This was truly horrible. Bad acting bad writing bad effects bad scripting bad camera shots bad filming bad characters bad music bad editing bad casting bad storyline bad ... well you get the idea. It was just just ... what's the word? Oh yeah ... BAD! ,negative
 Did you ever think like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends: Wow this is so cool! We have got to make a splatter horror movie ourselves some day soon. I bet it isn't as difficult as it seems ? Well this must have been what went through the minds of the young Campbell brothers back in 2003 presumably right after watching Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead or a similar independent horror classic. This Demon Summer however is so bad it's embarrassing! These young amateurish filmmakers obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics but that nearly doesn't make them talented. I've seen quite a lot lousy B-movies in my years as a horror fanatic but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made. And it's quite sad to be this open-hearted because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions. There's pretty much no script at all. A duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and whilst reading some passages of it one of them mutates into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenager-groups: dorks hot Catholic girls stoners and troublemakers. That's about it except of course for all the obligatory clichés like the hot girl falling for the biggest dork etc etc... The performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! They just stand there motionless until the script says it's their turn to interact. I hate that! Some of make-up effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punk-songs ever. This film should never have been released... I can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production but it's utterly imbecile and doesn't feature the slightest redeeming element. Not even a bit of amateur-nudity damned! ,negative
 This was one of the worst movies that I have ever watched. The story was about a woman prisoner sent into space to try and save mankind but what it actually turned out to be was that the prisoner was actually put on board a space ship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander. All the story was about was having sex over and over again. There was no need for all of this footage - only to create a soft porn film. Of course we had to see the heroin of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes. I don't know what all this had to do with the actual plot of the movie -except I assume to get men to watch it. I gave it 1 out of 10 only because there was no other rating lower. Don't waste your money or time- it has nothing to do with science fiction but rather a movie for young adolescent boys to watch to see t&a. The creature was shown only more than half way through the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with Signorney Weaver. Poor excuse for entertainment. ,negative
 OK I wanted to see this because it had a few good reviews but this movie was awful... Just plain awful. The characters were 1 dimensional and nothing the actors could do could ever breathe any life into them. The story was abysmal... The wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway through... It just completely becomes forgotten. The visuals while were cool were sooooo drawn out... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the ground 3 minutes of a girl putting on her makeup. I don't know what this guy is trying to pull off... it's like he had no plot no dialog and the movie needed to run just so long so lets not edit scenes at all... Foreign films are great for creating a story without using a lot of dialog this movie makes me think that there is no way American cinema can ever do this. I want to give up watching movies altogether... Bad Bad Movie! ,negative
 This show can most accurately be described as TV Bubble-Gum: It's chewing it has a good taste to it and it lasts a long time. But like Bubble-Gum it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chews. This show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games like Hangman guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list. Callers are the contestants and anybody can play. The questions though are terribly easy. There's some techno music pumped into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop. It never seems to get old but it never adds much to the show anyway. The hostess however regardless of which one that it is extremely personable pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions. I rather enjoy that British woman. But there's nothing to this show. It's simplistic and uncompelling although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on. ,negative
 I'd never heard of zero budget auteur Neil Johnson before seeing Battlespace on DVD at Hollywood Video. A few minutes into the movie I realize this isn't a bad thing. Like many straight to video Sci-Fi movies this is a film dominated largely by overused bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci-fi concepts that fail to create a story. Viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main character's daughter. To me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with militantly ugly visuals and zero character emphasis. Some people on here seem all too ready to take this film seriously and swallowed it's seemingly new age messages hook line and sinker. These favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can delude themselves into thinking that things like Battlefield Earth was a brilliant movie or that Shasta is just as good as Coke. Those who were lured in by the cheesy cover art can look forward to lousy acting (in small doses spaced with long blocks of people not talking) rotten computer animated effects (in extra large doses) and irritating talking computers. What you won't get is excitement emotional stimulation memorable dialogue or a good story. Battlespace is impenetrable bull and the constant irritant of the narration proves it. Real science fiction hell real film-making is about characters and their dialogue not special effects and dull predictions. This is right down there with similar direct to video sci-fi like Cl.One and Recon 2022 . If the boredom of Strange Horizons and Alien Visitor is something you seek out by all means watch the crap out of this. If you enjoy good storytelling and hate fake lens flares you're better off with a real movie. ,negative
 Unfortunately this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels. Universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s which were pale imitations of the original. The intelligent Egyptologist Imhotep has been replaced by a leg-dragging Frankenstein in mummy wrappings who exhibits no signs of intelligent life. This film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen The Mummy (1932) you will be disappointed. ,negative
 First I am a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion both of these movies created and defined the Si-Fi Horror Genre as we know it today. I noticed Lifeforce was often compared to the Aliens saga - after viewing this movie I would highly disagree. There are some okay special effects with the alien vampires and the story line might have been acceptable. I just can't get past a naked woman space vampire throughout the whole movie this is absolutely absurd (although she does look good). Add in a bunch of bad British acting and it's pretty much OVER. Most of the movie ends up taking place in London or somewhere in England so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace setting and any hope of some real Si-Fi Horror action and suspense. ,negative
 I normally don't try and second guess a crime thriller but Cleaner was just entirely too predictable. Samuel L. Jackson playing the character Tom Cutler along with his profession created an interesting twist in the beginning of the film however that was about it. Without even thinking I knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes I had already figured out who the killer was. Rather then trusting myself and having seen several films that make a turnabout I watched to its completion. What a disappointment I was right from the beginning. The casting of characters was a good as well as the acting from Jackson and Harris...except for Eva Mendes. From the starting gate she didn't play a believable character in correlation to the script and this ruined the entire plot too soon. Maybe this was a directing mishap or just weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut should have shown more emotion and distress for the situation that was building around her. This would've made the build-up a bit more compelling and the ending more dramatic. Nevertheless Cleaner is watchable not memorable. I've seen episodes of CSI that were more thrilling then this. ,negative
 This movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that Perrugorria have done. It looks like a commercial from beginning to end. The ¨director¨spent the whole time on a tripod it doesn't have pace rhythm. It's illogical. what a mess. You can tell what's gonna happen since the first 15 minutes and the ending...Wow ------spoiler------- Jesus Christ how the hell Perrugorria got shot? Are you serious? Worst scene of someone getting shot ever! ------end of spoiler----- Bad directing bad script bad acting...Really bad overall. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. It's a waste of money and time. ,negative
 There are films that are not released in theaters but on video. This one should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stock does. No story inept violence over acted badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film. And I did like and enjoyed some of Siegel's other movies. ,negative
 When this series aired I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of The Fugitive and The Incredible Hulk where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. Problem is: They cancelled it before it had a chance to end. (either that or I missed the last episodes). They never got a chance to wrap up the story either knowing it had been cancelled. Poof it was just gone. However like I said before I might have missed the last episodes. But my proof to the contrary is this: I rented the tape. Where I left off in the series. The lead character's wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving King's famous organization the Shop. While getting away hero is kidnapped. It ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the Shop. The end. Last episode. On the video: His wife does not die but escapes the fire with him. Right when he should get nabbed by the Shop he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence. Abrupt silly and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was. They might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations. Almost Pythonesque. The show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the David Bowie song of the same name ,negative
 Like a lot of movies involving little kids this starts off real cute and likable...and then after about a half hour or so becomes the reverse. That's certainly the case here in this time-travel story (which I usually love) where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight! Great premise and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis but..... The kid Rusty is a smart-aleck and whiny brat and Willis Rusty grown up now as Russell gets abrasive with his constant yelling. That is entertainment? No thanks. Young Breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor being involved in a number of films including The Cat In The Hat opposite a more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. Overall a disappointing film especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released. ,negative
 I really like Salman Kahn so I was really disappointed when I seen this movie. It didn't have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. Salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad it was quite nice. Usually Indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an Indian film. The American actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series Heroes Ali Larter. Her acting had a lot to be desired. However she did look good in the Indian dresses that she wore. All the movie had not a lot to be desired and I hope Salman does a lot better on his next movie. Thank you. ,negative
 This movie didn't do it for me an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz' portrayal was OK but there was something so off-putting about the movie itself. The facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it so that would explain a lot. He was never on SNL nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first see her on SNL walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels the logo on the wall is circa 1988-1989 not 1975. And let's talk about the cast -- who are these people?? I have never heard of a one of them. Truly dissatisfying. This movie shows why TV movies are just that TV movies. ,negative
 All I ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better. All the while watching I was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future and there wasn't. I'll admit to not finishing the film I had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man Adam that it was ok to be a whore and get and I quote More tail than any man in the past time. I know not finishing it is a bad review on myself but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested and they failed. This film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. Instead it exemplifies what America ran by lesbian natzis would be like and I'm not against lesbians. Thank you Mr. Director! Someone please give me a redeeming quality... wait I have it! There's no sequel! ,negative
 This movie was disappointing. After 15 years when it was brought back to mind from reviewing some info about Mariel Hemingway all the regrets I felt about the movie came rolling back. While I remember Peter O'Toole I was entirely oblivious to the fact that the female lead (okay - she was little more than an object for discussion in the storyline) was Ms. Hemingway. I saw this movie back in the days when I wrote movie reviews and warned people off it as the stories just didn't work and fifteen years of my subconscious trying to sort things out still hasn't made sense of the flow of the ideas. Part of this may have to do with the fact that it looked like after the original movie (whatever it was about) was filmed an editor came in and tried to piece together something out of it. I don't know if this had been a project of a previous studio boss and so was sabotaged to discredit him or her by the successor or this was a disaster from the original screenplay that attempts to salvage were unsuccessful. The theatrical version just didn't work. ,negative
 I always try not to be harsh while criticizing something that I didn't like but after watching this mini-series I was so disappointed that could not help my irritation. On the one hand it is true that series stayed faithful to the novel and of course I found that very nice but on the other hand terrible casting poor acting especially of key characters  like Funny Price impression of stage play I mean theatrical way of acting makes you irritate from the beginning to the end. I am sure with this budget even if it was low could have been done something much better and worthwhile. it is up to you to watch this series but personally i don't advice you to spend your time on this disappointing ecranization. ,negative
 Like the other guy said It sux you can count the words that have been said in that entire movie on one of your hands Too nudity she got naked like 7 or 8 times in a 1 and a half well past the nudity you'll find a porno behind that film He f**ked her all movie long bad acting bad story bad language Carmen was swearing all movie long so you get out of that movie pornografic scenes and dirty language A lot of gaps in the movie a big silence every now and then The only good thing in that movie is the beautiful places were it has been shot otherwise it's an hour and a half of your life that you'll gonna waste so if u gonna watch that movie Good luck It really Sux ,negative
 Most of this film was okay for a sequel of a sequel of a sequel... I was impressed by the amount of suspense there was; I HAD actually expecting that to be chucked out the window in favor of gore gore gore. It wasn't but there's some pretty ridiculous deaths. The thing that I disliked however was all of the plot complications. Those could have been okay if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain all of them through. But what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution specifically? Why were they protected from Michael's damage until a certain point? What exactly were they going to do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant for that matter? Why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant too? Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? Why were there fetuses in the lab? The actors seemed to have figured it all out once they saw the fetuses.. But it was never explained to the audience. If you're just going to watch this film to see people get snuffed then this'll be okay for you.. However if you can't stand a plot being thrown at you which remains unresolved by the time the credits roll you should go watch something else. ,negative
 After 15 minutes watching the movie I was asking myself what to do: leave the theater sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth. I finally watched the movie: what a waste of time. Maybe I am not a 5 years old kid anymore! ,negative
 What bird is that ? A maltese falcon. The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines hair. Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it. The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue. Salutes to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime fiction etc... seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency. The reason this film has no 'longevity' and near forgotten is it's so vacuous an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers - This film is what the title suggests... ,negative
 I loathe despise and hate this film with a passion that makes the red hot gates of hell look cold by comparison. it's nothing but a campy frightening and completly shoddy trip down memory lane to that oh-so-nasty time the 70's a decade im glad i wasnt a part of if this absolute trite is all that was on offer! the animation is sickeningly dated not least of all with it's tacky missing frames and characters with huge bulbous heads this film is an eye-sore. from the knowing snide nod to the parents with the freakily gay sea horse and it's camp hand motions and kenneth williams-esque voice to the overtly unsubtly druggy anthem High Cockalorum this film im sad to say is one that was forced upon me as a child and i have never fully recovered from the terror it caused me.... This ghastly display of complete terribleness should carry an R rated certificate so disturbing it is in it's contents! ,negative
 After a meteorite lands in Boston (really somewhere in the Isle of Man) a hideous fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie-like creatures. This film is apparently a loose (and I stress loose) remake of the 1986 film with the same name as it features the same monster but a different plot. Both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable. This isn't. Let's start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad. This film is supposed to take place in Boston (we know this because the film makers had the ingenious idea of putting Boston police or Boston gas company on everything) yet everyone seems to have rather muddled British accents (At least they didn't try using Boston accents thank God). The script is a big flawed mess. The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite. Is that what our brave heroes do? No they run around SHOOTING the zombie-students instead. Nice. Director Paul Matthews who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie Grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films. The movie is terribly boring in places. The lighting is awful. The film looks cheap and bland. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore. 99% of the death scenes involve the creature popping out of a dark corner and dragging someone away while we hear they're horrified screams off in the distance. This convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here. The visual effects were AWFUL. The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake! The explosion of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful. Okay I like to consider myself a fair critic so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool. Gotta love those close-ups of slimy drooling teeth! To sum the film up Breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. Not recommended. 1.5/10. ,negative
 A mediocre at best horror flick that deals with dumb not so horny teens who discover an evil video game (GASP) is killing those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This movie is the sustained mystery of the Mystery Gang in Scooby Doo . I was waiting for them to pull off a mask of one of the villains. I could deal with this for 40 minutes even as a movie on sci-fi but going all the way to the theaters come on people. The effects were very mediocre this whole scenario is something of crummy two-but director Uwe Boll since this would be his cast. As always the great thing about video game systems is the glorious power button. I'd suggest using that mid-viewing. *1/2 ,negative
 Rebecca De Mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she's given to play if you cannot say something nice... De Mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she's a grown up and has become a -of course brilliant- shrink.She has an affair with Banderas whom we suspect of being (ouch!how original!) a serial killer.Sometimes she recalls Banderas's mother-in-law Tippi Hedren's character in Marnie .But I wouldn't count on it:Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him .Here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end but that ending is so far-fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it.The movie includes the obligatory conversations with a serial killer in the silence of the lamb tradition murders (human beings and cats) split personality and open ending in case the crowds should call for more.Apparently they did not and they were right. ,negative
 Your idol will deceive you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old. This makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes basically) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing. The character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe. Nichols who is one of daytime TV's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie: watching him have sex over and over with this girl. It's like watching two animals going at it. If you're a fan of this actor's talent in other projects don't rent this for you will never view him in the same way. If on the other hand you want to see Stephen Nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera you might like it: Stephen will show you his naked butt lots of tongue work his groaning range but not his talent as this character who's obviously just as sex-driven and misjudging as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera. He may have found it kinky but I didn't - a BIG deception! ,negative
 I love the book. It's full of passion romance tension... and the movie drags along taking two spunky stars with it. Kylie Minogue was already a major star in Australia having starred in Neighbours and releasing her first single. The decision to cast her in The Delinquents was surely a marketing ploy. For me it didn't pay off. Kylie may have been great in Neighbours but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the feisty Lola... and she wasn't of Asian descent as Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. By and large the movie was boring. It dragged on it lacked the passion of the book it focused heavily on Kylie and in general was completely disappointing. ,negative
 why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film? it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it it can't be that bad surely. firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real? secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the Blair witch project (yawn) and does so very poorly. so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a Simpson's Halloween special would be far scarier. but if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice. but overall i would avoid this film at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before viewing. the best bit? its only about an hour and a half thank god. ,negative
 I was a hippie age 22 in 1965 have seen the play 5 times have 2 versions of the music and have read the script many times. Maybe taken as an separate thing the movie is OK but as an adoption of the play it's terrible. First the good. The songs are sung well and the production values are pretty good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys White Boys is cute. The Claude/Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is retained. But the basic spirit was very much distorted. It seemed like all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs and fit the story-line to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the play. Claude Sheila and Hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parents party (it's hard to believe that she smiled while her parents were being hurt) and repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly sunburn badly probably be busted in rank and could likely die on that lonely Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud found it fine to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex. This is not what hippies were like not what the play described and is directly opposite to a love generation. I've never seen a hippie beg for money. The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system not beg from it. After Berger is thrown in jail for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers to bail some out Berger insists on being bailed instead with no better plan for bailing the rest that hitting on Sheila's parents and then hitting on his own mommy. Be In has always been a very spiritual point but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around. Even if this is part of his trip it ruins a beautiful song. I know they're contrasting Floating In Space with the Army. But again it totally ruins a beautiful song. While Sheila and Claude are skinny dipping Berger steals their clothes laughing it was fun man even after he could see both were very annoyed. Then a little later Berger does one thing that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Terrible. Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing Starshine at night in some beautiful SF spot with the stars twinkling down maybe working into an inventive duet. Instead the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun speeding down the road in a convertible (stolen of course). I was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979 and I like it even less now. I think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close adoption of the show but this ain't it. ,negative
 This movie is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in Istanbul. As time passes their relationship becomes more and more strained until finally he begins yelling at his house guest--who is out of work and doesn't appear all that eager to find work. That's most of the movie in fact. The problem is that although emotionally constricted and depressed people are VERY withdrawn and non-communicative they don't make for a very satisfying movie. That's because most of the time he (and his roomie) just stare into space and say nothing. I think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie--I certainly wouldn't have minded. ,negative
 I probably have to blame myselfbut I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title Black Dragons and revolves on secret WWII conspiracies Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explication near the end but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before. We see how horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed right before WWII and  especially after witnessing the ending  it surely is a premise with lots of potential so it's quite a shame it isn't elaborated more proper. There is however one great dialogue that I can't resist sharing! Man towards woman: Do you want to marry me? Why? So I can beat you upit's the only way you'll leave this place! It's the only highlight in an overall very boring movie. Bela Lugosi is lovely  as usual  but his spooky performance alone is hardly worth purchasing this film. If you're interested in seeing other ghoulish performances of his (in movies with decent screenplays) check out Invisible Ghost The Corpse Vanishes White Zombie and of course the 1931 Dracula version. ,negative
 Personally the book was a very well written amazing thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie. Watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me seeing that it affected the different outcome of the movie. There was something to be desired out of this movie but all in all it lacked in plot. For someone who has NOT read the book I could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. However to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times I did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel. With major characters missing (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story. The Hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the Illuminati however in the movie his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand. ,negative
 Dull acting weak script...worst spanish movie in years...I was attracted by the (naked) beauty of Paz Vega but as an actress she's useless you almost can't understand what she's saying... About the story there's not much coherent to say...we heard of it before but as this is a modern Carmen we find a few changes: -The french soldier is now a basque soldier. -Merimee himself is a character in the story. -Carmen is a dangerous bandolera in love with a famous matador and she can speak fluent basque... Can anyone understand this mess? ,negative
 Why Lori Petty was cast as tank girl I'll never know. Her acting performance is lack-luster. Her voice is grating. It's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is. There are several modern-pop references in the film which I found to be very strange given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future. It wouldn't have been hard to make this premise interesting either. Some better writing would have helped loads. Naomi Watts makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered techno-geek. I think they should have probably switched roles. I'll never know why anyone would like this movie unless they were a Petty fan. Try not to see this movie. Total waste of time. ,negative
 Well acted yes. Very well I must say even though I don't speak Chezck. Nice cinematography. But the script is lame really lame. A predictable soap opera in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen. OK maybe the ending isn't as predictable but is it any good? It is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already and forget about the day after. I just got a note from IMDb saying that my comment was not long enough. That's really sad because I have no idea of what else to say about this movie which actually says a a lot about it don't you think? The thing is.. .It has no soul and no originality. Compare this movie with Barrio or Riff Raff shot more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recently shot The Child). It's sad to see that this is a much worse film. ,negative
 I rented this movie because the DVD cover made it look like it was going to be a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house. I took it to my friend house to watch for movie night. We ended up stopping it 15 minutes into the film and watched Copper Mountain instead. I don't know if any of you have seen Copper Mountain but it isn't great either. However I would have to say that the Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo made it a more enjoyable watch. I later finished Puddle Cruiser. This movie was slow and the humor was forced. This movie reminded me of some stinkers that I saw in some of my earlier production classes in college. I was left wondering was this the film that enabled Broken Lizard to make Supertroopers? Also how could this movie suck so bad? Supertroopers was good and Club Dread was decent. Don't see this movie! ,negative
 If like me you actively seek out the rarest and weirdest (and often most awful) that world cinema has to offer then you should look no further than the supernatural horror output of Hong Kong in the early 80s. Often mixing bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy and usually packed with plenty of creepy crawlies (snakes worms eels centipedes etc.) these movies are about as bizarre as it gets. Succubare is definitely a case in point: featuring a mountain tribe whose women keep their men from straying by casting nasty spells over them (that should they leave cause them to fill up with writhing creatures and die an agonising death) some so-so martial arts and lots of real life animal killing (much of which is perpetrated by a geek who has absolutely no bearing on the story) this film is just plain strange. A prolonged scene in which the tribeswomen hunt for snakes and insects casually throwing the creatures into the baskets on their backs is quite fascinating; a tribal feast that sees a poor ox bashed on the head and then torn apart is totally disgusting; and the moments that show worms crawling in open wounds and being vomited onto the floor will have the squeamish losing their appetite for a while. However it's the live animal munching that really qualifies Succubare for legendary status amongst fans of out-there movie-making. It's thoroughly vile to watch and yet strangely compelling: the geek chomps on a snake woofs down a fat juicy toad (nasty!) and hungrily devours a mouse (biting off its head and then shoving the rest in afterwards). Not a great movie (hell it's not really even a mediocre movie) Succubare is recommended only to people who think they've seen it all. This one gets 4 out of 10 from me which is probably more than it deserves but I begrudgingly respect it for being able to make me feel slightly ill. ,negative
 This movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay at a house to get money by renovating it and then they find out that the house has a woman Deamon in it and that there is a portal to hell.In this movie there are heaps of stupid scenes like at the start of the movie how they are cleaning the house and they start to dancing to a cheesy song and some of the Demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the Professor gets his face ripped of.I only hired this movie because i am a big fan of horror movies and its only worth watching if u are a fan of horror movies.The acting in this movie is really bad the only good actor is Roy Scheider from the great movie Jaws and over all this movie has heaps of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10. ,negative
 Review: Nunsploitation films. They've been around since forever. A few that pop to mind are the Mexican devil worshiping movie Alucarda Night of the Demons 2 The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. Cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious/holy image and twisting it around to make it scary. If done right it works. Here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled The Nun. The story is about this group of girls that live in a Catholic school. In this school there's a Nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. The girls acting in self defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and tell no one. Fast forward 18 years later and the nun is back searching for revenge from those who killed her. This movie was produced by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know the company that makes horror movies in Spain. Need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company churns out? Well heres a small reminder: Arachnid Darkness Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt Rottweiler. You get the picture. About the only really good movie that this company has produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordons Dagon. Thats it. Oh no wait I believe they also produced the excellent Christian Bale vehicle The Machinist. But thats it. So when I consciously rented this movie I knew I wasn't going to watch anything that was mind blowingly good. Still with all that mental preparation I was disappointed. One of the only good things this movie has going for it is its slick look. The movie has some nice cinematography. It doesn't look like a cheap horror film. The movies special effects were alright with The Nun being able to travel through water. Well that was an image that lended it self for some cool fx moments that sometimes scratched into cheesy territory but sometimes were cool enough to watch. I dug that scene with the Nun hurling herself at people like a bucket of water. Its not a particularly deadly move but it made for a cool visual. There's some gore here but not a lot of it. One particular scene involving an elevator death was cool but sadly the movie hit its peak with that scene. And it was only half way through. After that nothing really cool happens and the movie deludes into an incredible borefest. The movie just turns into The Nun popping up every now and then to give us a boo scare she would kill someone and then CUT! We get back to the characters talking crap going through rooms opening doors you get the drill. And I just personally hate it when a horror movie turns into that. People opening doors and going into rooms. Boring! And when the characters do talk its terrible dialog. In one particularly stupid scene a character decides right out of the blue that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever she is in the water so thats they way to go to try and kill her. And everyone just says OK! And they all elaborate this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. Now who gave that guy this info and why did the others just take it for granted? Who the hell knows but its scenes like that that make the movie look stupid. And yet another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this film was the fact that they used Spanish actors who have a very thick accent. When they try to speak English its very hard to make out what the hell they are trying to say. Id prefer to have them be dubbed then try and figure out what they are saying and become frustrated. The fact that this DVD has no English subtitles didn't help matters either. So in conclusion this is a movie that has some slick visuals nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script. I guess this just goes to show that you might have the biggest budget or the best special effects but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience cant connect with then you've still got a bad movie. Such was the case with The NUN. If you want to have some real fun with evil nuns rent any of the films I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now as for the makers of this film they should go say ten hail maries and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they'll be forgiven for making this sinfully terrible film. Rating: 2 out of 5. ,negative
 The Quickie tells of a decadent Russian mob family who lives in Malibu and...well frankly this awful attempt at drama isn't worthy of commentary. Jason Leigh introduces herself to Mr. Mob-guy as being from Pacific Exterminators with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say West Coast Exterminators . Eventually the mob-guys get suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom. (duh). In another scene Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette giving a hooker $4000 to bet whether he'll live or die. She has 5 chances out of 6 of keeping the money if she bets live . Well she bets die . (double duh) Later she complains it wasn't fair and wants to play again. (Triple duh). The list of flaws just goes on and on while this intelligence insulting film stinks and sinks in a quagmire of lousy music mediocre camera work poor direction boring story etc. Pass on this loser. (D) Note - The barebones DVD which I rented had no English same language subtitles or closed captions. ,negative
 Problem Child 2 was a complete waste of my time. The original film wasn't very good but its a classic compared to this film. The first film went over the top with its scenes of a devilish child wrecking major havoc in the lives of everyone he's around. Here it goes even further over the top. And one scene in this movie proves that theory. That carnival ride sequence was too much for me to stomach. It's awful. This movie shouldn't have been made. 1/2* (out of four) ,negative
 Okay wait let me get this street there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. Pah what nonsense don't believe them I've watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of S is one of the Worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life. Frankly if i was John Carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish two was crap three was stupid four is alright five is well five H20 alright Resurrection painful. Yet in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. Why? Well let me just embark on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why Halloween 6 the Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time. OK where should i start ah yes the plot oh boy the plot. Basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults signs of Thor and some other crap. It's just stupid it really is the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet its heaped together in such a horribly made way. Why does Michael Myers got to have a reason for killing people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives that would suffice but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and utter crap. God its so bad it made me want to cry it really did the writers have tried to add to the character of Myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit < which is a completely different colour by the way Myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two heck maybe even four. Thats another thing why has Myers become a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it was meant to be the other way round yet Myers is so similar to Jason all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways. In the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful. In this he just walks around hacking people to death. I mean in the space of Half an Hour we had equalled the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a really big head i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight. What else is crap oh yeah the return of Tommy Jarvis thats pretty bad in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar Dr Loomis of course. I can't stand the little kid i wish he had got it he's really irritating. Our Heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors. The mother is rubbish the brother is bad and the Father i mean was this his first part or something? He was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than Myers < By the way his death is one of the most abysmal i've ever seen i think even Friday the 13th wouldn't come up with something so entirely laughable. What else is rubbish oh yeah Tommy Jarvis don't know the name of the guy but he really can't act he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really. There is Dr Loomis a horribly aged and dieing Donald Pleasence by all account. Despite him being on his last legs Pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features. Its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this. What else is rubbish oh yeah the bit where the radio DJ gets it. Firstly how the hell did Michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house? Secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film. Its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film. ,negative
 Jack Frost 2 is out of the question I'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies. As Sam and his wife take to the Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas Jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding... Don't take a swip at this film at all most people say its a laugh with your mates but frankily its a waste of time. If the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story especially the cheesy character names. ,negative
 This movie was really bad. I mean really really bad. The scenes were like from a parody and special effect sucked a lot. And it was filmed in 2003!!! i think this was a great waste of time and money and Michael Shanks with his 'Shaggy from Scooby Doo' image just made me laugh. Never waste your time with this picture... I really don't know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look on them. The 'latex cat women' fighters were like sheep just rolling around the scenes and looking frightened around like they had no clue what to do on the scene... I think this is a beautiful example of Bottom 100 picture. ,negative
 I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be filmed in Los Angeles it should be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this movie should be made in Hawaii's state capital. This movie should be filmed in Hawaii because this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles but there are no volcanoes. To be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish. In conclusion I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense. ,negative
 It's dreadful rubbish. I liked 'How Do You Want Me' 'Father Ted' 'Green Wing' and Bill Bailey's standup act but I file this with 'Hippies' and 'Planets Of The Apes' (the re-imagining) under 'Great Pedigree went badly wrong'. My guess is that it appeals to the same people who like 'Withnail and I'. It's overwritten but to little end a luvvie-ish air pervades it and Bernard Black is simply a less camp Withnail. And I thought it was self-indulgent even *before* Dylan Moran became the writer. But the set up raidiates such comic potential that for the first 2 episiodes I didn't even notice that it wasn't in the slightest bit chortle-worthy. The things they are saying/doing *should* be funny but somehow they don't manage to register as more than mildly amusing or I can see how someone writing this down might have thought that this would be funny . What I am trying to say is that the situations/remarks are mildly humorous and yet too mundane/gentle/self-consciously surreal to be worth creating for and depicting in a sitcom. Life is too short. Avoid. ,negative
 Note to self. Never ever ever again watch a serious movie with Charlie Sheen in it. Great comedian horrible seal. This movie makes Navy SEALS look like a reckless group of rangers when in fact they are the most elite form of military in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the Navy SEAL reputation. Thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. This is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie but why Charlie Sheen? There are possibilities for a very passionate story here but Sheen decides to wreck them with funny comments. ,negative
 Me being from Australia and loving the series I wasn't expecting much from the American version of Kath and Kim but I thought I'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad. Well whats there to say. Its nothing special.Selma Blair is OK as Kim and actually had a few good lines Molly Shannon is not a good Kath though. The good thing about Jane Turner's Kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents (such as when she says Yumor or Noice) it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks but when Shannon has a go at the accent its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the show really misses Sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about because the Kal and Craig characters in this version are really not funny. So far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the Aussie version although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name not being compared to the Aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better. But if there is nothing else to do on a Sunday night (or Thursday night in America) then you cant do much harm in watching it or better put on some of the Aussie version if you've got it. ,negative
 The scariest thing about freshman director Carter Smith's new horror movie The Ruins is the closing credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What was Stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them. Oscar-nominated scenarist Scott B. Smith of A Simple Plan adapting his own bestselling novel sticks steadfastly to the standard clichés and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas where reckless youth do everything but tote signs begging the forces of evil to eat them. Were cretinous characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense we're treated to yet another film where American tourists find themselves in jeopardy simply because they are Americans. Furthermore unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed The Ruins provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its villainous vines. The set-up for The Ruins resembles the 2006 horror movie Turistas where slimy South Americans trapped brainless American backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. Indeed Turistas generated some legitimate thrills and chills. The Ruins spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills. A malicious mastiff that suddenly lurches on-camera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill. The rest of The Ruins borrows from another movie: The Descent a superb 2006 chiller about a bunch of babes plunged into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. A couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind too. They are the straightforward 1968 Hammer horror classic The Lost Continent about murderous vegetation that menaces innocent bystanders in a sea of derelict ships and the Roger Corman cult class The Little Shop of Horrors (1961)about a New York florist that grows a man-eating plant in his shop.. The Ruins unfolds in the scenic sunny Mexico where four frolicking American college kids Eric (Shawn Ashmore of the X-Men movies) Stacy (Laura Ramsey of The Covenant ) Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of Sleepers ) and Amy (Jena Malone of Pride & Prejudice ) are wrapping up their tequila-soaked spring break. Stacy loses a prized earring in a motel swimming pool but a helpful Teutonic twentysomething tourist Mathias (Joe Anderson of Copying Beethoven ) recovers it and the group embraces him as newest best friend. These people live to party and they have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his wayward brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that isn't listed in any guidebooks. He offers to take them with him and they accept. First rule of horror movies: if nobody knows about the place where you're going you'd be well advised to avoid it. Since they have only one day left and they haven't done anything adventurous our two couples along with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas) decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid out. They catch a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A cabbie glances at their map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies: when the natives warn you to steer clear you steer clear. A crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind and he hauls them off to their destination and then he skedaddles in a heartbeat. No sooner have our heroes found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted and they kill Dimtri without a qualm when he tries to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists scramble to safety atop the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Eventually the vines slink out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point The Ruins turns into Bug the recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid movie about insects that get under your skin. Before long our heroes are carving each other up in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. One particularly gruesome scene shows the Americans lopping off the German guy's legs to save his life. By comparison it makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition look tame. The Ruins ranks as just another vine mess with nothing to redeem it. ,negative
 Now I understand that this took two months to shoot. Really? I'm pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week. This movie sucked so bad I couldn't even pay close attention. Just more proof that boob bearing women can't always save you from horrible writing acting and direction. Now I understand it was a no budget endeavor but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you don't understand. Oh there are a few decent looking females showing the goods. Still there aren't enough sexy women alive to warrant watching this travesty perpetrated on the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I trooped it out though with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you may want to use it after this hack job. Lastly the individual (moron) who left a comment before mine thought this was a great movie and LOVED it. Just more proof that siblings shouldn't pro-create. Ow BURN!!! - Captain J ,negative
 All I can say about this movie is it is absolutely boring. The intro to the movie is quite possibly the worst intro to a horror film I have ever seen I mean a angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan isn't at all frightening which is what I assume the director was aiming for but in fact it was mildly funny. The acting in this picture was beyond pathetic; a note to directors if your making a horror film please hire some good actors not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act. The death scenes in this movie were beyond boring... no gore and i'm sorry but horror movies without gore or good suspense are just cheesy. I mean this girl gets killed by hair wrapped all around her in the middle of Tokyo and not one person sees it happen they just declare her as missing wow thats awesome! In conclusion if you and your friends want to see this movie make sure u bring some sleeping pills because I guarantee you won't make it to the end.. Me and my friend walked out cause we didn't even care what happened at the end. Cheers ,negative
 I've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It seemed dull to me much as I enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz and the plot details often poorly worked out. It also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist. It's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor. Utopias are notoriously dull and this one turns out to be no exception. But it's also interesting to notice what happens (and here comes the plot giveaway though it refers to a very early scene) when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) Her mother rushes to take responsibility for it and(2) the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film). It's not quite a glorified killing though Aldomovar's camera lingers on the blood in a bloodthirsty way as though it makes an attractive painting and then it's soaked up and out of sight without bloodying either daughter or mom neither materially nor emotionally. Later the film reveals another killing again by a woman of a man and once again it is a killing which the film implicitly endorses.In short Volver is an ideologically-driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a repugnant ideology and so I write an ideological critique. But apart from that it's just not very interesting. It has none of the depth of say Aldomovar's Talk to Her which I loved. ,negative
 This is slightly less sickening than the first two films but otherwise it's business as usual: a scuzzy sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema. Charles Bronson is back blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood. Crime you see is up 11% in the South Belmont area... so what's to be done? A stronger police presence? Tougher jails? Harsher sentences? Nope the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like Bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge  or as the writers would have it justice: this time he's the personal killing machine of police chief Ed Lauter. The writers bend over backwards to make Kersey the hero sending the useless cops into the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection and supplying a scene in which Kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back to applause from the watching crowd. Capital punishment for theft? Well okay. The attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer Kersey on or back him up is appalling. Sure these villains are scum but shouldn't the film leave the audience to make up its mind rather than slanting the entire thing towards Kersey and his mindless answer? Funnily enough the beleaguered residents don't fear gang reprisals or blame Kersey for any of the violence which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being. The atrociously shallow performances don't help  Bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can't even put inflection on the right words. New heights of stupidity are reached here  a machine gun? A rocket launcher?!  and new lows of misogyny: the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight whether by rape explosion or throat-slashing; and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion like one victim who ventures into the crime-ridden gang-controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger or another who goes shopping alone at night. This is dreck pure and simple mindless garbage put together without style or sense. ,negative
 Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Pathetic in almost every way. I threw the DVD straight in the bin - I didn't even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shop. The effects are beyond a joke. The dam control room looks like cardboard. The water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds - nothing works. Then there is the limp plot - about as much depth as a Scooby Doo cartoon. I couldn't wait for them all to drown. ,negative
 This is a really really bad movie. That may seem like an oversimplification. A fickle childish retort comparable to a petty unsubstantiated insult. The truth is there is not enough I can say about the confusing senseless plot the really atrocious acting (I'm talking nasty here folks) or the random images of violence toward women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrendous film-making mistakes that propel this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema nay human culture. Please take my word for it don't watch it... ever. I'm serious. Stop. You'll thank me for it later. ,negative
 Just when you think that you've seen the worst the zombie sub-genre can offer along comes another budding Romero and his team of no-talent mates to prove you wrong. I've suffered the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy endured Death Valley: The Revenge of Bloody Bill sat semi-comatose through The Zombie Diaries and laughed hysterically during Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence and genuinely thought that amateur movie-making could sink no lower. However having just watched Zombie Planet a two hour long festering pile of drivel from writer/director George Bonilla I think I have found the ultimate in awful zombie movies. In this dreadfully amateurish effort which is part Mad Max and part Dawn of the Dead (but ALL bad) Frank Farhat stars as T. K. Kane a tough fighter who kicks zombie ass for a hobby armed only with knives a machete some concussion grenades and what he obviously perceives to be a really mean glare. After a desperately unexciting opening sequence in which he takes on a horde of dodgy looking zombies Kane teams up with a group of survivors who not only have to fend off attacks from the undead but must also must placate a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area (by searching for and handing over any valuables that they find). Of course Kane isn't the type of man to take orders from a bunch of z-grade post-apocalyptic bully boys and he sets about teaching the bad guys a lesson (mostly by glowering at them in a threatening manner) only pausing to periodically rescue pals from zombies. Featuring awful acting from almost everyone involved a dreadful script laughable effects and shoddy production values there is virtually nothing in this film to make it worth a watch. To be fair I quite like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular slimming drug that blocks cravings for carbohydrates (we learn this when one character conveniently explains the back-story to Kane who strangely has no idea what has happened) but this is about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole production. I have a certain amount of respect for anyone who manages to fund and make their own movie but when the results are this poor that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing. I would've kept this one under wraps if I had made it. ,negative
 I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and liked it a great deal. I don't know what happened with the film version because it was dreadful. Perhaps some dialogue that works on stage just sounds incoherent on screen. Anyway I couldn't wait for this film to be over. The acting is universally over the top. Only Kevin Spacey has it together and he seems like he knows he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out. ,negative
 Mainly a biography of a lustful doctor Robert Merivel (Robert Downey) who has his way in the king's palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in the second half mainly Katharine (Meg Ryan). The GOOD - Fantastic set decoration (i.e. the lush king's palace) and costuming make this a visual treat. The language is also very tame. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant provide interesting support. The BAD - After 50-60 minutes this movie simply gets too boring. It desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite: it drags on and on. The script certainly needed some badly-needed restoration shall we say? The film may look nice but it's a long two hours to sit through.....too long. ,negative
 Tyrone Power was cast in the lead as Solomon. However part-way through the film he died unexpectedly. The studio chose to cast Yul Brynner in the lead and re-shoot the scenes that Power had done. In hindsight considering how awful this film was Power was lucky--as this would have been a horrible way to end his lovely film career!!! Of all the Biblical epics I have seen this one is by far the worst--and that's saying a lot because Hollywood has made many dull Biblical tales--so many you wonder if the creation of these films was an Atheist conspiracy!! In fact the film was so dull that it deservedly was included in Harry Medved's brilliant book The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time . There are so many reasons to hate the film but the worst is how incredibly ponderous the whole thing was! Sure casting people with Italian Eastern European Scottish and English accents to play Egyptians and Israelis was pretty bad--but at least this made the film oddly humorous. Having bosomy Gina Lollobrigida playing the role of a woman reputed to have come from a place around Ethiopia was also just awful but at least she was beautiful even if she couldn't act. Having an overweight and post-middle aged George Sanders play such a young role was also pretty bad but at least he had a pretty voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and revoltingly dull was pretty bad but at least you got to see in the credits a mention of a person as the orgy choreographer ! No the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours it seemed like nine it was so poorly paced and insipid! Considering that the only mention of this Queen of Sheba and Solomon is only in a few measly verses in the Old Testament it's amazing the film just went on and on and on. THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD was a bit longer but that movie was based on four gospels--not a dozen or so verses! The bottom line is that the film is wretched in practically every way (except for Gina's cleavage). Even for devoted Christians and Jews this is a must-avoid film because it plays so fast and loose with the truth as well as injects an amazing amount of sex into a Biblical film!!! Terrible in almost every way it is truly a blessing for Tyrone Power that he's not remembered for starring in this bloated turkey. ,negative
 This was so bad I can't even review it. So I'll jot some sentences about what I witnessed and it'll be up to you to decide. Captain Kirk with toupee and tubby gut is rock climbing Yosemete's El Capitan. Spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboard-like hovercraft. Kirk falls. Spock flies down catches him inches before Kirk hits the ground head- first. Later that night Spock Kirk and McCoy are eating beans around a campfire. Spock likes the beans. Then Kirk and McCoy sing Row Row Row Your Boat and want Spock to join in on the three-way harmony. Spock doesn't want to sing. And later that night he disagrees. But life isn't but a dream Captain . Should I go on? Okay... A renegade Vulcan who happens to be Spock's half brother leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the enterprise land on the planet and Uhura pushing fifty-five and weighing two-hundred some-odd pounds lures the natives with her bare legs. But they can't trick the brother who claims he can find God. He kidnaps the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a big bearded apparition claiming to be God spits fire at Kirk Spock and McCoy. Spock's sibling realizing it isn't God - but is really a form of himself - or something - joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and... sparks fly. Then after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving Klingons who resemble Lorenzo Lamas... The Three Amigos - Kirk Spock and McCoy - return to Yosemite (did I mention Kirk was wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt?). With Spock playing some kind of funky Vulcan guitar they sing Row Row Row Your Boat this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll. ,negative
 The plane is a 747 Jumbo. The cockpit is located on the upper deck on a 747. In the movie the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st Class cabin to reach the cockpit. They walk to the front of the 1st Class cabin and through doors into the cockpit. What a gaff !!! The front of the first class cabin has a cloakroom for jackets and a TV screen. Beyond that is the radar dome. Before takeoff a 747 is shown to commence the taxi to the runway. On take-off the plane is shown to have only two engines. Areal 747 has four engines. Who was in charge of continuity on this movie ? During the early part of the flight the front of the plane suddenly includes toilets - another farcical gaff !!! After that the front of the plane becomes the rear and vice-versa. At this point I stopped watching. Absolute rubbish!!! ,negative
 -may contain spoilers- Clearly who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections. I just can't see it any other way. What really surprises me is no one used the name Allen Smithee and more surprising everyone involved didn't use this name. Anyhow where to begin. The bad dialogue the crummy costumes the sorry looking film stock the unintentional comedy the over-the-top characters and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's college career. I don't know what was funnier the guy losing his arm because of a snowball or the slow motion scene where all the baby Jack Frosts' were getting killed. Also one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film. How do we know it's him? Like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! A great camp film but a very bad film overall. ,negative
 In the last few years of Ron Miller's (son-in-law of Walt Disney cum Producer) reign he churned out live-action crap on a stick often starring the very boring Dean Jones whose entire career was based on that kind of light empty-headed fare. Other horrible films from that same period include Pete's Dragon the Last Flight of Noah's Ark Unidentified Flying Oddball and the dreaded Condorman. I'll not mention Tron because I thought it ambitious and Miller was only the executive Producer on it so he had little to do with the actual production. However he was in full force when this god-awful piece of human junk was expelled from the bowels of creativity. Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo. Second sequel to much- loved Love Bug tale finds Herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too. There's a race some lame bad guys a diamond and Barney Fife. Shot in France the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely. But one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in France. The rest of film is a wreck. Prat falls bumbling thieves wicked German racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply. The biggest insult of the film: trying to further develop Herbie's lover personality via shakes beeps flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old Disney's writers do an injustice to our cute little VW. Then again I would think it'd be tough for anyone to top Helen Hayes driving Herbie around a skyscraper ledge in the second outing. ,negative
 I think the best way for me to review this title is to split it into its pros and cons. PROS: ~ they turn into wolves rather than plastic/cartoony monsters. ~ the chase of the wolves through the forest ~ Cash Machine by Hard-Fi being played CONS: ~ some parts of the script makes you cringe (for example the terrible part where the woman escapes the 'games' of the Fortunate Five boys and there's about half an hour of Dear cousin and a round robin of Yes see we know Gabriel's law ) ~ the diving transformation is ridiculous ~ the obvious and ridiculous ending ~ Aiden being told thousands of times to leave and then goes if you cared about me you would have left me ~ the obvious characters ~ the unnecessary parcour ~ the completely unnecessary slashing of the arm by Aiden ~ cringey speeches by Gabriel You see what I mean. I adore werewolf films and I tried watching this a few times to see if I'd like it better but it just made it worse. I think I'll just read the book and see how I get on. Don't bother with this unless you have a 12 year old brother or sister into spooky things. Anyone over that age may suffer and want their hour and a half back. ,negative
 Great premise poor execution. Cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written poorly directed poorly edited waste of film. Only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food. Joan Chen Mercedes Ruehl Kyra Sedgwick and Alfre Woodard should fire their agents. ,negative
 i expected this movie to be absolutely god awful. Like What Dreams May Come or The Truman Show or something. Well they were selling it off for £3.99 in my local HMV and it had Giovanni Ribisi on the cover you know you cant help but love him and so my friends dared me to buy it. and i was sure it was going to be trash. maybe thats the only reason i could sit through this movie because my standards were never that high. ,negative
 I saw this film at the 2005 Edinburgh International Film Festival. This film had been compared in the EIFF program to Sideways - which I liked - so I was quite looking forward to this movie. I also liked Garden State Napoleon Dynamite etc... so I have had good recent experiences with slightly weird American indy films. Unfortunately I found that Puffy Chair does not compare favourably with any of these movies. I was sitting for 35 minutes waiting for something amusing witty insightful or even mildly interesting to happen. It didn't - and the shaky video cam was making me sick - so I left. This is only the second film I have ever walked out from (the first was Showgirls ) which is slightly disappointing. I probably could have lasted the duration had it not been for the nauseating effects of the wobbly picture - but nothing within the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that I would be missing anything. Disappointing. ,negative
 Looking all of 29 years old Rob Lowe is a detective in charge of a murder investigation. When the husband of a society woman (Leslie Hope) is found dead police suspect the rich chick might have something to do with it. Enter Rob who immediately falls for the pretty widow even though he claims that he's just trying to be 'helpful'. Rob is such a good cop he is able to sneak some of her incriminating love letters into his coat pocket before he accidentally throws them into the fireplace. Monotonous murky drama with an endless drone of background music. This is a good substitute sleeping remedy if you've run out of Sominex. ,negative
 Not just because of that theme in the movie. Which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot. No. I watched this knowing I would not like it. I HATE numerology. Whenever someone starts going off about patterns with numbers I feel the urge to slap them. My own brain starts hurting out of empathy. And fully aware this is a movie just about that topic I couldn't resist the urge to watch it and maybe get a good laugh. But it wasn't funny. Just exactly the dumb sort of Isn't this totally scary and yet amazingly cool?! I can turn any crap into 23! dialog I was afraid of. As soon as the son started to chime in I knew this movie is a turd no matter what happens. But I hardly ever stop watching a movie I started. I sat through it. I enjoy the pain. The movie pretends to mock numerology under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly. But it rides that wave as much as it's supposed to crush it. I don't see that message. I only see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify. Top that off with the usual surprises - trying to put another twist to throw you off that makes no sense and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narration up to there - and you get one hollow piece of movie-making. That just happens to be centered around the topic I despise. If only it did not try to be serious and rather had been some hilarious movie with actors I don't give a damn about. But I was starting to like Carrey...while it's not his fault he is trying. It's not even good for watching with a bunch of friends and mst3k the hell out of it. My expectations were low enough for someone to trip on them but this movie managed to live up to be one of the worst I've ever seen. ,negative
 This was truly the most painful experience I have had in quite some time in a movie theater. I will forego such facile criticisms as 'maudlin' or 'historically inaccurate' or 'horse's crap's crap' because quite simply our sympathies would then immediately go out to these words. If a director's to make a sweeping grandiose love epic well for god's sake MAKE A REAL DAMN SWEEPING GRANDIOSE LOVE EPIC! Why bother with such laughably unconvincing second rate harlequin romances and such boring interchanges between characters we could care less about when the most decisive battle on Canadian soil is taking place? And for the pompous people thinking 'oh well this story must center characters! well you're wrong dead wrong. ,negative
 Ha ha! First of if you've never seen a Dimension Film your in for a real treat! Known primarily for SUPER LOW BUDGET Horror/Slasher films Beowulf was no exception. However this video was more in the style of ultra-cheesy. I missed the K-R-A-F-T label on the side. Consider the Anachronisms! (something out of place and time) We had: candles armour swords.... Yet we saw: telescopes Soled Shoes Cigarette lighters Loudspeakers Electricity Body Bags aluminum foil tins and spoons/forks. Not bad for something that takes place in like the 8th Century! This is not a horror film is a horrible film. Its very laughable. Its really a comedy made to look like a horror film! I couldn't stop laughing! Christopher Lambert ( The Highlander Series ) -- must have really taken a tumble in his career if he's working for Dimension Films. I've learned my lesson though. I'll be looking at the film studios on the videos a LOT more closely now. RATED NO REELS OUT OF FIVE. If you want a good laugh though its hard to pass up on this piece of work! This move had some cleavage in spots -- I especially liked the blonde bimbette! Wayno ,negative
 I usually love these movies. Give me a good old B movie any day but this one was simply awful. The acting(?) was terrible almost to the point of my turning the movie off completely. I thought I saw the all time worst but this one is right up there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! In all honesty - it was the acting that did this film in for me. I found the actor's to be clumsy and the lead male/female were extremely dull. This movie had absolutely nothing going for it. I may be asking a ridiculous question here but why the nudity and sex scene? Did the producers think nobody would watch if they left them out? I think they were probably right! Oh where is Price and The Tingler when you need them? ,negative
 Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger than she actually was in this poor excuse for a musical. The movie features some of the worst choreography ever seen laced with the constant threat that Lucy might break into song with her bourbon voice at any moment. Lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before it can begin and aside from die-hard Lucy fans no one is likely to fancy it very much. Bad costumes and cheesy set designs don't help. Further proof that Lucy wasn't good at anything except making stupid faces. Directed by Gene Saks. ,negative

 I tried to love this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon plays a cerebral palsy victim who is befriended by a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging to China flying away in a balloon and so on are her way of coping with a dreary existence. I admit I did fast-forward through one of the scenes in which the two of them share friendship and simple pleasures while soulful piano music plays in the background. Okay three or four of those type scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Okay okay it was fourteen. But I did sit and watch most of them. ,negative
 How dare you? Adam Low without apparent shame puts his name to this fake tribute. It's not even a serious study or analysis or commentary of the great Visconti's work. Yes it's long and portentous yes we do have some wonderful clips from the films that most people interested on the subject have already seen. But what resounds the longest leaving the most lasting impression is the gossip. The last and loudest voice comes from a third rate German actor ranting and raving. The appropriately named Mr.Low directed this hoping I imagine to get better ratings than his previous more to the point but deadly boring documentary on Kurosawa. Well I have news for you Mr Low and your cohorts. You missed a great opportunity and I for one won't give you another. ,negative
 I have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed. And in my opinion this movie lacks heart. I frankly didn't care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie. There was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn't because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life or trying so hard not to that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it. I have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. But I felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and I was left wondering what the point was or if the point of the movie was that it had no point. Honestly while I didn't feel like tearing my hair out during the movie I did remorse the lost time on the sad little film. I have no doubt that some people will love this movie but frankly I didn't. ,negative
 I am writing this review simply because I am a huge fan of the book Prozac Nation and was appalled by the film. I think that if you hadn't read the book you would have been lost watching the film as it provided no real back story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father her experiences at summer camp her first therapists (in fact the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling)...). That said if you had read the book you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place. I found the book to be a vivid portrayal of depression highlighting Wurtzel's low points and the experiences she had along the way. The film however began at Harvard and literally threw the audience straight in with no real explanation of what was going on. Events that in the book were important (such as Wurtzel's miscarriage her summer working in Dallas her suicide attempt whilst on Prozac) were omitted from the film. Also this is pedantic but Wurtzel did not lose her virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt that was shown in Sterling's office was completely different to the book. For a start she actually overdosed on Mellaril as opposed to the para-suicidal gesture shown in the film. All in all I would say that if you have read the book and enjoyed it/identified with it then don't watch the film. Read 'More Now Again' (by the same author) instead. Or watch Girl Interrupted. The only redeeming feature was the performance by Anne Heche who I believe portrayed Dr. Sterling very well. Christina Ricci was also good though her performance seemed a little... stilted. Jessica Lange made for enjoyable viewing but looked the opposite of how Wurtzel's mother is described in the book. Conclusion? Don't bother. ,negative
 I have never seen a B movie like this one... on the part that the nanny Sofia is being killed... a hand of a woman appears on the tape handling the stick... how bad is that??? LOL I seriously laughed and wanted to stop seeing the movie but I kept watching it to see if this movie could get worse...LOL...it is bad for itself... poor Pinocchio.. the only nice bit is the first time you see some special effects of Pinocchio's face moving... apart from that the whole movie is awful... it's not really worth your time if you don't really have much to spare! But if you have nothing to do... go on... treat yourself with some Z movie cos B-movie is still too good for this one...LOL ,negative
 A four-and-a-half-hour O'Neill play gets boiled down to a little under two and much of that running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters' thoughts in voice-over. It can work onstage but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap-opera adaptation which soft-peddles its heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland overacting ludicrously are outclassed by a naturalistic Clark Gable--he's the only one who makes the frozen-face technique work. It gets even funnier when Shearer's and Gable's son a surly moppet does the frozen-face shtick. There are also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph as an unsuccessful suitor given to soliloquizing poor Charlie! over and over again and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they show up the voice-overs have largely been abandoned and it plays as a ripe soap with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays Silver Threads Among the Gold as background music. Robert Leonard's direction is stodgy and he shows little facility for reining in hyperactive actors. It's certainly entertaining--there's nothing else like it unless you count Groucho's satirical parody in Animal Crackers or an old Mad Magazine satire that rendered Shirley Booth's sitcom Hazel a la Strange Interlude . But it isn't good. ,negative
 With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. This movie is high on story but low on character. You never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described at hit and miss. Of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor at this lot. It is a shame how bad he uses good talent. Many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors. ,negative
 In the 3rd installment of Left Behind the makers did not care to put ANY KIND OF CONTINUITY into the plot. Although all weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the United Nations World War III suddenly begins at the snap of a finger. Within a few split-seconds the ex-lover of one of the main protagonists moves from passionately seducing him to outright hatred to a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction. But foremost this film is really an irony-free zone. After the president of the United States accepts Jesus as his savior he immediately becomes a suicide bomber and blows up a skyscraper in the middle of the city. Osama Bin Laden will be very jealous when he sees this film! ,negative
 It starts quite good but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting. Everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays. Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. But after they transfered to Capitalistic country here it is Czech unofficial but well known mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING of everything they consider good when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere. I think that this is a good example of making art and politics and horror and humor and film and money. And it remains me of the /One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest/ which can not be compared to this film in the way of ART and ACTORS and STORY and POLITICS. I think this film is boring. It could be done better. At least they tried. Sorry guys. :-( CANOT NOT Recommend ,negative
 A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville. Despite warnings by the local sheriff Murphy(John Phillip Law) Old Man Prichard(Richard Lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible Wanted posters and kooky superstitious Aunt Nelly(Karen Black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(Jeff Conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft) these people only see the green not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact they line their pockets and carrying cases prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. But when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons the obvious result will be gruesome death. Jeremiah Stone as we see is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up the pickax underneath awaiting it's master with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition his eyes aglow with wrath. This hapless group hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle directing it's path straight into her neck. Another failed attempt to retreat has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. Another a local girl searching for her new friends worried about their well being receives the pickax buried into her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. Will anybody survive? Or is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner? Make-up effects artist and monster creator John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. He provides just enough back story and this is feeble at best for the killer allowing special guest star Karen Black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Startling enough Stone plants that pickax right into her back with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain the mine shaft Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his the loot. Typical of most slashers in general this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. They are the usual group from the city trespassing unto unfamiliar territory resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers a good deal of the violence is off-screen. What is on screen the minimal gore is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. One thing's for certain stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband Caleb now living with a much younger and dense honey. Vernon Wells(..of The Road Warrior and Commando fame)has the back story role of Jeremiah Stone as a human still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. Buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts showing off their sleek and athletic figures especially Elina Madison as easy-lay Roxann always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk Hayden(Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell(The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl a rather clumsy foil used as a butt of many jokes including his dump in the woods scene and current unemployment status. ,negative

 This old stinker makes the Flash Gordon movies look sophisticated. It's so terrible I love it and I wish I could find a tape but none of the catalogs I've checked list it. The rock band leader who calls himself Commander Cody must have loved it too because he named his band after it. ,negative
 Me and my friend read the summery and watched the trailer and were very interested and excited to go rent this movie. BAD IDEA. We thought a movie with actors that influential would have been a sure hit but our expectations fell extremely short. First of all the trailer and summery are misleading to the point of lies. The movie started out slow for the first 1 1/2 hours(reminder its about two hours long) and when it finally started to gain momentum It sucked. Plus the plots were very hard to follow. It confused us because it kept skipping from one story to another in random order. The characters where not very realistic when it came to reality. Sure the mum and son could be actual people in reality but everyone else seemed to be one extreme or the other. If your a person who likes sick twisted unusual movies then go for it. But we advise not wasting two hours of you life you cant get back. Unfortunitly no one told us that... ,negative
 I saw this film in a Cinema-Club in Germany in 1970. Most of the attendees were from the local private school at which I was teaching. I had seen a few Godard films previously while I lived in France and though they hadn't been my favorites I could at least make sense of them. Being able to speak French helped. The fairly innocuous beginning of Le week-end soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images very well maybe too well photographed that soon made no sense to me. For me films like books must have some clear sort of meaning. This didn't for me. I suppose I'm not into artsy films. Images still haunt me from the film. To this day I refuse to eat rabbit meat well-loved by the French. Those who've seen the film might realize why. Yes the theme of materialism came through but the cannibalism the car wrecks and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only sickened me. I'm not sure if I walked out before the end but I certainly felt like it. I promised myself that I'd never watch another Godard film and I haven't and never knowingly will. My rating: nothing. It was the most disgusting film I've ever seen. Others may have been more inept silly or stupid. I've forgotten those while scenes from this one will haunt me forever. ,negative
 Its almost embarrassing to say I even saw this movie. I mean it doesn't take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects lots of blood and gore some scary moments and a decent plot. Does House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right? No not one. Of course its not as bad as its predecessor from Uwe Bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me. The dialog in this movie is notorious with such lines as What do you do for a living? in response I kill zombies and I was never a disk jockey I was a soldier. The special effects are embarrassing even for a made for TV movie I mean seriously the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack. The army base in this movie is a parking garage with a desk and a open gated room. This movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co-ed locker rooms. In fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school. Also why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models? And for that matter why is everyone in this movie so clueless at to what is going on that they simply just stand around letting the zombies kill them. Heck one guy even trys to give food to the zombie. Overall this movie makes even the worst of Scifi Channel movies looks fantastic. ,negative
 SPOILER - This film gives away plot points and discusses the ending. I hated this film - mostly for political reasons but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically this film glorified war and military technology - blowing things up real good. We are led to cheer as the music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to blow the Ruskies to bits. And no U.S. soldiers put their lives on the line - so it's a fun war. Aesthetically there isn't a touch of real human emotion in the film just smug privileged people being sarcastic feeling superior and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences. And speaking of consequences the film only makes a few small hits at what the arming of the Afghans actually led to. I had read an earlier draft of this script and it ended on 9/11 - with Charlie Wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong. But that wouldn't leave the audience feeling good. This is a feel good movie about killing Ruskies. And it made me sick. ,negative
 Just been on sci-fi channel UK 5th July its was ****. Shame on JRD! May be he was bored one week ! He cant be skint after LOTR. I suppose he wasn't to blame. Mr Sheppird was. I turned off after 50 minutes couldn't bear it. The cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large 5 foot bat. Who funded this project? I think the whole thing must have cost $250 bucks. Avoid at all costs don't think about buying the DVD if they release one I cant imagine they would spend dollars on producing one. Lets hope someone makes a decent Chupra film and a decent BIGFOOT movie. Sasquatch was okay poor Lance. Its a shame a big studio and direct wont risk it no more super hero films please! ,negative
 This movie is on the level with Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael for biggest pieces of garbage that have ever hit the silver screen. If these guys weren't Adam Sandler's gay friends this script would have ended up where it should have: as some big time movie exec's toilet paper. I hate this movie it makes me want to injure people. I will admit that I have high standards but honestly I'd rather watch Step Up 2. The ultra sad part was when I logged onto IMDb and read that you pieces of trash actually gave this movie a 6.9 rating. This is a testament to all of the retards in our society that will go watch terrible movies that are just hour and a half long dick fart and weed jokes with little to no originality. After seeing this rating I would like to suggest Tyler Perry's House of Pain to all of you guys who enjoyed this film; you'll see some high quality humor there on about the same level of this abhorrent abomination. ,negative
 OK normally I am fascinated by Z movies. Some of the actors directors writers etc. in those movies have a shred of talent. They want to get that talent out so unfortunately for them they have to associate with crappy people to make their films. But some Z films do have at least one thing that may be noteworthy about them. Not here. As soon as I saw it I thought...'Wow a Blade knock-off.' Believe me if this movie could have lived up to that label that would have made it a better movie. Instead I was subjected to some of the most horrible acting I have ever seen in my life. Master Kao was bad so bad that I believe some of my neurons in my brain exploded trying to comprehend his acting. I am still trying to make sense of his enunciation and why he would raise his voice in speaking certain words...to add dramatic effect I'm sure...but it was for no apparent reason. Simply mind boggling. Oh and then there is the black guy in the purple cape near the end of the movie. Purple cape guy fights the hero for about 30 seconds but he is so bad that it actually looked like he was scared of fighting. The main hero and the main villain did decent jobs. The main hero (Derek Washington) seemed like he actually knew martial arts. ,negative
 A rather lame teen slasher from Brisbane. While the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden. The problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown but if they were that devil-may-care it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable so they end up being neither really. In fact I only started enjoying the film when I started wishing for their death. One of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realise we wouldn't have a movie if they did but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldn't. Avoid. ,negative
 This movie really has nothing going for it. With the Reverend played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman complaining about his constipation and other toilet humor in a 2.5 hour movie you know that they made no cuts at all and left the crap in literally. It's a waste of good talent and a total embarrassment. Dreadful! ,negative
 A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director. My feelings about both films are in fact the same: beautifully shot but terribly slow and boring. I saw this film in a Sneak Preview and left after half an Hour. Couldn't stand it anymore. How can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are and how perfect their lives are.........? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I. still wandering around in the Vietnamese jungle who was not aware the war had ended. How he would suddenly pop up in the film and would start emptying his M16 at the characters in the movie. The red of their blood would make a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the film........... So I was not very much gripped by this film! Time to leave! ,negative
 I'm probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy Frisk the project that put Todd Verow on the map if that is indeed where he is. I appreciated that someone had the guts to take on Dennis Cooper and not back away from the material; Verow fairly rolls around in it. Judging from what he's done since then he's well-suited for that type of material and should probably stick to it. Vacationland a would-be teen coming out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and I'm disappointed I have to report that. First off our hero the high school Senior Joe is far too old in appearance to be playing 18 . When we later meet a man who is supposed to be Joe's teacher it's confusing as the sweaty-faced guy looks much younger than the student he's teaching. Joe's mother looks younger than he does and doesn't act any older either. Second in Joe's opening scenes he looked like he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges. To his credit he got better as the film went on and I figured out he was playing young but it just wasn't working--it was weird. It's 15 minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care. The second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a men's toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous; the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our young hero...one minute Joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex (a scene so un-erotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice) the next minute he's an expert at sexual blackmail and violent double-crossing. This is followed by an extended scene with the character we'll later learn is Andrew and that's about all we learn about him other than he's apparently gay but not out yet. There's a lot crammed in to the 1:44 running time (which is about 20 minutes too long--I can't imagine how it played with the mind-numbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of Joe walking around); a sub-plot copped from Gods And Monsters with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously can't remember his lines (he is conveniently dispatched with in a way Dickens might have come up with on a slow week); a mix-n-match almost-four-way between the boys and their girlfriends a gay-bashing toilet tramp a would-be wise sage in the form of a nellie queen (and hasn't the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired stereo-type?) who exists only to be degraded; blackmail theft murder alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recording. What you will NOT find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots; we're expected to imagine we're in an airport grocery store office and classroom as all the scenes in these locations consist of close-ups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford. One thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar; either it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in Bangor Maine as the bar never has any patrons in it. Another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasn't coming from the speakers but was just more of the droning loop-music of the score. Plots and characters come and go emotions are unreadable and the dialog clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper is film-speak meaning no humans actually talk this way. Since we aren't given any information about these characters it's impossible to care about what happens to them; it's as if Joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll (certainly the character of Joe's sister a wannabee Jennifer Grey who is Bohemia-crazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in LA or what her problem is...but again...does it matter?). Visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in hi-def video than anything I suspect. The editing is pretty clunky though (there was one great edit; Joe is posing naked and says I wanted to play sports but... and we cut to a shot revealing his butt... ha ha). Composition is also odd at times (I thought I was watching SCTV's parody of Persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scene!). One senses Verow is really restraining himself from making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldn't have held back (the frothy toothpaste/sex fantasy worked nicely I thought though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie)...he produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like Herschell Gordon Lewis directed films without gore...porn films without sex in them. I got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasn't boring it just wasn't very good either. ,negative
 Problems: 1) Although billed as a loving tribute to Poverty Row a lot of the old footage is not even from Poverty Row films-- much of it is from RKO's The Most Dangerous Game (1932) with some from the silent (!?) version of The Lost World (1926)! 2) Much of the old footage is just used as filler (the old shipboard footage) or as silent shots (for example of Bela walking looking or staring) often repeated; 3) Where is the pantheon of Poverty Row Master Thespians (Bela Boris Lon Chaney Jr. George Zucco John Carradine Buster Crabbe Tom Neal etc.) emoting their lines as punch lines to the 'new' characters jokes (as in Woody Allen's What's Up Tiger Lily? or Steve Martin's Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid )? Even Mike Nelson's feeble commentary on the colorized Reefer Madness is funnier than this. High Point: The long but extremely enlightening lecture by Gregory Mank which makes you give new respect to and admiration for Bela John Carradine and George Zucco. That's worth the price of the DVD alone! ,negative
 In The Ring it was a videotape; a website was the problem in Feardotcom; the danger in Pulse came from computers; and Phone and One Missed Call featuredyou guessed itdeadly phones. In Stay Alive the piece of technology that causes all manner of problems is an online game: those who play it wind up dead soon afterwards. How clever! Directed by William Brent Bell (who?) and featuring an unimpressive cast of twenty-somethings that you might have seen before but probably can't remember where or what the hell their names are this is an extremely derivative piece of film-making aimed squarely at the PG-13 horror set; seasoned scary film watchers will no doubt find Stay Alive extremely tedious highly predictable and not in the least bit frightening. The poorly developed plot follows a group of gamers with extremely daft names (October Loomis Phineus Hutch and Swink!?!) who attempt to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before they too become victims. Eventually they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory who is killing anyone who dares to play and that their only hope of survival is to continue with the game to the end. With a story as dumb as this viewers should expect a film with loose ends aplenty not one iota of logic (who made the game how and why is never explained) very little in the way of scares or gore and a dumb closing scene to leave the door open forGod forbida sequel. ,negative
 This film SUCKS!! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. Good gore but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. I figured that she had PMS. It sure seemed that way. The dubbing in this film is horrible. One scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the US. I tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe even for a horror film. Some good characters but not many. Not worth wasting one's time. ,negative
 Nothing Carson Daly has EVER said or done on this show has EVER made me laugh or even smile a little. I DO NOT understand how this show has survived for so many years. Even the funny band member is just like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to even look at him. Daly and that dude are just arrogant frat boys. It seems like they don't even try to be a little funny. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL show. It makes my soul cry. I just cannot stress enough how AWFUL this show is. Don't watch it. But if you absolutely have to I recommend clawing your eyes out and clogging your ears with cement beforehand. ,negative
 While Star Trek the Motion Picture was mostly boring Star Trek The Final Frontier is plain bad. In this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the Federation that ambassadors representing Earth Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. There he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing he persuades many of the senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and get a hold of the ship. They do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. This one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. At the core is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. It is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes don't have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him Spock and McCoy but does not give the others enough to do. Moreover whereas Shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one. Now Kirk is reckless a practical jokers and silly. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song Row Row Row your Boat in a round by a campfire. In any case this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given it three out of ten instead of five. ,negative
 Ah yes it's yet another retelling of the classic sociopathic murderous doctor creates female Frankenstein and falls in love . From the same director who brought you such timeless classics as 10 000 Maniacs (no not the group) and Blood Feast this unfinished film virtually cries out for the MST3K treatment. The doctor's assistant even has overtones of Torgo from the classic Manos: The Hands Of Fate . I don't know if the graphic if fake-looking violence or the frequent stretches of dialogue-free tedium could have scared the crew off though. The main reasons to bother sitting through this movie are for the hysterical 'hypnosis' scene the laughably serious ending and the rock-bottom production values. I actually watched all of the credits after this movie for the same reasons you're inclined to slow down your car when you pass a serious traffic accident. That and the sheer genius of the end theme that sounds like a watered down My Favorite Things played on a toy piano. Goblin this ain't. ,negative
 I'll dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies. They are too numerous to name. A much shorter list would be what they got right. 1. Dude named Noah. 2. Ark with animals on it. If you want a much more accurate portrayal of Noah's Ark and the destruction of Sodom go rent The Bible (1966). It depicts the story of creation through Abraham attempting to sacrifice his son Isaac. It's a much better movie and it may be that the abomination called Noah's Ark (1999) drove you to seek just such a film. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ I really couldn't stomach watching the whole movie. From reading other comments I can see that even the atheists found it grossly inaccurate. As a Christian it was intolerable to me. Possibly the worst movie ever made. No real point to this movie either except maybe to showcase their sub-par computer animation. Was it a complete waste? Maybe not. God can use evil to work good. Romans 8:28 says [28] And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose. Genesis 50 says [20] But as for you ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive. In the second example Joseph's brothers meant to kill him but God turned their evil into a very great good. He may have done the same thing with this movie. People were so astonished by its lack of Biblical foundation that they probably broke out the dusty old Bible and read the story for themselves. To find out about Lot and Sodom they would have to go the whole way up to Genesis 19 before God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. By then they have read almost half of Genesis so they might want to finish. The next book is Exodus which the movie The Ten Commandments was based on (and much more accurately). If they have seen that movie then Exodus becomes an easy read. So now they have read at least two whole books of the Bible just because they watched a pathetic movie about Noah's Ark. I'm sure this actually happened to someone out there. God works in mysterious ways. ,negative
 I caught this on HBO under its category of Guilty Pleasures and I would agree that I felt guilty (and pleasured) watching it. One it's trash and really raunchy trash. Two the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn who did it you think So what? . However I must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie if for no other reason than to see Peta Wilson get completely naked a number of times. Do I feel dirty for having watched it? Yes. Am I sorry I watched it? No. So there's the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female anatomy even when in a poor movie. Sigh! ,negative
 OK yes I know I'm a Philistine and I have no knowledge of nor love for opera. I readily admit that I might feel differently about this film if I did. But I don't. So for those of you like me skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty (sometimes unclothed) girls. For what it's worth I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (who I didn't recognize) was the best of the lot. ,negative
 The story is disjointed and poorly written. We are given threads and a possible hook in act one only to see it vanish. Had the writer bothered reading his work carefully it wold have been apparent that Madsden's character's initial problem and meeting with the 'bad' girl suggests that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problem. The problem goes nowhere. The relationship goes nowhere. And there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. No-one digs anyone and no-one is appealing. The writing and directing is laughable. You can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the story focus about trying to extract some excitement. There is none. The writer/director is simply a beginner whose muddled efforts somehow became a movie. From simple errors such as '...they took polaroids...' - in Japan in 2007 ? to insulting errors such as nudity for eroticism this movie is an insult. You cannot make them much worse. And by plastering 'Madsden' on the talent list the producers thought they'd have some success. He is hardly acting. Asia certainly is... and the result is some heroin-chic panto. Give it a big miss. ,negative
 I get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie (not all people but a lot of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. People of middling intelligence if you will who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think Lynch is a genius. Lynch to me is like Tarantino. They're both great but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe. No director can change the world so chill out. And both make sucky flicks sometimes it just happens. Everyone has a bad day. And clearly since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack-jobbed into a feature film it wasn't made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie. Face it much of the movie is gibbering unintelligibility which cannot be understood. We can all make up meanings Lynch may have his own view but none of that matters. It was strewn about the screen incoherently. Admittedly the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted passingly interesting story but then it falters. The cowboy the mysterious organization of men with their phonecalls the lawyers... come on. I can almost picture David Lynch yelling cut forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all Look how crazy and weird I am! Isn't it great?? It's so weird and crazy! Weird and crazy works if it's a by-product of your style. However it's pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that. It's like all those half assed Pulp Fiction throw backs that came out after Pulp Fiction. It's just not cool. ,negative
 OK so it's a silly movie but I think they knew that when they made it. And there are some neat little twists on the otherwise tired overdone Godzilla -type genre. Borrowed a tape just because I knew someone in it but I did loan it out to a couple pals who also kinda liked it. ,negative
 OK this movie was the worst display I have seen in years. The actors weren't to bad (I figured it was a b-movie so they were doing b-movie acting). Anyways I watched this movie thinking OH COOL a UFO Sci-Fi movie. WRONG. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to push a message onto people. The last scene was extremely messed up. That is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something. What someone believe in is a matter of opinion. This movie just shows how corrupted religion is especially Christianity. If you want to watch a b-movie this ain't. If you want to watch a movie that is TRYING to brainwash the masses. Well this is the pick of the litter. go right for it. If you are going to convey a message do it don't force it. Ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such a degree. Especially Christians. ,negative
 The concept: show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax District of L.A. preparing for the family get-together at Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and How to Make an American Quilt {I think there's a law that Alfre Woodard has to be in all these movies) which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions and was prepared for a treat. Instead I felt tricked. They trot out about 40+ characters and all but two are one-note cliches with no finesse whatsoever. The writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate. Instead you have a bunch of a**holes getting together on Turkey Day to act like extra-obnoxious a**holes. Now to an extent this is what Thanksgiving is all about. But not this misguidedly. And why bother having Julianne Marguiles then giving her absolutely nothing to do. This was a chore to get through and Mercedes Ruehl is a standout but I give it a 4/10. ,negative
 I watched this film in the theater in Edinbourgh along with 3 other Americans and our friend from Manchester and we all thought this was a waste of time. We would have much rather spent an extra hour to watch vapid dialog of Star wars III that was playing down the hall than all of this. Opening with one of the worst jokes I've ever seen committed to celluloid on the big screen it did not take off with a bang. throughout the movie we got the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard the writers thought about the setup so much that you could see the joke coming 2 minutes beforehand then when it came it was so lackluster that you couldn't even smile; I cite the giraffe cum-ming as a prime example. The plot itself makes for some interesting thoughts in my mind which entertained me much more than what was going on on the screen. I think a lot more could have been done with that angle (the two different worlds the fish-out-of-water experience of the characters the confusion and surprise as people try to comprehend and distinguish the characters and writers from each other.) But too much time is wasted with pushing this painful plot to the end with as much 'bizarre' and 'goof' as is humanly possible. And to say the 16th century characters show any extra talent from the writers is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who possibly could have made this film a worthy 40 minute afterthought; but no its a full length torture film of unfunniness. As we were leaving the theater which had VERY little laughing inside it I overheard the young hip electro-clash British couple behind me saying That was rather good wasn't it. You never really knew what was coming next. And the girl responding yeah quite surprising. and that was it. If this is what is meant to get out of British people from watching a comedy: no laughing for 90 minutes but a teeny bit of communication between two lovers at the end then this film succeeded. But i have more belief in British life than that. I've not not-laughed so hard at a comedy film since American Pie II. ,negative
 I as a Christian am outraged after seeing just the first half of this picture. The film's website says they researched the movie before writing but I believe they forgot to consult the ultimate source THE BIBLE. I sat with two different versions of the Bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture. It was like they made up what was not in the Bible and changed what was in the Bible to what they thought modern film viewers would want to see instead of the truth. I personally am too young to remember the 1950's Ten Commandments but it can't be any worse than this. I have written to the network and can only hope they publicly apologize for this travesty. ,negative
 I have spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and most recently find myself working for the company that made this movie which is a REAL pity because I like these folks I just can't believe ANYONE could possibly make anything as bad as this?!!!! This was crap from every possible angle. From camera work to dialogue to acting to costumes and production design was one of the worst films I have ever seen! The actors in this film looked like they had been taken straight off of a porn that was being shot in the San Fernando Valley and put on a set with an even less talented crew. I just can't get over the fact that I am sitting on some of the best material I have ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have hit every roadblock possible? Yet the folks behind this spectacle of a film have no problems putting it together and in fact sleep well after it is released. Life what a trip! ,negative
 The movie was supposed to release in 2002 and was much awaited due to the promos but it finally released in 2003 after the producer died The movie is good in parts but overall isn't great The scenes between Rani and Ajay are okay but the other scenes are not well handled The film is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so originality is lost Milan Luthria disappoints overall after KACHCHE DAAGE Music is good but too many songs Ajay Devgan looks jaded and his appearance gives away that the film was delayed and his acting looks boring too Rani is good Sonali is good too rest are okay ,negative
 Miles O'keefe stars as Ator a loin-clothed hero who resembles a Chippendale's dancer. The Conan-wannabe must do battle with an evil guy in a Cher wig and protect the Earth from the Geometric Nucleus a sort of primitive atomic bomb. Watch closely for visible sunglasses and tire-tracks. Mystery Science Theater 3000 made fun of it under the title CAVE DWELLERS. ,negative
 My first question is NOT about the horrible acting NOT about the horrendous writing it is the directing. The choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions I have ever seen. Why does EVERY single bad guy have to die in slow motion? I was about to beat myself with a rubber hose. The camera shots make it so that you can't see whats going on. I was JUST about to turn the movie off because of Jalal Merhi's accent when it made it to the sex scene so I thought it might get better well it did not. If you rate special effects on an A B C rating scale I would have to put it around a W or so and did I mention the acting? Wow was it bad!!! And the WORST part of the entire Expect to DIE experience is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover which is: THE MATRIX JUST GOT DEADLIER . comparing this movie to the Matrix is easily the WORST comparison I have EVER seen. If you haven't seen this movie Don't unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall. ,negative
 Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films. I am looking for all his films to see. I could not find this one for 3 year until I unexpectedly found it in youtube. To tell the truth I wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here. It looks like in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis maybe in money. His features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. But I do not claim him to be a bad director this time . Everything happens. The ending has some nice creepy details and suspense but the whole film was long dull dialogues . only for real Ted's fans. www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab ,negative
 28 years before 9/11 there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace. Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history. The times were troubled and Allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world. True he was democratically elected but his policies plunged Chile into economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution. We'll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded. The authors of the movie take a completely pro-Allende position there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by Castro. The tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic almost propagandistic. People who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future. ,negative
 Wow. As soon as I saw this movie's cover I immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood movies just because they're so bad that it will be entertaining (eg. Koi Mil Gaya). This movie had all the elements of an atrocious film: a gang of local thugs that is completely harmless a poorly done motorcycle scene horrible dialouge ( Congrats son I am very proud that you are a Bad Boy ) actors playing basketball as if they are good atrocious songs ( Me bad me bad me bad bad boy ) unexplained plot lines like why are the Good Boy and Bad Boy friends??? And why is the hot girl in love with the nerd?? I've never seen such a poorly constructed story with such horrible directly. Some of the scenes actually took 30 seconds long like the one where the Good and Bad Boys inexplicably ran over the gang member's poker game. Congrats Ashwini Chaudry you are a Bad Director. If you want to watch a good movie watch Guru if you want to watch a movie so bad that it's actually entertaining then watch Good Boy Boy. ,negative
 They do... Each sequel is worst. You who think that Ghoulies 2 or 3 need a 1 please watch this sequel... You'll be wondering with the first three parts. Then you'll give a 10 to the first 8 to the second and 5 or 6 to the other. That's because Ghoulies 4 really gets the big 1 (from me it does). ,negative
 In watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae. I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this reality show competition. No other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women shouldn't watch this teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject. Many women try out for slots to compete for Americas Next Top Model . They live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim You will see me again . Heck I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win actually. This is the dream of some girls and good for them. In watching this I hope the other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way - like to college. I just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group. That even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks. The full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a ploy fashionatas use all the time. Bad bad Tyra and crew. But to be fair Americas Next Top Model is not about full figured models it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations. Hence Tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get. But then again that IS the one thing I like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldn't have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors. But after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program. ,negative
 I loved the first movie the second one was okay disappointed John Cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. But the third one...what happened to the animation??? it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after number 2 this just makes the rest look bad!! Derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob..Rogers also looks very strange. I also don't understand where Rothbart came from. I thought he died! This movie made me want to turn it off as much as i love the first one i was very disappointed with this installment. They will never beat the original!:) ,negative
 From what I understand Fox was embarrassed they released a PG-13 Alien/Predator movie not so long ago. It was not well received by any means. Not exactly sure where to go next seeing as they thought Anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci-fi gem Fox turned to it's small but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers. These monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks but had seen Burton's Planet of the Apes remake and House of the Dead. Their first task: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen TV actors shortly after. Now the script. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. Leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. They butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award-winning screenplay equipped with cliché characters idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes. Fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film - the aliens and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible AvP original and go with the man-in-the-suit Alien seen in the old films. The actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the predators the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around (again saving budget) to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere. But what about the effects you ask? Come on now people. They may be monkeys but they clearly knew CGI would play a key role in the film. Without diving into the budget the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. Putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent Predator visions. The setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. If this was to be on Earth in Colorado of all places they needed to make it realistic. This was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. See the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. To add insult to injury the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again rookie mistake. The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie R-rated. That was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence. Some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. Why does a blue liquid the Predator has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? Why is an ex-convict driving around in a police car the entire movie? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the Aliens? Why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. Fox was thrilled with their work. So thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on Christmas Day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises. But some ask what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? They put it towards their next film: Aliens vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan. They knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement: To the people- do not worry about our upcoming film. It will be rated R and will have violence. And everyone lived happily ever after. The end. ,negative
 It is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting. It happens quite often. Not only is Dark Harbor uninteresting but it is very poorly done. Scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise. A troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more trouble. Some movies build tension by building the story. Dark Harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it. I was hoping that like other movies the suspense would finally explode. It never does. Also the characters have no continuity from scene to scene. They may act one way in one scene but then act a completely different way in another scene. At first you think that they are merely out of character but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all. They are just props for the final twist. The final ten minutes try to be shocking. Instead it's rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended. At less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too long. This isn't one of those low-budget gems. It's more like a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you take it home. ,negative
 When you're used to Lana Turner in the Postman Always Rings Twice and compare it to this low budget low talent low quality film well I was just embarrassed for Ida Lupino's 'singing' (more like talking) and non-piano playing scenes. When the first non-singing scene started and all the people just stared flatly at her I was positive they were all going to roll their eyes and start leaving or at least talking among themselves (She stinks c'mon let's get out of here). The actors are flat - emotions are deflated. And Ida is a real spoiled bi-otch throughout - just a 100% turnoff. This was like Betty Boop on conscious sedation meets a gas station attendant in nowhere's ville USA. The story was flat the music was flat the acting was flat her chest was... no never mind. I felt sad for the rest of the actors. Perhaps if the right actress was to have been given the lead role and the men actors had more emotion then the film could have had a chance. Sorry for offending those of you who thought it was out of this world. I wouldn't have minded if it stayed out of this world. ,negative
 IS there any reason to revive characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they worked the first time was due to the actors playing them. Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz -- or better yet who can replace them at cut-rate prices since most studios know that sequels don't bring in the same amount of revenue as the originals so they cut corners from the get-go. Where are the good movies going to play if powerful Hollywood studios can clog up 3 000 theaters opening weekend with whatever turds they feel like the general public can be suckered into. Enough's enough people this sequel-itis has got to stop and the Hollywood people need to start getting their act together or start distributing the much-better foreign product that's floating in limbo. Wake up Hollywood cause the people HAVE woken up and they aren't buying it just cause it's new and shiny. Give us the good stuff and send the rest to the DVD shelves cause we are taking back the theaters once and for all!!! ,negative
 Now infamous Western that was (at its time) the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history. I was lucky enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990. It was truly staggering how BAD the film was! They had a great cast a story based on a true incident (a fight between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s) magnificent scenery...so what went wrong? Three words--director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after The Deer Hunter he went out and made this god awful Western. He's not totally to blame. His previous film The Deer Hunter was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free reign to do anything. They let him all alone...and everything went wrong. The cost went barreling out of control and Cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfect. First off the sound is horrible. Entire sequences go by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying. For instance Jeff Bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence but I STILL have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! That's the director's fault--he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out what's going on. The story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts--in the real story only one person was killed--Cimino turns it into a massacre. There is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre--all the prints sound that way. This garbage effectively closed down United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing. Jeff Bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did. This is from a guy who made Tron ! A definite must-miss. There is a pretty good book called The Final Cut which details the whole disaster. This gets a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbers--this deserves it! ,negative
 This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I have ever seen! I am giving this movie way too much credit! My best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else's martial arts abilities but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it so he put a story behind the fighting... and people still didn't watch it. This movie's story line was onion skin thin. That acting was goofy and stereotypical of any Kung Fu movie. The dubbing was literally the worst I have ever heard. It seemed if you played a small role in this movie like the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net it didn't matter who over did your voice. It could have been a dyslexic with a slurred stutter and nobody would have said anything. But beside all of this the movie makes up for itself with the somewhat awesome fight scenes. The fight scenes were definitely what this movie was all about. But the instigations of the fights were totally absurd! On most all instances a guy either pops out of the tall grass or glances at the main character from a distance and then attacks him. But once the fighting started things sort of balanced out. There were only two things that really hampered the fighting though. Those constant wooshing sound effects that were added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword and the poor editing that made 25 percent of the fighting VERY jumpy and choppy. Someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly be on the ground being kicked and then instantly be back on their feet blocking a punch. But while the cut and paste editing was more of a nuisance than anything else it didn't really affect the overall movie. In the end this was not a great movie but I wasn't expecting a great movie. A great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movie's. All I saw this movie as was a way to pass an hour and a half of boredom. I rarely say that but this was just one of those movies you have no practical use for so you watch it whenever you have some free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good day gentlemen. -Scott- ,negative
 This show should be titled When Bad Writing Happens To Good Actors considering most of the players have demonstrated immense talent in other venues e.g. Andre Braugher in Homicide: Life on the Street and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I'm hoping that the frenetic pacing of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd I wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be. We're beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of avenging angel sentenced to redeem himself from sins both venial and mortal via butting into his cab fares many affairs. Watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief that Mike Olshanskey's fares would so rapidly spill their guts and he would feel driven to intervene in the lives of utter strangers. That he possesses those Super-Cop abilities to be all things to all people weapons expert martial arts master psychologist father-confessor locksmith and so on ad infinitum. Pure drivelesque fantasy. What is it about recent televisions shows based in Philidelphia that they all seem to be imbued with a nasty ex-wife and a very disrepectfully bratty child? Overdone. I wanted to like this show really I did because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different than many of the clones appearing in this season's fare and it stars some of my preferred actors. But I'm afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by careless execution. ,negative
 Even not being a fan of the Star Trek movies or universe of shows and books and such I still find some enjoyment in some of the movies featuring the old cast and in the case of First Contact even the new cast a bit. This one though was kind of sad to watch...it seemed to want to be so much but it failed on so many levels to be one of the worst Star Trek movies. The plot is very far fetched seeming to want to combine three or four stories into one ultimate Trek adventure but it ends up an unfunny when it tries to be not tense when it wants to be and not action packed like it tries to be mess of inconsistencies. The whole movie to take a phrase from Spock is illogical. The effects are nothing special as I have seen episodes of Next Generation that are just as good which is to say it is fine for a television show but not a major motion picture. The plot is laughable as the gang at first tries to stop Spock's brother then joins him on his quest to find God yes you read that correctly. The Klingons make a tacked on appearance which actually will set up the much better Undiscovered Country movie. All in all you know it is bad when the best part of the film is Kirk Bones and Spock singing row your boat well Spock was not really singing but rather questioning the lyrics. ,negative
 Return to Frogtown was a hard film to track down. Well I accomplished that mission and it had been sitting on the shelf for a good while. Wish it was kept that way! First Sam Hell is of course not Roddy Piper. He is replaced by a dude with a large face less charisma and this poor actor is very soft-spoken for the part! Sam Hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome. Here he gets captured THREE times! What kind of a hero is that?! Spangle is replaced as well here by another actress. Why did we not get different characters here? This was stupid! Lou Ferrigno stars in this film and he is not even the hero. Common sense says let Lou be the hero of the film! Bad effects poor acting and just a forgettable film. Funny as they take shots at Ninja Turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! I really wanted to like Return to Frogtown but I just cringed when the fight scenes would commence. This film makes Turtles 3 look like gold! Avoid this or you will be the one singing meaner greener talking turtle TV dinner!  ,negative
 Based on a Stephen King novel NEEDFUL THINGS provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your seat. A mysterious man(Max von Sydow) comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen. Could it be that the devil himself has set up shop as an antique dealer in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. Also starring are Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is steady and Bedelia is deserving of your attention. Also in support are J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best nor the worst adaptation of King's horror on the screen. ,negative
 Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent who prevents the assassination of a senator however along the way he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker on his tail. The tracker by the way is bent on terminating Phillips. The most obvious inspiration for this low budget cheeseball action flick is of course Robocop and while that film had some imagination and real energy this just has a real life kickboxing champ running away from a robot. The movie isn't so awful as it is just empty and repetitive. The story is written in clichés and the characters are set up to be cut down by the various gunfire. Don Wilson as usual is terrible in the lead role. *1/2 out of 4-(Poor) ,negative
 My wife and I never got into the movie.We thought it was way to sloooowwww and to many subtitles.I understood they needed them for Vietnam but took to long to get out of Asia.She wanted it off I said it's going to get better.It never did yes they had a tough time trying to get to America but I wanted to see him looking and finding his dad.Not at the end but forming a relationship.Did I mention it was slllloooowwwwww.I love to watch a movie to feel good not sad at the end.I know they don't make many good movies now days.I think action movies are the only ones to watch.I have been renting a lot from netflix and now blockbuster maybe 20% are worth seeing.I don't kneed realism or facts just a movie thats fun and makes you feel good.Gary ,negative
 This is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. The three main cast members just didn't seem to click well. Giovanni Ribisi's character was quite annoying. For some reason he seems to like repeating what he says. If he was the Rain Man it would've been fine but he's not. 3 out of 10. ,negative
 One night on an independent channel famous for showing off-the-wall films was aired this monstrosity. Though tempted to turn it off we watched it to the bitter end hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value. Alas there was none. Absolutely nothing. The film quality was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the editing was ridiculous. Then again there was precious little to salvage. After a few minutes of Cameron Mitchell's doctor character narrating about some patient of his the viewer is tortured by no plot pathetic writing abysmally terrible acting and an utter lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotting cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrendous special effects and makeup to ever disgrace the screen even for television. The main character stumbles through his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwashing gloves which appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled in beads. Perhaps the poor lighting and gag-worthy film quality were attempting to cover up how bad-to-the-tenth-power the makeup was. One can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video. Seriously a handful of three-year-old kids could've produced a better project. At the end poor Mr. Mitchell returns (how desperate he must've been for money!) and drones out some nonsense that's supposed to connect this pile of crap with the AIDS epidemic. Please spare you and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. It was so bad even Mystery Science Theater 3000 couldn't have salvaged it. ,negative
 After the success of Star Wars there was a boost in interest in Sci-Fi movies. This was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly. A group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs where half of them are systematically killed off (the people not the dinosaurs). Porn-movie level acting. Cheap special effects even for the time although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them. Costumes were pure 1970's as were the hairstyles. Ahh the 70's. I expected a disco to break out at any minute. Nothing to really recommend in this film. ,negative
 This was shown on a premium channel so I didn't realise it was made for TV. Even so I like some of the movies on lifetime (Lifestyle here in UK) but this was awful. The family were so cheesy Love you mum Love you even more honey Then after they were broken into for the second time 10 mins later they were at it again Love you mum big cheesy smiles etc... She phones her husband and tells him not to bother coming home. They were only broken into by a guy that wanted them dead have a nutter living next door who needs help? She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not for long) to look after her. However as a comedy I'd give it a good 7. I might even show it to my friends next time I have them round. Could be great fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10! ,negative
 I thought the movie was sub-par. The acting was good but not great the story was funny but did not come out that way. The director dropped the ball on this movie. It was not James (jim) or Tea. IMHO it was the music that killed it. There is a scene where things go down hill and Jonny Cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. After that the movie could not recover. The deportation scene had potential funny situation good acting good set up - I even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene. The music kept me from being pulled in to the movie. I say it had potential but was poorly done i would even say rushed into final production. Kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist: the beginning. The theater release was good I though so after watching it but the movie release exorcist:dominion was a helluva lot better. Same story just different director. Same should be done here. ,negative
 I haven't seen many movies worse than this one. The story line the dialogues the acting: it's horror! The story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between. Every time you think you've missed something but no: that was the way it was intended to be. And why on earth is the character that Jenny Garth portrays so in love with that no-no loser guy (who actually now plays in the movie Cinderella Man with Russel Crow!)? O well it's no Spielberg of course... I have to write ten lines to get posted. This movie really isn't inspiring enough to write 10 lines! It's a romantic feel good movie with a lousy story so if you're up for that: you'll have a ball. ,negative
 I'm sorry folks but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie Respiro are very strange to say the least. Is craziness picturesque I ask and didn't find an answer. Of course the movie is beautifully filmed at part it's almost a documentary. But then the fact is that when it comes to the women Grazia she shows every sign of a deep illness and I was wondering throughout the movie what the heck she has. Her behavior is absolutely worrisome and the (shocked) citizens of the village are very right indeed in wanting to send her off to a proper institution to see what can be done about her condition. She needs treatment urgently! Behaviour like hers is inferno to everybody around her her husband the poor children (especially) and the fellow citizens. Let's not be falsely romantic about this! I hated this condoning portrait of a mentally ill. WHY for God's sake should the husband not want to have her cured or at least try to do this? Why the horror of going to Milan (a big city sure but lots of possibilities of capable persons to cure her)? Narrowmindedness? Irresponsibility? Anyway I inspired myself on this site for renting the movie on DVD and after seeing it I HAD to post this for others to make themselves an opinion on it. Frankly I understand why the movie did not get any further as an INDICATION to the Cannes selection... ,negative
 This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. No story no point it wasn't even funny at all not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucked SO much!! Felix Bean the main character sucked. Susanna sucked. This movie was made in 1996 and it really was set in the 80s. What else I'm never letting my friend pick movies ever again. Hmm the movie cover said it was from the producers from super troopers who kidnapped them and stole their identities. Wow what a waste of time. The only minute thing that was funny was Freaky Ricky he was funny especially when he and Emily ended up together. That was funny. All and all it sucked waste of time and sleep. Wow never thought a movie like this could be made so dumb for watching for watching it to the end. ,negative
 This movie sucked sooo bad I couldn't even watch the ending. Milo's voice was too low and I couldn't understand what he said as well as some of Kendra's lines. Also where did he get all these wedding dresses from; it was very impractical. The movie failed to elaborate on Milo's drowning and how it made people ridicule Dr. Jeter and his practice. Overall I was disappointed that I was unable to give this movie a rating of zero because by grading this movie as a one I felt I was giving it undeserved praise. ,negative
 The best part of this DVD is the cover. It goes down hill from there. There was no chemistry between the leads the kisses looked like something I traded with my grandmother. The sound was so bad that at least I was spared some of the dialoge. ,negative
 Wow I swear this has never happened to me before. I only watched Golden Temple Amazons yesterday and already I haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. That's how brilliant this movie is I guess! By now I only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. I often get fooled by appealing DVD covers  especially Jess Franco ones  and I still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences. Oh well After reading the other user-comments some parts of my memory returned although I still suspect to confuse this film with another Jess Franco masterpiece I watched the day before namely Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro (and yes that one had an awesome DVD cover as well). Golden Temple Amazons opens with a posse of hot white African Amazons  I am aware of the contradiction but don't blame me  slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. Several years and hormonal changes later the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge. She's accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldn't mind taking some gold back home. The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze. Analía Ivars Eva Léon and the other nameless Amazons are all regular Franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed. You better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves as the rest of Golden Temple Amazons is a boring and incompetent mess. There's hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler bits and pieces of National Geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff. The awesome DVD cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection but opening the box is utter pointless. ,negative
 This movie was unbelievably bad... It's gory but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable. Since Everything is shown to you there is nothing left to the imagination. And the plot... what plot? There really isn't any! The pacing is unbelievably slow (despite the random acts of violence) and the screenplay must have been written by a deranged 12 year old kid who kills kittens for fun. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I could see why... not because of the gore (boring and trite) but because it was a terrible movie. It should have been BANNED from existence. Avoid this one like the plague. 1 out of 10 ,negative
 The spoof genre which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already gets spat upon yet again by hacks with no talent. No point no fun no originality; just a few cheap bucks for the film makers. It takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters double-meaning names to be satire; to make people laugh. Any clod can pick up a cam-corder and have some bad-acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody. Since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type: the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways to get you to laugh hysterically. It doesn't work. That's not comedy. However the same old worn out sophomoric jokes ripped off from a middle school washroom (done even more blandly than usual) are all here. If that's not enough there's a running gag of a bus running somebody over. So funny right? Also one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than Michael Bay; again with the same unfunny results. A musical bit flops miserably. Pity Carl Weathers once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series now stuck with roles in swill like this. Lousy beyond words. Watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is. Probably a lot funnier too. ,negative
 What an atomic bomb of a movie. The story goes nowhere and comes fron nowhere. It leaves the theatre goer with ones arm up saying is this it . What happened to Redford. He was once a fair actor. Now he thinks that he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it's a take. Wrong. What an unemotional film. I don't mean to be so so cruel but what crap of a movie. Unbelievable amateur crap. If I was in this movie I would be so embarased that I would not show my face. I tell you what if I was associated with this movie I am in big trouble. This movie will go down in the annals of movie making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared to. ,negative
 It was (foolishly) with some degree of relish that I sat down to watch what a friend had promised would be the worst/best movie experience of my life the mighty 'Roller blade 7'. 2 years on and I'm still in therapy. Oh yes my dear friends it REALLY IS THAT BAD. They obviously got about 40 minutes of footage in the can and then decided to use said footage endlessly and repeatedly to brain-numbing effect. My only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world featured in this turkey is that somehow some way a print of this abomination would survive. Truly the living would envy the dead. ,negative
 Super Troopers was an instant classic. Club Dread while disappointing to many had its moments. Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was made by the Broken Lizard group who made Super Troopers so naturally I picked it up. I only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny. A far cry from Super Troopers. All in all I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you have an abundance of free time and really need to kill some time. However you're better off playing video games or watching something that might make you laugh or think. ,negative
 May Contain Spoilers. An innocent trailer park or maybe 'Compton' LA white kid witnesses a terrible childhood tragedy relating to drugs and violence. An unprofessional but dedicated police partners try to take down a 'sophisticated' high end club drug ring only to be fired and chewed out by the the drug lords high priced attorneys. The plot thickens as more people come back to seek vengeance and justice with a predictable ending. The only memorable part was a walk-on by Ron Jeremy. If I was in a movie theater I would have asked for a refund. I feel sorry for the poor actors in this movie. It was just awful and painful to watch. The worst part was the cinematography were the director kept flashing back within the same scene so the sound would not quite match. And NO it was not a codec nor DVD problem but an intentional technique. Ughh. Two Stars. ,negative
 The Concorde ... Airport '79 starts in Washington where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCalman) contacts high profile TV news reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) in order to hand secret documents over that prove his boss Kevin Harriosn (Robert Wagner) owner & president of Harrison Industries that develop weapons for the military has been illegally selling said weapons to foreign countries. However Maggie sees Carl assassinated & she barely escapes with her life Maggie is to catch the Concorde to Moscow via Paris the next morning & intends to blow the whistle on Harrison who also happens to be her boyfriend which would ruin him. Determined to save himself he reprogrammes his hi-tech 'Buzzard' homing missile to intercept & destroy the Concorde during a test run killing all those on-board & destroying the documented evidence... Renamed Airport '80 - The Concorde for it's cinema & initial home video releases because it was released here in well 1980 rather than 1979 this last entry in the Airport franchise was directed by David Lowell Rich & is a notoriously bad film that was apparently laughed at during press & test screenings prompting Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that The Concorde ... Airport '79 is a really silly & downright daft film but on a purely entertainment basis I can think of a lot worse films to spend 108 minutes watching I really can. I quite liked the absurd plot about a wealthy industrialist wanting to kill his girlfriend TV reporter before she can expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy doesn't do subtle & decides the best way to do it is to blow Concorde up with his own guided missile & then gets a Fench fighter pilot to try & shoot it down before finally sabotaging it so really there's three mini disaster flicks in one here as each time super pilot Joe Patroni manages to save the day. You know Joe Patroni played by George Kennedy appears in all four Airport films & goes from mechanic in the first to Concorde pilot extrodinaire in this also I reckon he's a bit of a jinx since in the space of nine years he has been involved with four major aviation disasters. I think the real reason why the Airport series stopped here was because Patroni retired after this & the jinx was lifted. Some of the things that happen here are just silly Patroni does barrel rolls flies upside-down & out manoeuvre's a guided missile in a huge Concorde not to mention he crash lands it & fires flare guns out of his window to destroy the missile all while keeping a calm head. This guy is good very good. Then there's the character's there's a Saxophone playing black dude who smokes weed in the toilets an old woman with a bladder problem & a team of Russian gymnasts with bad accents. Also despite being almost shot down with a missile & then attacked by a Jet fighter the passengers of Concorde don't seem that bothered & happily get back aboard the following day I don't know about you but after that I would probably find a safer way to travel & why do the police or authorities not question anyone? Why is the Concorde captain Patroni allowed to just go off & sleep with a French prostitute? The Concorde ... Airport '79 certainly isn't boring & is full of memorable moments & I was entertained in a way although it's far from a good film & modern audiences may not have the patience with it hell I liked it for what it was in a daft way but it's no sort of classic. Even though Concorde no longer flies it's still quite a cool looking air-plane & there's plenty of footage of it here the one used in The Concorde ... Airport '79 was the seventh one built. This Concorde was also the same aircraft which crashed after a tire bust caused a fuel tank to rupture and the leaking fuel catch fire on July 25th 2000 while taking off in Paris sadly resulting in the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground. When this aired on TV in the US in 1982 almost twenty minutes of new footage was included with most if not all of it being newly shot over two years after the original production had finished. I know the effects here take a bashing from most but I don't reckon they are too bad when you consider this was made in the late 70's I think they come across quite well. The camera moves during effects shots real footage of real planes is used rather than toy models which in my opinion would have looked a lot worse & I could certainly see what the makers were trying to do with limited funds & limited technology. In a strange way they are quite impressive actually without ever looking that good if you know what I mean. Probably the most action packed of all the Airport films there's missiles exploding planes daring crash landings assassinations & a guy named Robert Palmer (no not the singer) giving head a woman in a jacuzzi. The IMDb says this had a budget of about $14 000 000 which is actually more than I thought maybe those special effects aren't so impressive after all. Shot in Utah Washington Los Angeles & France. The acting isn't great here people don't look worried enough that they are about to die. Goerge Kennedy gets some bad one-liners while Robert Wagner plays the bad guy. The Concorde ... Airport '79 is fun for bad film enthusiasts everywhere & to be brutally honest I rather watch this entertaining mess of a film than some two hour Oscar nominated bore. ,negative
 Screenwriter Steve Tesich's sophomore effort (following upon the wildly overpraised BREAKING AWAY) is a compendium of clichés coincidence and dour melodrama. Perhaps he lived some of this; if so I'm sorry to say he was inexplicably unable to dramatize any of it convincingly. In fairness he's not helped much here by Arthur Penn a talented director who's done remarkable work in the past (BONNIE AND CLYDE LITTLE BIG MAN) but fails to inject any energy or verisimilitude into Tesich's narrative. The cast struggles as best they can but are saddled with weak motivation and dialogue. Sympathies should be reserved particularly for Craig Wasson whose morose performance presages the impending quick fade of his leading man career as well as the embarrassingly untethered Jodi Thelen miscast as the film's extremely unlikely 'femme fatale.' It all seems longer than it is and any points made are heavy-handed and obvious. See Arthur Penn's earlier take on the subject of the 60's the droll and elegiac ALICE'S RESTAURANT; it's everything this one isn't. ,negative
 bad acting combats are very awful 3-4 second between each text bad music bad effect and always the same plan during the movie. if you want laugh go it 2/10 ( for the fool laugh) ,negative
 Stay away from this movie. Far away. Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a Freakshow. Every performance is flat and unfeeling except Fondacaro's. The plot is a simple one and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible. A group of high-school kids go to a carnival see a side-show and get in over their heads. Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned this is not like any of his other films. This one is lacking in all departments (humor sex horror etc.) other F.O. Ray movies excell in. The version I saw also contained a Making-Of documentry in which the director makes comments like We had a limited budget and with our limited timeline which speaks volumes about how much Charles Band cared about this film. Go rent Droid Runner (Fred Olen Ray) or The Dead Hate the Living (Full Moon) instead. Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves (and that's saying a lot after seeing Killer Eye ) Grade: D- ,negative
 Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer camp slashers. This movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called Camp Blood the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all... The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 mm film with acceptable Special Effects. But instead the Special Effects are poorly done. The killer walks around as if he's out on a Sunday afternoon stroll and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning. Other than that - dull and forgettable. Jasper P. Morgan ,negative
 This is one of those star-filled over-the-top comedies that could a) be hysterical or b) wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead. Unfortunately One Night at McCool's is a classic b. Goldie Hawn recently commented about Town and Country that it's a big problem in Hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed. You have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script they also mangled it daily. Maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say It's the script stupid. This is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through. They're working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre. Is it an unmitigated disaster? Not entirely. There are some smiles along the way mostly due to the efforts of the actors. I probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking Eh. It was okay. So why the undeniably hostile tone in my review? The ending. If as it's been noted the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending then it misses spectacularly. I really wish I could speak specifically about it but I hate people who give too much away (even in warning). Suffice it to say that as soon as you see John Goodman behind a bent-over Paul Reiser (nothing given away here. It's in the trailer) get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking Eh. It was okay. The rest of the movie is tacked-on and creatively bankrupt. And you'll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. If you loved There's Something About Mary or Meet The Parents (both GREAT movies) then don't bother to see this movie. Go have those teeth taken care of instead. ,negative
 I've read other hacks' reviews of this movie and while it certainly isn't the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre it isn't THAT bad if you accept it for what it is - low-budget b-movie fare that (shall we say) borrows heavily from the likes of 'Alien' (nasty extraterrestrial monster that cocoons its victims) 'Species' (gorgeous and confused space girl ) and 'Incubus' (the beastie-breeding-with-captive-girls angle). This is one seriously cheesy movie and the whole thing was obviously done on a shoestring budget although the alien isn't too bad (I've seen far less convincing men-in-rubber-suits at any rate). None of the acting is Oscar material and the Isle Of Man doesn't really double for Boston Massachussetts very convincingly. The plot is fairly predictable too and the premise that an alien craft would travel squillions of miles and crash land smack bang in the middle of an all-girls college campus - thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims - is utterly laughable. However the movie does have its suspenseful moments there's a few helpings of nudity and semi-nudity and the film does feature one of the few movie appearances by the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (as the Space Girl ) who at the age of only 24 was murdered in London by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film. ,negative
 My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with. You'll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab petting his pet rabbit while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. Greg stop clowning! scolds Dr. Brandon. You'll laugh as J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table while his hand is in the shot. And you'll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman has none of the features he used to construct her with. ,negative
 Corey Haim plays a kid who teams up with a dog to take out a giant troll and OSA hit-man (Michael Ironside) with a 30/30 and homemade bombs (Which plays plausible considering Haim) Oh and he also protects his mother and girlfriend as well in this watchable yet disappointing adaption of a decent story. Corey Haim is terrible of course but the movie's sheer momentum as well as Ironside's imposing presence make this at least a modestly effective film. Still the plot is ridiculous and it would've been nicer if we could've seen a monster or at least more gore. At least it's something different. Also it's fairly likely that this film will be the last teen movie for awhile to show a teenager making pipe bombs. Matt Bronson 2/5 ,negative
 I happened upon a rare copy of this early Almodovar film with high expectations - Almodovar is a prolific contemporary director I enjoyed his 1988 film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown and I had read one or two very positive reviews of the film. Well I must have missed completely the humor that the reviewers saw in this film. I just found it incoherent tasteless and boring. Yes there are plenty of innuendos people in drag and crude sexual situations and yes these elements may have shocked audiences in 1982 (which was almost certainly Almodovar's intention) but much of the shock value has probably eroded over the years leaving a limp storyline. Beyond that the whole movie seemed very chaotic none of the characters were particularly sympathetic and for a comedy - even a dark one - I just didn't find this film funny. I suppose it is possible there is a VERY select audience for a film like this but I'm just not part of that audience and not sure that I want to be. ,negative
 Do not watch this movie or.. If you are really mad at anyone you can give this as a birthdaypresent. This is the worst movies I have ever seen. Do NOT watch this. If you do remember: That would be a self-destructive action. It is a shame that this is not voted lower. ,negative
 i didn't like this movie.to me it didn't make much sense.it was hard to figure out what was really happening.i also didn't think it was scary.i did however think it was silly even absurd but not in a good way.Radha Mitchell is the main character in the movie which cam out in 2003.She was also coincidently in 2006's Silent Hill which i hated.it too i found confusing and pointless. Visitors isn't as bad but i think it is certainly below average.there is just nothing special about it.the script is just too muddled and there are things in the movie which don't need to be there in my opinion.I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress if she has more to work with.my vote for Visitors is 4/10 ,negative
 I recently was in a stage version of this play. And on the last day of the run I was excited to see that it was going to be playing on TV. I stuck a tape in as it was on late at night and I watched it the next day. I have to say I was very disappointed. The actors in the film made few of the discovers that are in the script. That is understandable as the resersal process is probably different but it was upsetting to see. A lot of the original script was changed for the movie as well to make it better for the screen but I am not sure if it helped the movie out at all. I gave this 4 stars only because I know the script and the writing is a lot better than what this movie portrays. ,negative
 Firstly the title has no relevance whatsoever to the movie. It started off fine with good development but got annoying when he couldn't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. Even his attempt to tell the police failed which just added to the annoyance value. There were too many pregnant pauses in the movie that seemed more like filler than anything worthwhile. The plot never revealed who did this crime to him although a good plot would have allowed disclosure. The ending was nothing short of hey we've run out of budget let's stop it here NOW!! ...If I'd written a novel that ended this way I'd top myself. TRASH TRASH TRASH!! ,negative
 What a stupid waste of money! 30 000 square feet of rebuilt ancient Rome 2 millions cubic meters of 50 feet tall buildings 10 000 costumes 2 years of works an International Ancient History Committee (sic!) some first class actors and actresses . The final result? An empty TV-movie for a single-digit IQ attendance. ,negative
 I was in Blockbuster and I saw a film called Dark Harvest . The cover art looked great the plot wasn't that bad and the tagline (You reap what you sow) made the movie look pretty good. But I was dumb that day because I did something I should have never done. I rented a Straight To Video Independent Horror Film Walking out with my much better rentals I went home popped Dark Harvest in the DVD player and it began. I figured I would watch the trailer after the film was done (BAD IDEA) but went ahead and watched it anyway. NOW to the review.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* First off the acting by the kids sucks and the scene when the 2 (main characters) are talking the lighting sucks and the buildings even look fake! Now they go to this house where Sean Connel's (I think he's the main character I don't care) relatives lived there. All of a sudden one by one they all start getting killed by...(gasp) A KILLER SCARECROW!!!! AHHH!!!!! The scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget and the scenes where the scarecrow is computerized looks so fake it's hilarious. It makes dinosaur noises and everything! And then at the end...they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (that is red for god's sake and looks like it was purchased at a local family dollar) and it pauses for a while and then.....(gasp) BLOWS UP!!!!!! Save yourself some time I'm telling you this movie sucks. if you need to pass an hour and a half look at the wall because looking at the wall is A+ fun compared to this disaster. It is quite funny though. Overall Grade: F If there was anything lower **F-** Than I would give it that. ,negative
 This was probably intended as an arty crime thriller but it fails on both counts - there are few thrills and not enough substance. The plodding pacing makes it hard to sit through and the occasional action scenes are too sloppily edited and confusingly staged to offer much compensation. At least the level of acting is high. (**) ,negative
 I give it a 2 - I reserve a 1 rating for Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen films. We don't even remember what this movie was about. The only thing we recall is one gunshot scene where the actors drop to the ground roll to the other side of a hallway or something and then get back up shooting. It was like watching 80-year-olds with 2 broken legs trying to perform the 'stunts'. Also when the characters were driving in a truck the engine noise (or radio? can't recall) would vanish entirely when the actors were talking. And like others we bought it because of the Sandra Bullock front cover. very sad very bad. ,negative
 I've watched a number of Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies lately and have found a lot to like about them. This SRE movie seemed a lot more slight than all the others I've seen. Perhaps that's because this is a comedy/horror movie rather than straight horror and perhaps it's also because the humor didn't register with me very well. It's a little less than seventy minutes long and the credits begin as the last ten minutes are beginning. There are some outtakes goofs and behind the scenes stuff going on while those credits roll. SRE movies do tend to be short and tend to feel padded out in spite of that. This is no exception with some scenes that tend to go on too long. The story involves a poor kid in Christmastown California who'd been picked on by all his classmates. He'd had one shoe stolen and unable to replace it he was dubbed Oneshoe McGroo. Due to an obsession with pirates his parents gave him an eyepatch for Christmas with a Christmas tree emblazoned on the eyepatch. Many of the classmates are killed and the few who remain gather together to decide what to do. They're picked off one by one by McGroo who stalks around to the sound of sleigh bells ringing. The characters are pretty much all broad stereotypes like the nerd named Dorkus etc. There's an odd scene in which a kinky couple has sex; the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded the man wears a large paper watermelon slice over his head. This reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from director Rinse Dream. The picture quality is good and there are a lot of extras. But basically a pretty silly movie. Oh well I guess you can never have too many Christmas horror movies. Still there are a lot of other needy holidays. ,negative
 surely this film was hacked up by the studio? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad criminal indeed writing and directing. i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation. ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale. finally not that scary indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice no need for the myth about a german mercenary although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing - seeing the horsemans head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend. no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons oevure. stilted and clipped as my parting shot... ,negative
 I have read all of Shakespeare's plays seen productions of a majority of them and even acted in and directed some. I do not necessarily believe that Shakespeare must be done in the traditional fashion but I hated this movie. There is nudity that is gratuitous and unnecessary. There is grotesqueness that is far beyond what I believe Shakespeare intended. Some of the dialogue is incomprehensible and there are those elements like the singing and dancing that add no meaning to the movie but replace Shakespeare with the director's self-indulgences. I am sorry to say that I wasted perfectly good money to buy the DVD of this movie. ,negative
 A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing. Guy Rolfe so fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three barely features this time and Richard Band's fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film. For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some youth friends of his (many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles - Teresa Hill is quite yummy). Totems minions of the Egyptian God Sutek want the secret of animation life back and the puppets (when they surface) act with a previously unseen cleverness to attempt to destroy the ugly and very computer game looking Totems. The Totems merely complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique - they don't share the weird beauty of the puppets and thus don't really fit in. Top scene is Pinhead using a rag to clean blood from Tunnelers drill bit classic and about the goriest this film goes. The fifth film was filmed concurrently with this one so expect similar sections of mediocre and a Toulon performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era (or even galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserved better and series fans certainly do. Grrrrrrr. ,negative
 It might be that the film I saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw however as the actors are the same I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe differed from the one circulating in the US. Anyway this was the worst movie that I saw the past five years. (Closely followed by The Waterboy...) Why: Because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one mixed them put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it. (Examples: nothing happends the music gets scary and still nothing happends. The grumpy officer us grumpy in a way that would let the actor flunk any acting class. There´s a buddy-moment which comes out of nowhere at the end. There´s an inescapable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone.) If you want to see a smart movie: see Memento. If you want to see a better thriller: see any thriller that comes to mind. If you want to see Patrick Swayze: see Dirty Dancing. ,negative
 I was forced to read this sappy love story between a German 24 year old POW and a 12 year old Jew. That has political correctness written all over it. Its kind of like the movie SPIRIT in which a horse wants to be free but those evil Americans wont let it because they need it. Well i have good news the Americans are evil in The German soldier and his summer book. Why!!! Horses where given to us by god and if the Americans needed a horse the can darn well use it. In the same sense the German had been trying to kill Americans but this book/movie makes it seem OK! The casting is absolutely awful!!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is Hispanic the mother is white the dad it probubly from mostly white descent and the little sister is shirley templish. The acting is pretty bad too the serious parts become comedy! Concluson-Bad movie bad book but both have different endings don't read or see either one! ,negative
 Pluses: Mary Boland is delightfully on edge as always (I never tire of her upper-crust zaniness especially in The Women and Pride and Prejudice ). W.C. Fields's brief role is fun though the famous pool table scene stretches its welcome a bit because it seems to go on for ten minutes. The madcap antics of the film typical of the period are great. Also a nod to Alison Skipworth's wonderfully grounded hotel mistress; I would love to see more of her (she reminds me of Marie Dressler another personality worthy of high praise). Minuses: Gracie Allen. An irritating unfunny presence whose annoyance went unmatched until the rise of Adam Sandler. That near-falsetto nasalness tinged with an accent of unknown origin gets old in her very first scene. This is the first of the Burns-Allen films I have seen and while I (as a big classic comedy buff) try to experience at least one film with every major comedy star this is definitely one team I will not be calling upon again. Her timing and interpretation of the material is totally off. A maddeningly mediocre talent. The bottom line: An OK comedy but the gags are few and far between. And at only an hour long you can expect that this is not an A grade Hollywood comedy. Recommended only for Boland and Fields fans who want to see all of their work. ,negative
 This movie wasn't too funny. It wasn't too horrible either. Just a fun ride aboard the Soul Plane. It's a black-owned flight service with a kick-ass disco beautiful bar and pumping stewards. The plot takes you through the whole idea of a black (not race or color but 'style') -owned plane with the same style of black humor. At times there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the 'normal' lavatory in the 'normal' plane. Check that out. There are lulls however and I find it most in the character who played the Soul Pilot. Watch to find out who it is. All in all it's a fun movie. Tom Arnold adds to the fun with his 'cracker' attitude. This is one movie to watch when playing poker when you're drunk or just vegging. ,negative
 A bare-faced rip-off of Se7en and not fit to clean its shoes. The word 'predictable' must have invented for just such an occasion as this. Lambert is wooden as always (his moments of 'emotion' are laughable as is his accent). The 'climax' is not that at all as we've had so many signals and by the end we're simply immune to flesh rotting and otherwise. Altogether a real mess. ,negative
 I gave Soul Plane the benefit of the doubt and thought there would actually be something of comedic value in it. Im not black but that does not mean I cant appreciate black comedy. I know that because I happen to enjoy watching the Wayans Bros Good Times and other series. I've seen crap movies and Im not easily repulsed. As for Soul Plane I didn't even bother finishing it. Don't know if they managed to land the plane and I couldn't care less. It would be unfair to say I didn't find some parts funny as I did laugh but I also laugh at Youtube videos of skateboarders falling on their nuts so that doesn't say much. The men in the movie were like a bunch of howling horny hyenas in mating season looking to get some whenever and where ever possible. And we wonder why all those stereotypes don't seem to disappear. To summarize: Soul Plane makes the Harold and Kumar series look like The Godfather. ,negative
 I saw this movie and I do like horror movies. I did not know what to expect but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it. The idea was pretty original and the acting was nice. Especially Jenna Dewan as the exciting/evil Tamara. The hardest thing about horror movies is to make a good ending. But there the movie failed. For a change a end-scene in a hospital where suddenly all employees are gone. First you see doctors and nurses running around but then they all went home? No cries for help while being chased by Tamara Escaping to the roof (also a smart move...not) and off course a kind of open ending. No....the movie started great the main part was nice to watch but they really messed up the ending using all clichés from bad horror movies. Jeffrey Reddick failed in my eyes with this movie after making some really quality movies like Final Destination 1 and 2. If you like a good horror full of cliché endings Tamara is a good movie to watch. For me I like movies which surprise me. ,negative
 I cannot believe this show was okay-ed. First off J.P. Manoux does a horrible job filling in for David Spade and Pacha's voice is too deep compared to John Goodman's. The theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid!!! The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton remain as the voices of Yzma and Kronk. This show is a waste of money and a waste of your time. Half of the episodes are copied of the movie. In my opinion The Emperor's New Groove was one of the best children's movies in years but they complety ruined by making Kronk's New Groove and this show. You should watch such shows as Spongebob Fairly Oddparents Danny Phantom or Kim Possible but not this show. ,negative
 Final Fantasy: Advent Children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong. Instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game Square Enix has churned out a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. Yes I said incomprehensible. Did you know that Tifa knows blindingly fast Kung Fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second? That Cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with his 2-ton sword? The English dub is mediocre. While not egregiously bad it is far from well-produced. The quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub. Here is what I'd like to say to the die-hard FFVII fans who can't stop gushing over this movie: Advent Children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from Square Enix but even a trashy CG flick like Galerians: Rion had a better story. You'll be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due time. The days of its novelty are numbered. Movies like Advent Children make me question whether Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and no offense) it's a Japanese company. Japanese developers can deliver fun games but most of their offerings are disappointingly shallow. They are utter psychos however when it comes to production quality. Advent Children features some of the most breathtaking renders in CG history but that doesn't save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters. Any fan who followed this film knows Sephiroth comes back. Bending the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake. NOTE: The one point I give this film is in honor of the 10 000 enslaved Japanese animators who gave their lives to render each bleached blond hair on Cloud's effeminate Caucasian head. ,negative
 So many bad reviewers it made me wonder what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director??? Did you all expected a super-hit flawless movie?? No way you already can see Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-starrer movies... All of his earlier works where multi-starrers but no one was flawless. Take the first Jaani Dushman for instance so many flaws but still good fun. Anyways sticking to the movie the movie Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy film about a snake who can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli) which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover (Manisha Koirala) on the people who caused it. Its quite good with a great star-cast. But i think it could have been much much better. For instance take the script can't say its flawless. For example Take the ages: Do 40-48 yrs old still study in university?? There are many many more i won't list more but there are dozen more. A solid 5.5 is good for this one. **.75 ,negative
 For the first time in reviewing films I found myself immediately uninterested in this story. I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters but it felt bland overused and completely unoriginal. Within the first thirty minutes I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt as if I had seen this structure before and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me. After thinking that it may just be my mood I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning but the same feeling persisted. I just didn't care. That is not a good sign. The characters were bland. When I say bland I literally mean that by watching them develop you will never have any flavor hit your palate. The story seemed recycled nearly to the point of plagiarism. Now I am not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story but she added nothing fresh to the perspective. The casting was horrid the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (nor the characters) and the stories were vague and sloppy. You knew nothing about anyone or anything and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters we instead found ourselves with drugs minor sex and money pushed into our faces. These are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time yet somehow could not be creatively captured by Wayne. What immediately pulled me away from this story? It was mainly the characters. I have seen most of Brad Renfro's work and honestly he needs to redefine himself. Director Larry Clark has defined him and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character. Within the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen time I was bored. I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was spectacular nor impressive just repetitive. He needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role instead of just blandly playing this random socialite. Without a strong character the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown. Renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film. While I am on the subject  nobody showcased the best of their abilities. What is going on with Dominique Swain outside of Lolita I don't believe she has really emerged as an actress and following-up with roles such as Cat Storm doesn't help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress that I witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting she was lost. Rambling here and there and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act. Melanie Griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her TWO scenes that she was in. Maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from The Kids in the Hall who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project. My biggest problem outside of the acting was the pacing of this film. Nothing and this is hard for me to say but nothing gelled together. There were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed. The robberies the teenage angst and woe the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is the random Kids in the Hall guy and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together. With this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape. Family structures were never defined characters were never given any emotion and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers. Wayne did not complete the task at hand. While I hate to put the entire burden on the director with this film I am left with little choice. With a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any good behind Tart. This was a film I had heard nothing about and after viewing it I can see why. All Wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film Tart. It is hard for me to say this but Wayne ruined this film. While I don't believe there was much to fully take from the story any remaining elements of excitement were drained as Wayne took the helm. While most of the time you can credit some of the story perhaps strong acting or even the music in Tart you can credit nothing. From the opening sequence until the end I felt like I was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal. No consistency no strength. Overall this film is a waste of your time. If you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society you will not find it in this film. While I know that was what Wayne was attempting to show the final product seems like it was edited on an Etch-a-Sketch. It was an embarrassing film to sit through and encourage nobody to pick it up. Wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her Columbia University education and destroyed two hours of my life. Avoid at all costs! Grade: * out of ***** ,negative
 I've read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems in the cruel light of 2007 a very sloppy late-RKO assembly-line product. All that endless documentary footage of fish waves fish waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time. The editing is downright careless: Scenes just end and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialog bears the stilted traces of the Odets origins: high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people. But what's really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is on all sides. I love Stanwyck but she snarls and contorts and lashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard. Douglas overplaying at being lovable then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy as is Ryan snarling and shouting most unnaturally. The less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes whose character is kind of a Neanderthal by today's standards nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as Stanwyck's (much younger one presumes) brother and Marilyn Monroe as his girlfriend is natural and unaffected. On Monterey's windswept coast (and all that Monterey footage while largely irrelevant is interesting as a document of what the town looked like) amid all the overheated hysteria these two are islands of sanity. A final point and a spoiler: Perhaps the Breen Office mandated it but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wifey but I give the marriage a month. ,negative
 Ok if you like yer monster moovies sullen stiff starchy and thunderously dull but with lots of throttling then head right for Lady Frankenstein a stagy costumy Italian corpse-walker. Joseph Cotten( Citizen Kane )plays the crusty old Baron himself and must have really needed to make that condo payment. Sexy Sarah Bay who has played in cow-ntless European B-films usually as Rosabla Neri including Hercules Against the Moon Men plays his ambitious daughter a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress. Cotten makes an ugly big-headed monster (cud it really be that much effort to make a nice one??) who immediately throttles Cotten(who took his royalty check & ran) and wanders around throttling everyone in sight. Tania(Bay) decides to switch the brain of her lover(who is old and wrinkly) with the brain of a younger man (who is beautiful but stooopid) in order to make ANOTHER monster to throttle the first monster Cotten made who is wandering around throttling people. Well after much exposition and some throttling the 2 monsters throttle each other for a bit Tania stabs the first monster in the back and then has sex in the flaming ruins of her mansion with the second monster - only to have him throttle her! Doh! There is so much throttling going on that you almoost overlook the fact that the film is about as exciting as a dead carp and mooves just as quickly. The Alpha Video version I saw for this review was heavily edited and one wonders cow much nekkid people were chopped out not that it would have improved the film much. Director von Theurmer previously helmed a variety of grade Z Euro-trash including Jungle Warriors Island of the Dead (as Mel Wells) and The Crucified Girls of San Ramon . The MooCow says avoid this corpse of a film and find something that mooves at moore of a full...throttle. ;=8) ,negative
 The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment which was (thank God) the last one. None of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the Magnificent Seven and Bernstein's rousing music theme. The production values resemble those of a made-for-TV movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in parts II and III you couldn't remember their names here you can't even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for the role of Chris but nobody could have replaced Yul Brynner in our minds anyway. Don't waste your time. ,negative
 What I miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination everything is said. It is like a documentary film but not as good as a documentary because it is no documentary. A patchwork film without a continuous story. Very superficial nothing to think about because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think. Too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think. I do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny. Many scenes are very unrealistic and the acting is quite poor. The film is quite boring. ,negative
 Would a different translation have made it chillier or scarier? Are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language? Does it even matter? You may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting. Well this is an opportunity to judge for yourself. If this isn't about homosexuality murder dismemberment psychopaths insanity deviant psychology then it is about acting - acting helped along with lots of dialog So enjoy the acting or muse about how titillating the dialog actually is. For English speakers Twelve Angry Men might be a better choice. There's a bit more interaction and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialog. You don't have to wonder if you're missing something. I would recommend Andy Warhol's Empire to those who like this film. ,negative
 Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was in a word insane . Now I'm doubting whether this guy actually ever saw it because that isn't the way I would summarize it in one word. Disgusting absurd um more disgusting...would do it. Every time you think it can't get any more filthy it does. One of my particular favorites was when Divine had her birthday party and when the cops came to bust it up they were butchered and eaten by the guests. I admit that it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque you simply can't look away but this is by no means a creative work of art. It's pure shock value. On the upside it makes the Jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies. ,negative
 I first watched this show hoping for a few laughs good acting and good plot. Sadly I got none of those things. First off this show is completely unrealistic. How can someone go to a boarding school that's super hip awesome location and barely any rules? Plus a sushi bar. A SUSHI BAR. No school has a sushi bar. And what's up with the huge ultra cool ultra hip dorm rooms? This doesn't happen in boarding schools! Everyone in this show seems to be perfect. Zoey looks perfect has the perfect friends never has to do homework and is super popular. Sounds more like a villain to me! I hate how they use so many cliques in this show Example: Dana the skater chick. She is completely ignorant and wears edgy clothes. The jokes are old sooooo old too! I wouldn't watch this show if I were you it's one of the most horrible shows I have ever watched and I hope it gets canceled soon! Rating: 1/10 ,negative
 I can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom. It's like they didn't even bothered trying ro write good comedy just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks. The worst of all this is that it's all so damm uninteresting and lacking in every way. To make things worse leading man Kevin James has a permanent I'm so funny smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department which he doesn't he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby. Which takes me to the relationship between the Heffernan's- easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple on any TV show really headache inducingly obnoxious Remini spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband. Jerry Stiller yanking the few laughs on the show is doing a 100% repetition of his role as Frank Costanza in Seinfeld only this time his hints mostly tread on water due to the inability of the central duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them. The episodes just drift along in a stream of nothingness their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse.

 No gore no blood no gratifying death scenes...dumb dumb dumb dumb. Dear God sitting through this movie made me sick. Sick sick sick. Very boring...extremely boring... Theres not even a humorous aspect to this film! i cant find a good thing to say about it other than the lead guy had a nice body...I guess. Definitely not worth the fifty cents I paid to rent it. ,negative
 Every time I've seen this movie I get the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up they aren't intentional and there are a lot of them; the rest is just plain bad stupid and/or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result-it' stupid and cheesy because Sam Raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do. This movie doesn't have that excuse it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably. The crap result gets heaped on top of the crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can be given is one for 'awful.' Watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a Billy Madison essay-- Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I should be able to give this movie something around a -5. ,negative
 I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment. I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years so I really can't say that much about it. It still seems to be very hard to find on video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night UHF channel television of the mid 1980s when I was about 10 years old. So I've never actually seen the beginning of the movie but I saw most of it. The first thing I remember is this couple is sneaking out of a campsite and they're rowing to an island to make out and then they get attacked by an insane Scotsman in a kilt with an axe! They manage to escape from him but get attacked by the Loch Ness Monster which in this movie is just a head and a neck with no body. The eyes and the mouth of the monster don't even move it looks like a piñata. I mean I had just literally never seen anything on this magnitude before and it totally blew my mind. I had seen some bad movies on TV in the early 80s but I had never seen something so totally inept and so casually and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed like the people who made it spent less time and effort on it than we did watching it. I had already seen some of the Troma films and that type of thing that tries to deliberately be campy but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with truly great bad film-making. This movie was like the last gasp of the drive-in era and I caught a whiff of it just in time. Actually when we were watching it we couldn't figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s. Turns out it came out just a few years before I saw it. Later I came into contact with Mystery Science Theater and found out about a lot of the old B movies and serials but I had already seen it in this movie. The movie is so funny that I had never even laughed that hard at the Monty Python crew or Bill Murray or any comedian. After seeing this movie I was always trying to search for the good bad movies and I got a lot of my friends into it. But this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find. I never really found out what it even was or who Larry Buchanan was until the 1990s when IMDb took off and the internet took off and information started getting passed around. But this movie still needs to be discovered by a lot of others who might appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities. Look for it. ,negative
 This movie was really funny even though it wasn't meant to be! The acting was stupid and so were the voices. Pretty much all it was was some guy walking around a corn maze for an hour and a half. They threw in this stupid super natural thing that made it even dumber. It wasn't even like a normal movie this weird creepy music was playing almost the whole way through the movie. What is it with corn maze horror films? Children of the corn was really scary I thought and I thought this would be something like it but really it was just stupid. The main character guy just walked around aimlessly yelling for these two little girls. And then at the end he like kills someone or something. It's worth seeing if you're with your friends because it's really funny how bad it is but if you're looking for a horror movie then don't waste your time ,negative
 I recently rented this film on DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice seeing as I am both from the north of England (Bradford) and also interested in film-making. However it soon became apparent that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development script-wise. The characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance. The subject matter could be an interesting basis for a film. However the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused. The ending felt as though it was casting judgement on the characters - punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary. This felt a little awkward and silly and seemed at odds with the 'realism' used in the style of shooting. For me the film dealt with the characters and subject matter in a rather heavy handed and clumsy manner. It felt as though the writer had already decided how he wanted to end the story and set about crow-barring everything else in to fit it. Another point that I feel strongly about is the watered-down Ken Loach feel the film had. I get quite upset that UK film financiers can't see that there is more to British films than 'gritty realism'. It has become almost a safe option. Film is an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and it is not being exploited by UK feature film producers. There is a lot of talent here in the UK. It's unfortunate that most of these individuals end up either making music videos and commercials 100% of the time or they go to America. Love + Hate would have worked better if it had been cut down to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one-off TV drama. ,negative
 This unintentionally amusing mid-80s TV movie is based on the premise that sex bomb Donna Mills (in a mostly appalling wardrobe throughout) is a neglected housewife pining for her sexy past as a cheerleader. She escapes her empty life by fantasising about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across finally giving into her fantasies and indulging in a bit on the side although all she really wants is to reignite the flames of passion with her boring husband James Brolin. There are many laughable aspects to this film Mills' first foray into co-producing (later following her departure from Knots Landing she found great success as a trashy TV movie queen starring in mostly issue-of-the-week melodramas through most of the '90s - she usually played a victim of some sort clearly determined to wash her hands of the wonderfully wicked and entertaining conniver she played for so long on Knots). Funniest are the drawn-out fantasy sequences filmed as though they are meant to be soft-core porn (wind and smoke machines backlighting porno music) but as this is a network TV movie the scenes are all very chaste and ultimately not very sexy at all. The most amusing (and bizarre) scene has Mills taking a walk on the wild side downtown among the spiky-haired punks (complete with Robert Palmer soundtrack). Less laughable is the dreadful dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to utter (pity poor Cicely Tyson as the mandatory psycho-analyst or Veronica Cartwright as the mandatory best friend or even pre-Babs James Brolin with that daytime soap style of clenched fist anger.) Of course as in all of these sorts of films we learn that all problems can be solved through psycho-therapy and then the film just becomes silly as we explore briefly the reasons for Mills' shocking behaviour (as if it can't just be that she wants a good shag!) Vacuous. ,negative
 Boasting some pretty good Rick Baker-esque special effects and Deran Serafian in a small role this pretty lame Italian movie deserves some recognition. Cerchi gets some credit for still making gore flicks while most of the other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato Sergio Martino Lamberto Bava and Enzo G. Castellari) have moved on to lower-key TV movies. As for plankton it's half Piranha - half The Thing with people turninging into monsters raping women and causing general mayhem. The ultra-grimy sleazy and over-sexed feel of the film makes it hard to enjoy. Only available in Italian language work-prints floating around. ,negative
 Awkward disaster mishmash has a team of scavengers coming across the overturned S.S. Poseidon hoping to loot it before it goes under for good. Irwin Allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster The Poseidon Adventure arrived in theaters SEVEN YEARS LATER! Never mind that nobody cared anymore why give us such a shoddy production filled with dim characters and miscast actors only to trash the memory of your biggest hit? One might end up feeling really sorry for Michael Caine Sally Field Peter Boyle Jack Warden Karl Malden and Shirley Jones were it not for their lost-at-sea expressions (good for a few stray laughs). There's a moment when saintly Jones is tempted into taking some treasures just for herself and she timidly starts stuffing her pockets that is an unintended hoot. The film was a career bungler for all concerned most especially Allen who never quite recovered from this. * from **** ,negative
 Wow! This movie is almost too bad for words. Obviously the writers wanted to somehow link this to the Ghoulies franchise so they got Pete Liapis from the first one to reprise his role as Jonathan...only now he's a cop and has no similar character traits as he did in the first one. The ghoulies in this one aren't the ghoulies from the last ones. The cheap looking puppets have been replaced with even cheaper looking costumed little people. Instead of being any main antagonist or being evil they are more like the comic relief characters that appeared out of nowhere for no reason. When watching this film for the first time it felt like I'd seen it before. Why was this? Because everything in this was stolen from another movie. All the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from Lethal Weapon. The ghoulies were pretty much like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck except they weren't amusing at all. Even scenes from the original Ghoulies film were sprinkled throughout this flick. I think the target audience was supposed to be adults but the mixture of black magic cartoon slapstick cop drama and bad acting doesn't work at all. I hope they don't make a Ghoulies V because I don't want a movie studio to lose their money. My rating: BOMB/****. 78 mins. R for violence. ,negative

 This Film Was One Of The Worst Films I Have Ever Seen. This Movie Drags On and On and I Almost Turned It Off But I Gave It A Shot. I Wasnt Expecting Anything Great But I Was Expecting More Than This. Good Thing I Work At A Video Store and Saw This For Free Because I Would'nt Spend One Dime On This Movie. I Gave This Movie a 2 Only Because I Have Seen Worse. If I Were You I Would Stay Away From This Very Far Away. ,negative
 Thursday June 9 6:45pm Broadway Performance Hall & Saturday June 11 1:45pm Broadway Performance Hall Bless the independent filmmaker. Without them we'd see nothing but Spielberg the Farrelly brothers and films based on old sitcoms. They are the risk takers. They reap the rewards of success and suffer the failures. Max and Grace is most definitely a failure. Credit is deserved by Michael Parness for getting out there and making his first feature which he claims drove him to bankruptcy. He might be better off sticking to the stage if this film is any indication of what to expect in the future. Even though everyone warned me I went to see Max and Grace anyway hoping I might discover something they did not. It starts off well enough a party for Max in his parent's house shot in warm subdued light the camera floating into interesting angles. As soon as we see Max has hung himself an obvious rip-off of Harold and Maude the whole thing goes right in the tank. How could he do this unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party? For that matter how could two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to get married and do it with the blessings of all parties concerned? In the Q&A after the film David Krumholtz suggested the entire story was the surrealist dream of his character Max. This story is so badly written the comment sounded more like an excuse. The film doesn't look as though it was made on a shoestring all the more reason to be so disappointed with the results. What's intended as funny isn't but instead is offensively bad. The continuity is sloppy the lighting is dreadful and the effects look cheap and forced. BPH seats under three hundred and was surprisingly full but I saw at least thirty or forty walkouts within the first half-hour. At one point Grace played by Natasha Lyonne laments her inability to die. I found myself thinking the same thing since I never walk out before the credits. If Krumholtz really thinks this is one of the best scripts he has ever read it sounds like he needs to catch up on his reading. A terrible waste of talent and resources this is the worst independent I've seen since Bubba-Ho-tep. ,negative
 The Duke is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old Duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Heyman); he passes his Dukeship down to his dog. The dog's best friend an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke due to him being her great uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives with him and Charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub-plot which in its own way acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of Hubert The 'Duke' and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. All this is watched over by James Doohan who plays a Butler who is determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master Hubert. Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor. Though from the technical viewpoint I dislike this film as I only watched upon discovering James Doohan's role. Though the plot is good elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured. Ignoring the absurdity of a Doggie Duke I personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the 'bad' characters due to their ludicrousness. The dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me. The director Phillip Spink uses mid-long shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality. Plus the acting of Muirhead and Heyman whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role. But as a mature movie fan I find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh. I can admit I found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far-fetched but has definite connections. I do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but I do highly recommend it to Dog lovers families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and James Doohan fans who wish to see 'Scotty' in his final role. ,negative
 i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14. i was really annoyed with my little cousin as she was very hyper that day so i saw a film on the Disney channel and put it on and told her to watch it. she is 6 and she loved the film some bits she didn't get like the ending but i didn't get that either y was Eddie the star of the video shoot i thought it was Jordan's video?! but she did enjoy it. i noticed the mistakes such as at the end Jordan was not actually playing the guitar but she never. it is definitely a film for if you are seriously bored or 10 and under. it calmed my cousin down well. although all she did was sing for the rest of the day then. ,negative
 At least the jingle by Tim Finn was melodic. Roberts is the his usual inept self. Characters are inconsistent dull purposeless. Roberts changes his accent even within one line. ,negative
 I think I've finally seen the Worst Movie Ever Made and it hurts me to say that. As a big fan of indie cinema gay or otherwise I had high hopes. Several minutes into the film however the sheriff appeared and has my vote for the worst actor of this or any other century. His performance and the dialog he was forced to perform caused me the unusual step of stopping the DVD in its track. Hours later when I screwed up enough courage to press the play button again it was no better. Aside from the sheriff and his cartoon-racist deputies the film has an attractive cast for whom I felt genuine sympathy since they had such a miserable script. The idea behind the film is fine - using lynching of gay men in the New South the same way it was used on black men in the Old South leaving strange fruit hanging from the trees. With an accomplished writer and director we might have had a movie. Instead we get fake detective work platitudes about homosexuality and a cliché with a the one good white man trying to save the day. I have no doubt that racism still flourishes. The FBI is currently investigating a white school bus driver in the back woods of Louisana who forced the black kids to get to the back of the bus. But this town is a cartoon and it is hard to believe anything you see or hear. There a few subplots in a weak attempt to try to make the main character more three-dimensional but for the most part they also fail miserably. For the truly masochistic the DVD contains some deleted scenes that will leave you running for cover. The is probably the first movie that makes me believe that writer/directors should have to pass a test and get licensed before they can make a film. Although I would look forward to seeing several of the cast members in better films I would be hard-pressed to witness anything else from this director. ,negative
 I`m in two minds about FOLLOWING the film debut of Christopher Nolan . Part of me admires it for costing 6 000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI a film I disliked and I can`t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . Wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6 000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of MEMENTO ? ,negative
 If you see the title 2069 A Sex Odyssey in the video store BEWARE!! The cover has Tori Wells and three other 80's porn stars and has a copyright of 1986. If you're like me (and I hope you're not) you'll think 80's porn? Tori Wells? Alright! Trickery!! It was made in 1974 and has dubbed German stars! There's nothing inherently wrong with 70's German porn but it's not my cup of tea and it's nothing like what the cover leads you to believe you're getting. Once I got past my rage about the blatantly misleading jacket I watched it anyway. It's a bad bad movie. Sorry I guess I didn't really get past the rage. ,negative
 I'm a sucker for mob/gangland movies so I rented this movie. This movie is a complete train wreck. With all the big name actors in this film I can not believe how bad it was. It was so bad that I began laughing hysterically towards the end of the film. The actor better known as Zues or the big dude from the Ice Cube movie Friday does an incredible overacting job throughout the film. First thing I told Blockbuster when I returned the film was to remove this garbage from their shelves. Do not rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life. If they come out with a sequel I wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first. I will be more cautious when renting so called 'mob/gangland' movies. ,negative
 When people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said LITTLE. These children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter (in a film). Lets start with the blonde - Debbie - She's a slut of a girl i mean come on she wears mini skirts she has stupid frizzy blonde hair and a freckley red bunny like face. She acts so innocent. Next we have the second child - the Geek - who thinks he's so cool with his long range shooting and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and most of all his evil bratty smile. The next kid is the quiet one you don't care about so thats all on him. This film angered me at the children's intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept bitching about them. ,negative
 It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery. Actually this isn't as bad as some critics say but it isn't good either. It IS amusing and DOES play like a poor country cousin of the Conan line making it a conflicted uneven poor work. And speaking of poor the quality is terrible due to the era in which this was filmed but that is not the only reason. The story herein is inferior even to the Conan line but moreover it loses itself in the Red Sonja must be dominated by big strong Schwarzenegger ploy and entirely forgets its purpose if it ever had one. It's entertaining but in a low-budget guilty-pleasure B kind of way. It rates a 4.2/10 from... the Fiend :. ,negative
 Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years back wanted to cast Dilip Kumar in the lead The film finally was re-written and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at times Like the reason Amitabh-Hema separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like Gulshan in AVTAAR The message though comes well but things are presented in a clichéd manner Salman's character is the worst looks straight out of a storybook while the climax speech of Bachchan is good and also the final of not forgiving the sons is good Ravi Chopra does a good job Music is decent the songs sung by Bachchan stand out Amitabh excels like always he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well His last speech is great Hema is good in her part Aman Verma stands out Samir Soni is okay Naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent though Divya Dutta stands out Salman Khan is fake Mahima is okay Paresh and Lillete are lovable ,negative
 I don't think I can add much more to what has already been said about this film. However I can offer a small recollection from seeing ST-V in the theater. In the last (dreadful) scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison. Normally for a movie like this at least -some- die-hard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer. As the people filed out I remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmurs. I remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only Trek fans would like it. What an idiot. The fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart first! Favorite worst scene: Target shooting on a Voyager space probe through a periscope no less! Space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought. ,negative
 By the time this movie came out in 1996 director Mark Lester had been making tight sharp little B action pictures for more than 20 years. He was responsible for the great Truck Stop Women from the '70s and several other little gems; unfortunately he's also responsible for this dud. It's a shame to see the talented--and still smoking hot--Theresa Russell wasted yet again but she's still the best actor in this picture. Eric Roberts shows up for a while does his Eric Roberts thing then goes away a not altogether unwelcome occurrence in a picture with Eric Roberts in it. Frank Stallone actually isn't bad which should give you an idea of how truly pathetic this picture is. As has been mentioned by other reviewers the action scenes--which is the reason a picture like this gets made in the first place--are almost completely illogical and unrealistic in addition to being somewhat inept. Other than some vintage clothes and a few old cars there's no feel whatever for the 1930s the era in which this film is set. A by-the-numbers script with irritating lapses in logic and little historical accuracy--this isn't a documentary of course but the filmmakers could have at least TRIED for a little authenticity--and performances that range from grade B to grade school relegate this cheap little quickie to the 4:00 a.m. Sunday slot on HBO which is just where I saw it. ,negative
 R Xmas peers into the lives of a middle class married-with-kid family of narco-distributors during the Christmas holiday season. There's no story here - just a disjointed collection of events. Ferrara seems to get off on the juxtaposition of the holidays and home life with narcotics peddling in NYC jumping back and forth between each. The players appear to be improv'ing and adlibing now and then making for an unconvincing watch. Overall a poor effort not worth the time. (D) ,negative
 The film has weird annoying characters strange unexplainable slapstick and an insurmountable amount of dialogue about smoking. The movie has a contrived plot of a bitchy empty-headed woman's (Jeanne Tripplehorn) search for love. Although who would ever like Jeanne's character personality or reading of the dialogue I really cannot say. Except that she likes to smoke. Sarah Jessica Parker gives an interesting character performance (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look pretty and soulful (as he smokes). And hey what is Jennifer Aniston doing there? Oh she's not really in it enough for anyone to care about her. (But she likes to smoke). This is a waste of anyone's time. I don't even know how I was able to sit through as much of the movie as I did. I can't even believe I spent the time to write this except to warn others of its banality. Anyone need a cigarette? ,negative
 I can barely find the words to describe how much this piece of trash offended me. Why is it that American filmmakers always go out of there way to portray Jamaicans as a bunch of backwards ass bush babies and worse yet cast people to play Jamaicans who sound utterly ridiculous when they try to imitate the accent? We are not all extremely dark we do not all walk around carrying machetes whether for work OR PROTECTION we do not walk around naked in our homes and we do not practice VOODOO!! We are doctors lawyers architects Businessmen and women musicians actors AND FILMMAKERS. I am sick and tired of watching all of these portrayals of Jamaicans as a bunch of dreadlock wearing Rastafarians who do nothing but sit around all day smoking weed on a beach or shooting guns in the air (When we're not living in our tree houses). YES we wear clothes. YES we have electricity. No weed is not legal on the island AND CHANCES ARE WE SPEAK BETTER English THAN YOU! The worst part is this isn't just me being angry and bitter these are actual answers to questions that most Jamaicans who have traveled overseas have been asked at some point. Read a book before you assume what's it's like in another country and worse yet decide to make a movie about it. WELCOME TO JAMAICA! The land where all we do is murder white people and beat our bongos drums...Tales from the Crypt has officially sickened me along with the entire crew of people who worked on this garbage especially the writer. ,negative
 I would give this a zero if they had that rating. Fun was no fun at all. I grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. The others I watched this movie with also agreed. The acting was annoying. I am tired of Jim Carey's over the top ham acting. The supporting cast was no better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under the vehicle for this would have been better served another way. I actually disliked the leading characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. I am trying to recall one scene where I or anyone I was with laughed and cannot. A worthless movie and a total waste of time. ,negative
 This movie has been advertised for over three months in Greece as the biggest Greek production ever. Well it could be but... When you hear of a big production you expect to see something new something different. What you get to watch here is a movie with no reason of existence. George Corraface looks like he didn't really enjoy making this movie. His acting is so simplistic that looks almost amateur. The sound especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English (dubbed?) is full of hiss. The thankfully few special effects showing Istanbul and Athens in the late 50's and early 70's are more like digital paintings than computer graphics. Finally we see the same boy from 1959 (age 5) up to 1968 (age 14) but in a miraculous way he becomes a teenager five years later. So much for the biggest Greek production . At least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production. And all one gets is a love story between 7 year-olds who meet again 40 years later. Oh there is a political side too. A couple of ironic remarks about the Greek junta of '67-'74 so childish that seem almost forced. There are of course a couple of good things in the movie: most of the actors are great mainly Ieroklis Michaelidis the very good scenery and the magnificent music by Evanthia Remboutsika; but they are so few for such an expensive production. Bottom-line: Is it so bad a movie? To tell the truth I don't know. I just know that in no point does it justify its huge (for Greek standards) budget. ,negative
 Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid. There is not one funny line or gag in the entire film. This film is so bad it makes the Austin Powers films look Shakespearean. A few more films like this and Steve Carell can kiss his career goodbye. As for Anne Hathaway what is she doing in this film? She's a good actress but is just plain terrible. The writing is pathetically lame. There is not one funny clever or witty line. There is not one good sight gag. The directing is terrible. Comedy relies on timing. Someone should tell the director that. Every line that is supposed to be funny (and isn't) is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing I've ever seen. 0 stars ,negative
 This must rate with the worst films I have ever seen. It just wasn't funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you. If you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an English radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious. The strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom. What did happen in the strip club made no sense at all. There was a great deal of mumbling by the lead character with whom I developed no sympathy at all. Mena Suvari was hardly in the film presumably just there to make people think it was a serious attempt at producing a film. The bad guys were unconvincing and carried as much menace as a dead sheep. ,negative
 Does anyone care about any of the characters in this film? - Or for that matter what happens to them? - I doubt it. That is the key problem - for a tragedy to work we have to care about at least one of the characters and none of them inspire any sympathy or appear to have any redeeming qualities at all. What may have worked in the 16th Century certainly does not work in one can only assume 'post apocalyptic Liverpool' if that was indeed what it was meant to be. The problem is the characters in post apocalyptic Liverpool whilst still driving around in cars using mobile phones and watching television have reverted to speaking in Shakespearian language - with a Liverpudlian dialect. Oh dear! Bad enough you might think - but this often lapsed into pure scouse - with comments such as 'eh lah are you a cockney? And was that a Merseyrail announcement during one of the scenes filmed in the underground? Well the good news is that in Post apocalyptic Liverpool - the trains are still running. The characters without exception are badly drawn wooden and more like charicatures on the lines of the Joker/Penguin in Batman and Robin except there is no real storyline to speak of - or if there is - it is one that doesn't work in a modern setting where half the sets are gloomy and 'Blade runnerish' and the other half are fluorescent garish or just 21st century normal. Costumes are also mixed up with half wearing their everyday clothes (Parkers are big in post apocalyptic Liverpool - apparently) and the other half wearing costumes from the leftovers of a fancy dress party? The film explores the ideas of lust incest and revenge in the most inane fashion imaginable - the tragedy is that this film was made at all. ,negative
 I had seen this movie just days before Halloween 2004. I noticed it around lunch-time and it was an interesting description in my menu box so I decided to watch it. Seriously only a movie only suitable for late night TV...you know after Conan but before the infomercials sorta deal. Although this movie has very little to do with webs it does have a lot to do with spiders refer to my heading if you need a refresher. I found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating. A hidden nuclear generator a scientist and a believable portal...Would have been a good start to a cool fantasy but then it goes downhill after 15-20 minutes. The cast is poor with no memorable performances poor quality queen who has had her breasts amplified...considering spiders don't carry breasts. As well as poor sound effects. An obvious low budget movie though the cast has tried. SPOILER: 4 electricians stumble upon a hidden nuclear generator while on a job. They fiddle with the buttons and open a portal. 2 workers fall into the portal and it closes...scrambling to figure out what is going on the party still in our world seeks help while the other party observers their surroundings. Help does not arrive so they open the portal and follow through meeting up in a parallel dimension. They encounter a race of human spiders dubbed soldiers. After a death and chase they are saved by survivors. Now it gets boring...they hide talk a bit try to build another portal then attack the hive. After losing 2 more electricians they open the portal and escape returning to our world...some 200 million years ago. Sounds interesting huh? ,negative
 It has been a tradition since my first VHS recorder for me to collect several of the incarnations of the old chestnut by Charles Dickens and I taped this one and Karroll's Christmas this year. Fortunately when this one was run on the Hallmark Channel at the unGodly hour of 3 AM I was spared having to edit commercials from it. This was however it's only saving grace. The writing was excruciatingly dull with almost no clever scenes to save it from being anything more than a teeny-bopper soaper like Beverly Hills 90210. In this one a good man who was cast aside for her celebrity seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a Scrooge-like TV talk show hostess. It wasted Dinah Manoff who just plays bitch goddess to the other bitch goddess Tori Spelling (who by the way had more coats of paint on her face than some colonial houses) and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise dreary adaptation. Some of the best opportunities are wasted like the entrances of the ghosts. Aunt Marla's entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer but this Christmas turkey didn't have one evidently. Tori Spelling may be a lovely person but she has all the acting skill of a mannequin and that makes for a bad show all by itself. Yes it was good to see Gary Coleman work again but the script gives him nothing to do really except roll his eyes and spout truly lame dialogue. And what is most infuriating was that the transformation from Scroogedom to Tori sweet and light is as convincing as a passionate conservative. Now if anyone wants to write the ultimate Scrooge tale of a George Bush and Karl Rove we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas Carol Clones. I suppose if you're a fan of Ms. Spelling and/or 90210 this might be your cup of Christmas cheer. I'd prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it down myself. This one I just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long time. God save us everyone! ,negative
 I first read about the Left Behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it out since I have an interest in the way religion is used to control people in our ever more hate filled world so imagine my surprise and joy when I found a copy of Left Behind : World at War in my local library nestling innocently among the big budget action movies. Now as a movie it's extremely poor. The acting is straight out of an elementary school production and the special effects would have looked dated in the early 90's. Being the third part of a series the story would be unintelligible to anyone who hadn't seen or read about the other Left Behind movies and even with my prior knowledge it was still pretty laughable. On the religious front I don't think anyone who wasn't already filled with the spirit of the lord would find anything in the movie to convince them to change their ways. How are you supposed to fear the Antichrist when he's got a comedy Russian accent and the worst of his powers are some pitiful CGI? However my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try and dupe people into believing that it's a big budget action movie. Upon picking up the box and reading the spiel I immediately noticed something odd...nowhere on the packaging was there a mention of the true nature of this film. To someone not in the know it would appear for all intents and purposed that Left Behind : World at War was no different from the latest Tom Clancey. Nor on the copy that I rented did it say anything about it being the third in a series. Considering the whole premise of the series is that the Antichrist has deceived the whole world I find it extremely hypocritical that the film makers tried to deceive me TWICE before I even got the to counter! If you're so firm in your beliefs then why not be honest about it? The simple fact is had this not been a Christian movie with the built in fan base that goes with it I seriously doubt it would ever have seen the light of day. If Cloud Ten were hoping that I'd see the error of my ways and give myself to God I'm afraid to say I would have died of boredom and/or laughed myself to death before I ever had the chance. ,negative
 Nishabd means wordless. This must be the condition of the script before the shooting of this film started and therefore throughout this film cries for content. What you go for is an unusual love story between a 60-yr old man and an 18-yr old girl and what you get are very usual very common events that neither excite nor surprise. So what we are left finally is with picturesque locations of Kerala shot brilliantly by cinematographer Amit Roy and camera friendly histrionics of newfound Jiah Khan. This does not cover up for lack of a concrete script. Producer-Director Ram Gopal Varma who has such a good track record of films needs to pull up his socks. As far as Mr. Bachchan goes I don't want to discuss him in context of this film. While reviewing I am feeling loss of words. I am left speechless rather wordless ! Personal Opinion : This film can be compared with an equally bad film released some time back called BLACK. I don't see the difference between the histrionics of lead characters in both the films. What did you say just now- That was a world-class cinema blah blah and I don't have any taste. Well take a walk. No I don't mean literally but actual one to the theaters showing this film. Because in that case you might find this film an Oscar-level material. ,negative
 I was under assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo but it wasn't instead it was something that shouldn't have been made not even for its time. They disguise themselves in the blackface fashion because they fly to Africa and they even act like Stepin Fetchit and all the others rolled into one. There are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics being a mixed woman I have the right to say this but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try Merrie Melodies Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs or Angel Puss you won't find them on DVD because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream but you can find them on a site as YouTube. I don't recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early America was racist and ignorant these are better suggestions not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation i know it was 1932 but I have seen better for its time. Plane unnecessary. -1 out of 10. ,negative
 Silly and violent thriller that is a rip - off of 'Deliverance' but without any charm and intelligence. The plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free of this obnoxious entry. This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way. It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this. ,negative
 I actually belong to the demographic Zoey 101 specifically is trying to target so I can see that as much as it tries to be relatable to people my age the premise is simply too ludicrous for an average person to relate to. The show revolves around the wealthiest boarding school in existence and the lovely incredibly tan attractive gang of one-sided characters who inhabit it. As is the tradition amongst kids networks the cast is an array of skinny white kids with the token black guy of course. The story lines all revolve around Zoey and her gang of friends stumbling upon or creating some sort of minor dilemma such as not wanting to attend gym class resulting in Zoey devising a scheme to save the day for all her friends. There is generally a B-line revolving around either a one- sided guest character or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations such as having a hive of wasps in a dorm room and no one noticing. These plots often play off stereotypes such as any character who pulls good grades in math must by default completely lack social skills. The majority of episodes have the continuous and overused will-they won't-they Chase-Zoey dynamic. The characters unfortunately are all incredibly one-sided; there is Zoey the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything Chase the constantly lovesick still but rather endearing Best Friend Michael the token black guy (kudos to Christopher Massey for managing some genuinely funny one-liners) Lola the theater chick (meaning she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of stardom despite the fact that she never does anything in the actual theater) Logan the womanizing narcissist Dustin the spazzy little brother and Quinn the science geek. The few words I spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely. Zoey 101 does manage to be entertaining at times but the serious flaws in the system of values it promotes are a major turnoff. Zoey who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and who is on the surface portrayed as flawless still manages major character flaws. For example when Lola was first introduced she was believed to be a goth girl. Zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm room for being freaky . As for the acting it is quite clear that Jamie Lynn Spears landed this role because of her name not because of talent. Although she has definitely improved as time goes by it is clear she is not a born actress which greatly affects the quality of the show as most of the plot lines revolve around her character. The supporting cast is surprisingly good especially considering the material they have to work with. They deliver quite a few good one-liners for comic relief if the plot hasn't yet ventured into obscurity. All in all Zoey 101 is a flawed view at high school life and anyone past their Limited Too years shouldn't expect much from it. ,negative
 I mean nothing happens 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana... this could've been fun if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogs weren't even half an inch of fun. The only thing that I almost showed my teeth of was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either Oklahoma or Kansas... The plot could have been fun had it not been for abysmal interpretation. If you even think about watching this piece-of-crap movie don't. How dumb is it that the guy gets away from the cops by telling them he's gay like his friend did (just that he wasn't pretending...) and there's that dumb hick joke about the several meanings to the word gay . I'm laughing my hair off.......NOT....... Anyway... WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!! ,negative
 When I first saw this I thought bits of it were fairly scary. But the horror is a little undermined by the fact that the dozy teenagers are so irritating that you don't really care what happens to them. There are some genuinely good moments such as Angela's speech about demons and the briefly-seen demon itself is effective. But this really doesn't stand up to repeated viewing or close analysis. It's all pretty tacky and cheap-looking and often downright silly pornography and unfunny wisecracks all too often replacing horror. The music is excellent however and the epilogue is certainly amusing but this film doesnt have much to recommend it just comes across as another Jason-type stalk-and-slash fare. ,negative
 I bought this movie for about 2 5 dollars at a local flea market. I thought that with the cast present in this movie (Ice-T Rob Lowe & Mario Van Peebles are all OK) it would be pretty good. Boy was I wrong. This movie annoyed the hell out of me. Almost every scene drags on too long. The scene where Rob Lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I have ever witnessed in a movie. The rest is no picknick either. My guess is when they finished the movie they only had 30 minutes of film so they made everything last 3x longer. Conclusion: The current 1 9 rating here on imdb is right on the money. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Go watch some paint dry for 1 5 hour instead of watching this! If you want to see some better movies made by this director watch 'Mean Guns'(with Christopher Lambert & Ice-T) or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Sheen) instead. ,negative
 I've spent a year deployed in Iraq and amongst the hundreds of movies I've seen here was this little gem called Vampire Assassin. Judging from the cover (African-American with corn-rows with a curved blade leather coat and the demeanor of a badass) I expected a Blade rip-off. Fair enough. So I pop it in and observed a borderlined overweight African-American with no blade no cornrows and well nothing at all really except...I don't know. If you've read any of these other reviews you get the gist of the flick. It sucks. Bad. Really bad. I don't know if it was the Highlander-esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire or the karate-kick sound effects for camera zooms or the twenty dollar budget on props or the ok we have 90 minutes to film this before we're caught filming in a Johnson & Johnson parking lot or the martial arts that is as exciting and fast-paced as two old people having sex or the 7th grade acting talent or the eccentric Asian Master who's either senial or on acid or what but the movie manages to force you to question your existence. And that's awesome. Not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like Scanners. If you heckle (or MST3K) with your friends this is the flick for you. I've seen it three times already and I think it might've caused permanent damage on my psyche. If you STILL don't have any clue as to the quality of the film people were trying to give it away for free and no one would take it. Not even by force. Long story short watch it. Either as masochistic pleasure or punishment. It will rock your skull (and for the most part for all the wrong reasons). ,negative
 I would bet a month's salary The Magnificent Seven Returns (MSR) was made-for-TV. Other reviewers attest that MSR was a theatrical movie and I'll take their word for it. The logical answer must assume it was originally shot for TV and after a change-of-studio-heart it was released theatrically instead. Every actor is primarily a TV actor: Mariette Hartley Michael Callen Ralfe Waite Stephanie Powers... TV performers all. Lee Van Cleef split his time between TV and theater screens. Stephanie Powers has only made 3 or 4 real movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career - proof positive this was shot for TV. Minor players are veteran small-screen actors who can be seen on old reruns of Gunsmoke Wild Wild West Streets of San Francisco and so on. The ho-hum sets are identical to the Universal Studios Tour sets often seen in old episodic TV. And the editing betrays the one-or-two-takes-hurriedness of TV with limited camera movements positioning cutting and lighting. The sound track exclusive of the original Berstein themes are straight from seventies television. Yep I'd bet money it was shot for TV. That's an important point in evaluating MSR. Initially I watched MSR on cable assuming it was an old theatrical release. In comparison to the original Magnificent Seven it's a joke a cartoon an amateurish attempt at movie making. Acting lighting writing settings action cinematography music (exempting the Berstein themes) editing pacing ...on and on....all pale in comparison to the classic Magnificent Seven which is close to the perfect 60's western and one of the great action movies of all time. However viewed as an early 70's made-for-TV movie as I suspect the film is actually better than average. Those unfortunate enough to live through the 70's as an adult know what I'm talking about. MSR would have competed against Alias Smith and Jones and similarly bland network shows. During the seventies Gunsmoke was a quality show concentrating on character development rather than action deemphasizing gun play to two shootouts a week. The first shooting usually a murder sets the hour's plot into motion - the second shootout climaxes the episode by killing the guest star his nemesis or otherwise resolving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. MSR has more action than a whole season of Gunsmoke. In this light - in this frame of reference - MSR is passable entertainment a cut above the TV fare from that decade. ,negative
 The scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient Indian cemetery and while cleaning a vase they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being the Skeleton Man. Then a military squad commanded by Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that vanished in the jungle. They face the Skeleton Man shooting him while he kills each soldier. Then the Skeleton Man goes to a power plant and Captain Leary explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being. I bought Skeleton Man on DVD expecting to see a funny trash but I found an awfully boring annoying and senseless crap with shoots and explosions. The imbecile story is totally disconnected and does not make any sense and the military team is composed of imbeciles insisting in shooting the supernatural Skeleton Man until they are totally slaughtered. Their leader is also the most stupid with the blow-up of an entire facility in the end to destroy the supernatural rip-off of the extraterrestrial warrior Predator. On DVD it is possible to use the fast forward button along the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer. My vote is two. Title (Brazil): Skeleton Man  ,negative
 I would have given this movie a 1 but I laughed so hard so many times that I had to give it a little credit in the off off off off chance the film was Supposed to be funny. A movie so bad you'll think chimps wrote it. You'll wish chimps had written it. Dialogue so canned that only it and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust. The movie Exaggerates its awfulness by intersplicing scenes from the Original Carrie (a really good film) into scenes from this one. Like intersplicing scenes from Taxi Driver into Baby Geniuses. Do not rent it alone as you will NOT enjoy the experience. You will need someone next to you to confirm the badness of what you are viewing. Worst actress of the Millenium goes to poor poor Amy Irving as the stone-faced monotone disastrously wooden school counselor. Worst movie of the year so far (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3 ,negative
 Watching the first few moments you realize it's going to be a parody - and certainly it *is* a parody but I'm not sure of what (a fairy tale? an opera? a Hollywoodian C-movie? - if there was something like that) and I can assure you it's not worth watching. It's simply a pointless film (cf. a good parody is everything but pointless) with pretentious shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or better it's like a botched commedia dell'arte. And the score... sung in an intentionally incompetent way (something Greenaway will use much more efficiently) it *is* painful to listen to (unless one wears some sate-of-the-art earplugs haha). Go for quality movies (e.g. A. Mitta's How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor 1976) and steer clear of this mistake. ,negative
 Any time a movie feature a dwarf or a midget in a prominent role the odds are 10-to-1 that the director threw him in because he didn't know what else to do to keep the movie interesting. In this case the featured little guy isn't all that bad - he manages to keep his dignity for most of his scenes (except the part where he drags the leading man down the stairs of the dungeon) but the movie itself uses him like a doggie chew toy. The problem here is a common one with low budget exploitation movies - there's a germ of a decent idea in here but the director and the screenwriter don't know how to develop it. A good director would take the various story elements - brain transplants mad doctors with secret labs and a dungeon car chases fist fights dim-witted monstrous Frankenstein style assistant mind control betrayal and conspiracy etc...and make an exciting involving film full of cheap thrills and fun. Instead what we get here is a bunch of people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab then a cheesy operation where the patient bleeds tempura paint followed by some of the same people stumbling around and arguing in the doctor's lab some more followed by another subgroup of the initial group driving around and having an accident followed by a dungeon escape scene that is mostly about a woman putting her shoes back on followed by a rooftop chase (the actual high point of the movie) followed by a confusing series of events where everyone in the movie apparently escapes from everyone else followed by a lovely stroll in the countryside where everyone either chases bumps into attacks or escapes from everyone else AGAIN followed by well not much else. Somewhere in here is a scary peroxide blonde dressed in white a well meaning heroic type who is sort of blandly good looking a three foot lab assistant a big lunk with a mass of melted rubber pasted to one side of his face a kid who wonders into the middle of the movie to provide more of the frankenstein factor a brunette who sort of falls in love with the hero for no apparent reason and the mad doctor himself who must be the luckiest man in the history of evil super-villains because nothing goes according to his plan but things work out for him anyway... and all because he remembered to stick an electrode into the transplanted brain at one point in the operation. This was by no means the worst movie I've seen or even the worst exploitation movie I've seen or even the worst badly made exploitation movie I've seen but it just lies there oozing cheapness and inattention to detail at every point and there is no real reason for even bad movie enthusiasts to watch it. ,negative
 This piece of garbage belongs in the basement of some moldy old mansion where it will never see the light of day again. The only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission. I was only amused when the ending credits started rolling and I was free to vacate the auditorium. What an unmitigated bore; a complete waste of 1 and a half hours. When I die I pray I can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who penned this gibberish. ,negative
 Without doubt one of the worst films ever made. Sluggish and without structure tension or story the film coasts on the thin premise of putting together a show . Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their inception and dialogue is random and incidental. Everything is put together in a slapdash order and often Stepping Out feels more like a deleted scenes reel than an actual movie. The film seems to exist merely as a showcase for gaudy and totally random Liza musical numbers. Shelly Winters can be seen in the far superior octo-epic Tentacles and the REAL Liza can be found in the Showtime release of Queer Duck: The Movie . ,negative
 It had potential...it really did. But there is so much about the movie that was ridiculous and laughable. I'm a horror movie weenie and I thought it was stupid; as did my 13-year old! I was expecting to be at least creeped-out. And yes the gross-factor of the vines squirming in the people was there; however the lead-up to getting to the ruins is just dumb dumb dumb. I mean really who goes on a hike...in a jungle... with a total stranger... with a little water and a few snacks...IN FLIP FLOPS NO LESS?! Puh-lease! Better still who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or being able to speak a bit of the language? Are these people complete morons? The German's brother isn't heard from and he doesn't call for assistance? Who doesn't do that? He just finds some Greeks and Americans to go on a little search and find? ,negative
 I think Homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this movie - more like Plantation Grown - but it doesn't have quite the same ring to it. My guide described it a comedy but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh. More in the genre of the farcical thriller/drama. The characters developed well enough - an all-star cast made it oh-so promising just a shame the plot was patently absurd. Ted Danson provided a fine cameo as did Jamie Lee Curtis in her walk-on part. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of his car! I guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this one - not for the gun shy paranoid types though. ,negative
 From Kreestos: The dialog is terrible awful drivel. Acting poor. Many plot flaws. I don't recommend this at all. From Wikipedia: Artistic licenses The working manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [1] both of whom were male not female as depicted in the film. The copyists neither contributed to nor altered the score. In fact they were berated by Beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score. The movie is set in 1824 during the composition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Throughout the movie Beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. In reality Beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The Ninth Symphony was composed at a time when Beethoven's hearing had deteriorated severely. At this point in his life most of Beethoven's conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks. It can be argued however that he was also able to read people's lips evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him. In the film Beethoven makes an allusion to the Moonlight Sonata. This is an anachronism as the Sonata No. 14 quasi una fantasia was not named Moonlight until several years after his death. ,negative
 Lone Star Productions sure churned them out in the 1930's and Star Packer has the feel of one of the more rushed ones. John Wayne is U.S. Marshal John Travers investigating a crooked hoodlum known only as The Shadow responsible for stealing cattle stage holdups and the like and giving orders from behind the door of a phony wall safe. Yakima Canutt is Travers' trusty Indian sidekick appropriately named as... well Yak . Early on we find out that Cattlemens Union head Matt Matlock (George pre-Gabby Hayes) is really The Shadow; the dead giveaway is when he offers to buy out his (supposed) niece Anita's half of the Matlock Ranch since this is no place for a girl . As Anita Verna Hillie doesn't have much to do in the film although in a comic moment she gets to use a six shooter to blast the butt of one of the villains in a night time scare raid. There are a few curiosities in the film - for one Wayne's character alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film. In what could have been a neat device a hollowed out tree stump used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street. And finally the movie doesn't truly live up to it's name as Sheriff Travers never wears a badge throughout the film that is a star packer without a star. The horse chases the runaway stage scenes the stagecoach off the cliff (another curiosity the horses conveniently get loose from the stage) are all pretty standard stuff. But John Wayne fans will want to see this one for the charisma he displayed early on in his career. For those more critical the white kerchiefs worn around the forehead by the good guy posse could only mean that they all had a headache. ,negative
 The 3rd and last big screen spin off from the very popular ITV sitcom of the early 1970's HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is every bit as resistible and crude as the previous two efforts and observing from a standpoint three and a half decades later it is truly mind boggling that even one film was produced in this franchise. What constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of Stan Butler (Reg Varney) his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) and their bumblingly autocratic Inspector Blake (Stephen Lewis) after their sackings from their regular jobs at the bus depot.They all find work in similar positions at a holiday camp with Stan's family (Doris Hare Anna Karen Michael Robbins) following therewith. British cinema had a deserved and considerable reputation for high quality in the 1960's but much of this was due to American financial support and guidance which sadly drew to a close as the 1970's dawned.Thereafter notable homegrown titles (GET CARTER being the among these very few exceptions) became as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage and UK cinema went down the road of cheap budgets sleazy and witless sex comedies (The CONFESSIONS series COME PLAY WITH ME) and flabby elongated celluloid versions of various TV shows mostly sitcoms (this being one of many hideous examples).Only DAD'S ARMY and PORRIDGE came off fairly respectably in this regard;the quirky success of the first ON THE BUSES film (it was the biggest box-office hit of it's year in 1971 nonsensical to think now!) led to two further sequels. To be fair the TV series itself had a cheerful ripe non-PC vulgarity about it which was reasonably tolerable in half-hour sitcom form but stretched to three times that length it taxes the patience beyond belief.It's ironical that HAMMER FILMS produced this effort as it virtually resembles a horror film in the literal sense with ancient puns hackneyed poorly-timed slapstick and awful seedy production values. A chance to send up the cheesiness of the British holiday camp is totally wasted here in favour of the above elements and it is most bizarre if not gruesome to see the obviously 50-something Varney and the beaky-nosed long-toothed Grant managing to instantly charm young women barely in their early twenties while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes.The presence of Wilfrid Brambell (from STEPTOE AND SON) romancing the aged Miss Hare does not help matters either and even though the film lasts about 1 and a half hours it drags on to an interminably depressing degree. Thankfully this was the last film in this most dire of film trilogies and the TV series itself came to an end around the same time with a sequel (DON'T DRINK THE WATER which was roundly savaged by the critics and ignored by audiences) following in 1975.Most of the leading actors involved were not seen much afterwards but the worst affected was Bob Grant.Afflicted with depression and other mental problems for many years he committed suicide in 2003.A sad coda to a sitcom that was the most popular of it's era (it has not aged too well either) and should have remained that way rather than the three financially successful but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids which diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of it's TV counterpart. RATING:2 and a half out of 10. ,negative
 There's nothing to say except I want my time back that this movie took from me. I'm not racist against Latinos. Hell I'm half Brazilian. I loved the movie Kids. It doesn't make any sense. These kids just go around and do nothing. They're not even good at skating. The whole time I'm just waiting for something anything to happen! but it doesn't. NOTHING happens the whole movie. Did I mention they suck at skating. I might make a movie called beat up rockers and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh*t out of poser moron punks like these kids. I'm not even going to get into it this movie sucks. Please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake. ,negative
 SPOILER AHEAD! The mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) is on the loose in a New England college town searching for a college student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved Princess Ananka. Dull slow (even at 65 minutes--it moves slower than the mummy!) indifferently acted but the ending is worth waiting for. The mummy gets the girl (!!!!!) and she ages rapidly as the both slowly sink in a swamp. This is (I believe) the only time in a Universal monster movie that the monster got the girl! That aside this is stricly amateur night. Probably the worst of the mummy sequels--and that's saying something! ,negative
 There's something intriguing about disaster movies. The simple primal premise can lead to several great stories. Granted most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but I can usually live with that. Unfortunately Flood probably marks the low point in the history of this sub-genre. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie even though screen time is split between different locations and characters. He gives a barely decent performance. As well Joanne Whalley is very uneven. Veteran actor Tom Courtenay (he played in Doctor Zhivago for heaven's sake) is particularly bad. I mean his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor. What an embarrassing performance for that man. The rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig whom I thought might be there as a plot device/eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance. Doesn't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared. The script is really bad confusing and cliché. Some of the worse lines I have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other.You've seen this story a thousand times. It employs every dramatic hook and tear-jerkers you've seen in Outbreak Armageddon the Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others. The direction is awful. No sense of timing nothing inspired. The shots are bland dialog and action both fail to flow. Editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess? Without a doubt this movie tried to rely way too much on (rather poor) CGI. The human factor the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over. Scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done. The made-for-TV feel gives nausea. Some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter? No problem let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut/editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground in the most obvious way possible. The movie score is rather poor. All over the place no timing. The ending is probably the worse I have seen in quite some time. Very much like they ran out of ideas. Scrap that you can't run out of something if you never had it in the first place. Must have ran out of budget. This is a really amateur job. I give it a 2 for using London as a location which is a nice change for Gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few CGI shots that were decent (those of the water closing in on London and the gates). Do yourself a favor and check out Day After Tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one. This includes older classics like The Towering Inferno. ,negative
 This is a disappointing adaptation of the James Lee Burke novel In the Electric Mist of the Confederate Dead . It is rather poorly acted mainly due to the miscasting of the principal players. Tommy Lee Jones a normally fine actor just doesn't capture Burke's Dave Robicheaux . As Robicheaux's main nemesis John Goodman does a sloppy job as the heavy . The guy who plays Robicheaux's actor-buddy doesn't look like a former A lister leading man. The rest of the movie is mainly cast with no-name locals who just don't do justice to a big-time novel. The movie and Jones' performance is way too hurried for one thing. Robicheaux in Burke's series of novels gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time being laid back and slow-moving. This is just like the deep south and southern Louisiana. Then at times Robicheaux is nearly manic in his exertions. Jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie. He doesn't vary. Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. About the only good thing about this is the setting. On the whole the movie gives one the impression of a TV movie. ,negative
 go get your camcorder your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons; and you got yourself a film! well that's what these guys thought anyway. it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in 'Nam. despite the really corny title the horrible quality the terrible actors and the cliché writing i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen. i'm saving that slot for everything with steven seagal chuck norris and jean-claude van dam. anyhow if you are out of options when it comes to finding new horror films that you haven't seen 1 000 times already (as i was) and you are debating this one i would still skip this. it had absolutely no redeeming qualities. this mock serial killer thriller was a weak puny attempt at an even B film. if they're really lucky it might make the wal-mart $4.50 bin. but i highly doubt it. ,negative
 This movie was on the pay channels today and I had nothing to do so I had it on. This has to be the worst football movie ever made. This has to be one of the worst movies period. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system and they gave 2 stars out of 4. This movie isn't even a half a star. Bad acting Scott Bakula sinks as usual Larry Miller?? Sinbad couldn't act if he tried. Rob Schneider's one liners completely stunk. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see Kathy Ireland nude in the shower not even close. A complete waste of time and of film. If we could give a negative number minus 9. ,negative
 Words cannot describe how horrible this movie is. Well maybe they can. I'll take a stab at it: 1 - Pitiful. Hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics. Apparently script and storyline aren't needed anymore. 2 - Violent. Kids movie but yet one of the characters is viciously attacked and killed. 3 - Blatantly stupid. The movie is actually depicting the farm animals as having human abilities. In Nemo the fish could talk but for the most part they are still fish. We only hear the English as a translation. In Barnyard the animals are actually speaking English that other people can understand. 4 - Unintelligent - No smart story line or even any smart humor. (Ok the 13 year old dog on crutches was funny). 5 - Culturally insensitive - The black cow is actually played by a black actress. The pink cow is played by a white actress. The black cow was playing a stereotypical black person. 6 - Ignorant - No such thing as a male cow that I'm aware of. I believe we call them bulls? If we are going to expose our children to drek it might as well have the simplest facts correct. 7 - Boring and Borish. My 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes. He practically fell asleep. I'm sure this movie will make millions which is unfortunate because it only proves to Hollywood producers that the American public at large is just filled with suckers waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two. An unfortunate circumstance. Why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way. ,negative
 This is the kind of film that I am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning. This is the kind of movie that I cannot understand how people put money in it how the rental store can put the DVD on its shelves. This is the kind of movie I blame myself for having rented it. There are good class-B movies and I do not reject the genre. When they are good they catch the interest with the action they have characters written well enough and acted well enough so that you can care about them. The effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases and you may like them for the originality. Almost nothing is true in 'Coronado'. The subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics - just a cliche. The effects are cheap - and I do not care that the film is low budget - you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent. There are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films. You do not care for the characters you do not laugh and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery there are some good locations worth a much better film. 2/10 on my personal scale. The worst film of the year so far. ,negative
 I'm all about the walking dead but my mind is still unsure of the walking frozen dead. Sadly THE CHILLING didn't help me make up my mind. This is really slow with nothing happening for the first 45 minutes making me hit the film enhancement button several times. By the time the well designed zombies show up it is too late and the director (two are rumored to have filmed this) has no idea how to shoot them. Haggerty Blair and Donahue all look tired/embarrassed/recovering in some fashion. I will give the film credit as it predates the T2 ending with villains being frozen by liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD offers an extended promo reel from back in the day that runs 8 minutes long and I would actually recommend that over watching the flick in its entirety. ,negative
 I don't know why they even kept the name. How they could call the series 'The Scarlet Pimpernel' after they deviated from the novels so much I wouldn't have a clue. The character names are the only things they kept and even then they changed a few of those and mixed them up and changed Percy's relationships with them. Admittedly I only watched about two hours at the most of it but that was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like Baroness Orzcy had portrayed her characters and probably would have been rolling around in her grave when it was filming and airing. Poor lady. I hope that when the next person wants to make a movie/series of the book they don't ruin it as completely as this series did. ,negative
 Heart of Darkness Movie Review Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is pretty dark deep and very profound. I would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie. The character Mr. Kurtz played by John Malcovik was totally the wrong actor to do the part. He fit the character in Of Mice and Men. The movie left out man key parts that I consider important to get the true message of the story. The movie is poorly edited. It shows a lot of non-important and annoying flashes. In the novel it has a very suspenseful atmosphere but in the movie it lacks that kind of feeling. In the book there is so much that was left to the imagination of the reader. For example when Marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie. In the novel Marlow waited very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat. This was a big source of futility in the novel. The movie added more parts that were useless and kind of didn't make sense. For example when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him. That kind of just ruined everything didn't make any sense to me what so ever. So my suggestion to you is don't view the movie just read the book. You will understand more and have a better interpretation of the story. ~Chris C. ,negative
 Brainy cross-dressing little boy finds success on the Spelling Bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing. Shirley MacLaine directed and stars as the child's grandmother and it is always fascinating to see long-time actors getting their chance at directing a film the material that they're drawn to and the actors they choose to work with. Here the only person well-cast in Bruno is MacLaine. The child actors seem to have been picked for their twinkle and cuteness and squishy-hearted MacLaine holds their close-ups for excruciatingly long periods; nothing about these cherubs seems natural not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other. As the boy's disgruntled father poor Gary Sinise hovers around the edges in mock shame always with a pained look on his face. Towards the end of the film MacLaine turns the whole thing into a passel of hugging scenes and even concludes with the kid hugging the Pope in Rome! Another ungodly treatise from a talented actress-turned-director who much like Sally Field and her film Beautiful cannot seem to stop winking at and nudging the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity for shtick and childhood innocence as a punchline. The children in this cast roll their eyes crack wise with mature comments use big words--but when one mealy-mouthed boy calls our pint-sized hero gay MacLaine's granny instructs him to go over and punch the kid out (in front the media!). How's that for progression? * from **** ,negative
 With a cast of mostly lesser-tiered stars (Alain Delon Robert Wagner Eddie Albert) lousy special effects (sure it was the 70's but Alien and Star Wars came from the same decade) and a storyline that is so laughable that one might want to cry this is a flight that should have been GROUNDED. Even Academy Award winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy can't keep this bird airborne. The implausibility of the third film - airplane is submerged in The Bermuda Triangle - is much more believable than this turkey. Avoid The Concorde at all costs! ,negative
 Oh If any day u wanna see a supernatural thriller turning out to be a comedy watch this movie This film was a shocker as it had so many actors in it but what they do and how they fit in? The handling of the college scenes is like a school play where each person comes talk and then the next person comes infront Okay reasons to laugh at the film: 1) Akshay Suneil Aditya Panscholi Sharad Kapoor Arshad Warsi as college students 2)Akshay carries a gun in college 3) some pathetic stunts and SFX there are several more flaws like why doesn't the snake save his lover from being raped and comes in so late? also why he doesn't kill all of them together there only? But afterall they have to make a 2 hrs + film so hence you have a tortorius movie The movie is painful to watch The film was directed by Rajkumar Kohli who was an expert making such films in the past and had a successful record of films like JAANI DUSHMAN(1979) and NAGIN Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's non existent career Right from VIRODHI(1992) Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR(1996) all flops he tried hard to promote his son and he also casts big stars so that his son gets noticed sadly nothing could help his son's career The film has several comical scenes like the death scenes how the actors after being bashed by the snake are so fit to fight him again and the climax Direction by Rajkumar Kohli is bad Music is bad That brings us to the cast Akshay Kumar - ordinary stuff he has nothing much to do rather then stunts Suneil Shetty- awful Sonu Nigam- the worst debutante award goes to him he gives cartoon acting a new meaning Aftab- terrible Arshad Warsi- nothing to do Sharad Kapoor- bad Aditya Panscholi- irritates Sunny Deol- is comical in the scene when he comes to save Sonu LOL Manisha Koirala- ordinary Rambha- Akshay's pair Kiran Kumar Raza Murad are as usual Raj Babbar- hilarious for wrong reasons the girls are awful Which brings us to Munish Kohli This guy has a huge physique he is even more stronger and taller then Akshay Kumar Sadly he comes across as poor man's Akshay His voice is awful his expressions are painful The only thing he has to do in the movie is wear glasses and make an evil face Rajat Bedi is awful ,negative
 I have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely. It's burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never really seems to make much sense especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts having his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never really did figure that out.) Jones was OK in his role although I thought he was really starting to show his age here. Horribly miscast was John Goodman as Julie Baby Feet Balboni who I guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure. I simply didn't think Goodman worked in this role although I'll admit that just could be because I'm not much of a John Goodman fan. Somewhere in the mix appeared Justina Machado as an FBI agent although I never really did understand what the FBI was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen. If it was explained though I missed it completely. Fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you won't waste too much of your life on it. 2/10 ,negative
 The film begins in Latvia just after WWI. Being a history teacher I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests. However some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called Whites win. However the Whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between. Because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign armies the whole expedition was doomed and left the USSR after only a year or two. However what I did NOT know was that German troops were also involved. This surprised me as they had just lost WWI and weren't in the best shape to be mounting such an expedition. This is the backdrop for the film but it's also about a pro-Communist rich lady and her ill-fated love for a childhood friend who is among the German troops. She throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he rebuffs her. So she then sublimates these desires by various affairs. While none of this sex is all that graphic this and the underlying reason the man isn't interested make this a rather adult film and one I wouldn't show to younger audiences. While the setting for this film is interesting the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any I have seen. I don't recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated German films. I especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression as it will no doubt make it worse. The simple fact is that there are so many better German films out there waiting to be seen--such as MOSTLY MARTHA DAS BOOT MOTHER KUSTERS GOES TO HEAVEN WINGS OF DESIRE or ALI FEAR EATS THE SOUL (among others). ,negative
 Post 1988 after the disaster GJS Amitabh's films lost the quality they had earlier Barring MAIN AZAAD HOON released in 1989 which was a great film rest all films were craps mostly except HUM(1991) later in 1991 This is another of the crap Amitabh films people rejected in early 90's The film he did like a friendship token to Shashi Kapoor who directed the film and he didn't take a penny The film also had Rishi and Dimple(again not paired opp each other after RANBHOOMI) The film came in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops amongst them INDRAJEET AKAYLA AJOOBA Ajooba came 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR both supernatural films which were rejected This is another type of crap Bachchan wears a mask and a Krissh type outfit and performs magic changing 1 person to a donkey.etc Of course being 1991 you can excuse the special effects but the film is too bad to be watched Direction by Shashi Kapoor is not good Music is bad Amongst actors Amitabh had become too old by 1991 and looked tired his acting is okay but not on par with his best Rishi is okay Dimple is alright rest are forgettable ,negative
 Hilariously inept - like She Wore A Yellow Ribbon remade by five-year-olds. Spoilers ahead: Despite its title and the high bodycount Slaughter Trail is in fact a musical with Injun battles instead of dance numbers. If you ever wondered what Ed Wood might have done with a B-movie budget this film should answer your question. Some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect such as filming in the short-lived Cinecolor process which resulted in faces changing hue within the same shot. But there was definitely some ill-advised skimping on the film's main set a cavalry fort that seems to be partly a Norman castle. Terry Gilkyson who later wrote the 'The Bare Necessities' for Disney's The Jungle Book supplies a score full of original ditties which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit Western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup. One song tells how horse hooves pound and their melody sounds like the hoofbeat serenade ...during a dead-serious scene of a cavalry patrol. Other songs literally narrate the story shot by shot introducing characters describing their moods and gestures - as they happen on screen - and even stop to advertise the Cinecolor process(!) The script sends ferocious Navajos on the warpath to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio. By the end of the film what looks like a hundred Navajos and cavalrymen have bitten the dust (thanks to repeated footage of the same characters dying over and over.) But the chief is satisfied once he sees the trio of badguys have been slain. As the singer helpfully informs those of us who weren't paying attention the Navajos ride away their battle called off. The cavalry captain surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades cheerily waves his appreciation. The direction could most charitably be described as wooden or more to the point Wood-en. Navajos are consistently shot off their horses in pairs -- never just one. Virtually every red man on foot dies by throwing his hands in the air and keeling over. The film also employs the most cautious stuntmen in Hollywood who crouch before dropping off a one-story roof (and still fail to stick the landing) or turn to look behind them as they slide dead down a rocky slope. The star is Brian Donlevy who surely deserves an Oscar for not blushing. After the endless final battle scene -- climax is scarcely the word -- he scans a list of the dozens of his troopers killed and shrugs It could've been a LOT worse. Trooper Andy Devine gets to sing and robber/murderer Gig Young laughs at Andy's antics...which leads a character who had been held up by masked bandits to rat Gig out: I'd know that laugh anywhere! And lest anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work Howard Hughes could be recall that as head of RKO Hughes was first in line to blacklist original star Howard Da Silva when HUAC denounced him. It would take Hughes another six years to finish running that once-celebrated studio into the ground but it didn't help things when he insisted on reshooting Da Silva's every scene for this film substituting Donlevy. It was nearly a decade before Da Silva was able to work in Hollywood again. But all things considered for getting him out of Slaughter Trail he should have sent Hughes a thank-you note. ,negative
 I think the Bone Snatcher should go after anyone associated with this movie. Watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were horrifying even remotely. If you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I'd read. I wish I had my money back. What a skunker. If you're looking for a horror movie that will hold your interest watch U Turn . It may be based on a kooky plot but it's full of those creepy scenes that keep you jumping from beginning to end. ,negative
 This movie deviated from the Bible and fell so below the bar of the 1956 movie. I hate that they replaced the 2006 movie over the traditionally seen 10 commandments. Moses looked like a criminal in this movie not like the kind looking man Charelston Heston in the 1956 movie. I will not waste my time again watching this movie. They tried so hard to modernize this movie in order to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera (and not a good one at that). I'm pretty sure that younger ones out there who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments may disagree with me but to each his own. Also it took them 10 years to make the first 10 commandments it probably took them 2 months to make this one. The special effects were not as amazing as the first one and after all these years with so much technology you would have thought they would have done better now. ,negative
 Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile. After finally getting the chance to see it last night I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's Exorcist: The Beginning look good but Dominion does just that. No wait...it makes it look like a GREAT film. Perhaps I got myself too excited about this movie and that contributed to the let down. After all the idea that Warner Bros. was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction. Plus I'm a huge fan of Stellan Skarsgard and in true fashion he gives a great performance despite the often ridiculous content of the film. On the other hand the supporting cast in this film is abysmal. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - blank stare and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous tone while Gabrielle Mann's Father Frances is just ridiculous. The effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously. This movie brought about more stifled giggling than anything else and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three-seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whimper it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either. I could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers but frankly I'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things I'd love to say. The saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give...a story about a priest who has lost his faith and then regains it after coming to terms with his troubled past...had huge potential especially with Skarsgard as leading man. Unfortunately for us that potential was wasted. Go and see this film only if you're really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version but don't expect to see a good film or you'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise be content with the version first released and move on. ,negative
 Half of the movie is is flashing lights and shaky camera. The rest is made up of predictable characters (think science vs. government 'know-how' vs. authority etc.) What is the worst aspect about this movie? Is it the cars being thrown around in the first 5 minutes is the horrible 'Russian' accent of the 'cosmonaut' is it the uninspired characters the poorly integrated Top 40 hits or the US will save the world vitriol? No. It's the fact that regardless of the sad ending - there is very little suspense in this movie - we basically know what's going to happen. The one good part of this movie: American components Russian components: all made in Taiwan!  ,negative
 Dogmatic as another reviewer described this film is a fitting word. The director's idea was to present Bach without plot acting fun theatrics dialog narrative or drama. Mission accomplished Monsieur Straub. Pretentious? Yes. Cinematic? No way. This is anti-cinema. No one moves. Hardly anyone talks. The camera holds static shots for 10-12 minutes at a time: very very occasionally the camera will dolly in. You may catch a glimpse of Gustav Leonhardt's fingers moving over the keys. That's it. If you like the idea of staring at the back of a harpsichordist's (bewigged) head for 7 minutes at a stretch while listening to Bach this is the film for you. I'd rather listen to Bach on my stereo with my eyes closed. ,negative
 4 Oscar winners Karl Malden Sally Field Shirley Jones Michael Caine. Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? Irwin Allen was just trying to cash in on the popularity of the original classic disaster film with a grade D minus script the actors were obviously just in it for the paycheck as well ... the horror the horror! How insane are the characters that Caine Savalas Malden and Field are playing? Go into a potentially deadly sinking ship that's 1. on fire 2. Hot from steam 3. Slippery from water and oil 4. boilers that are exploding every 5 minutes etc. all for the love of money? Greed? 5. They have very little equipment not even a pair of gloves or work boots in sight much less a grappling hook rope etc. Stupidity! What were they thinking? Peter Boyle overacts so much that I just wanted to smack him! Stop it! And what's the deal with the bad toupee? Also there is no way you can believe his character was a WW2 veteran. Caine Field and Malden find all that gold and money and they are happy--whoopee! We're rich! (We may not live to spend it but hey...) And yee haw it's the great character actor Slim Pickens! Survivors galore! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight too! The final dramatic sub plot about that scary plutonium never really went anywhere it's like they forgot sort of? Lots of holes in the script. This film has an illness that the strongest pill couldn't cure. I'm surprised Alan J. Smithee's name wasn't on the script I'd be embarrassed to have penned this one! Oh the insanity Oh The humanity! Oy Vey! The Horror The Horror! It's like a bad two hour TV movie. At least the sets were made from recycled material from the first movie. The script needed to be on the compost heap... ,negative
 German emigree and uber-hambone actor Paul Muni who never saw a scene he didn't want to chew up goes blackface to play a humble Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles and working his way up in the world. If this creaky vehicle reminds anyone of Al Pacino's minstrel performance as an uncultured Cuban in the remake of SCARFACE don't be too surprised. The characters are quite similar and both get wildly pop-eyed when the script calls for it. Hispanics everywhere should be greatly offended by Muni's over-the-top performance as this giddy Mexican living the American dream consequences be damned. I guess Benicio DelToro's grandfather wasn't available. A young bleached-blonde Bette Davis plays one of Muni's love interests; she eventually goes insane for love of Mr. Meh-hee-can Muni. An absolute hoot Davis is the sole reason to watch this racially offensive claptrap. There is an absolutely delirious near the end when Muni asks the gal of his dreams to marry him -- a white gal of breeding with one of those stilted stage-like '30s accents that Hollywood loved so much -- and she calls him a savage and a brute of a different tribe. Muni immediately transforms into Mr. Hyde and chases her to an untimely death. In the final scene a repentant Muni tells his sober-faced priest that he is going back to his own people his own kind. End of movie. Finis. That's all she wrote. Muni was said to have hired a gen-oo-ine Mexican as a chauffeur in order to study this exotic creature's speech pattern and physical habits. Yowza! ,negative
 Sure most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth the celluloid they were filmed on but this video nightmare may well be the dullest produced. Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course and you know this already they begin getting killed one by one by a mysterious stranger. The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzard bait. John Carl Buechler my least favorite B-movie guy did the lousy makeup effects here. The cast features Carel Struycken of The Witches of Eastwick and the Addams family movies. Sadly he does not pop up until the very end of the film and is covered in burn makeup rendering him unrecognizable. Steve Bond (anyone remember him?) is here in an early role as a victim. Brown's direction and the script he cowrote both smell like the presents brown bears leave in the woods. He pads the film with so much stock wilderness footage I thought I accidentally rented a special episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Much of the cast sits around the campfire and eats then walk and sit and eat again. The forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put in a slasher film: he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to a baby deer. Jackie Coogan who must have forgot he once worked with the legends of silent cinema has two scenes and is involved in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film: he and the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread...yeah. There is not one minute of suspense here. The killer a forest fire survivor looking for a mate watches the students from behind trees. We know it is the killer because the film makers have dubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wake the viewer up every few minutes. Skip this pile of pine sap and rent Halloween instead. This is rated (R) for physical violence mild gun violence gore some profanity brief female nudity mild sexual content sexual references and drug abuse. ,negative
 Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! Wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. Everyone in this movie should attend Overactors Anonymous. You would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the Pearl Harbor bombing. It does raise interesting questions but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke. The typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd (glasses included). I could not have been more uninterested in the wooden dialog and cliché characters. Upon the completion of the movie I had to throw the DVD in the trash. Stay far away from this dud! You won't get the 90 minutes of your life back! ,negative
 Although I rarely agree with filmkrönikan I have to say that this film while not awful just didn't make me care at all... and it all just seemed to be out of place... it had its moments... three or four ones that made me snicker... but most of the time I was just sitting and wondering why? why did the characters do this? even Hot Shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed out... If you want to see a nice norrlands-film then watch Pistvakt. There it was more than random ethnicities that just walked around shooting each other on the Swedish tundra... I am so disappointed... ,negative
 If you are thinking of going to see this film then my advice is - dont. For me the film failed to make the grade at every level and was a reminder of how dire most British (& Irish)films are. Forgettable tripe is the best i can say. If it had been on telly l would have wandered off to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. I saw this film with a group of friends and having read the press previews went along prepared to not be critical and hopefully pass an amusing 90 minutes. But oh dear..... As a comedy it wasn't funny as a thriller the stupid story was sloppy and lazy. As a love story totally unbelievable. Most of all as a piece of 'gloriously over the top whimsy' it lacked both style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they needed to do to earn their money playing er..... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me but other than playing east end gangsters and jack the lads does Michael Caine leave you cold? In fairness some of my friends thought it was 'ok' but if you do go my advice is have a few drinks (or puffs) beforehand and leave your critical faculties safely locked up at home. ,negative
 Hellraiser: Bloodline is where the sequel mediocrity of the Hellraiser series well and truly sets in. Gone is the imagination and invention of the first two movies. Gone is the ethos of Pinhead and his minions. Gone are the sick desires of humans. In fact everything that once made Hellraiser so original has been trashed by this mess of a picture. All that is left is that basic premise of Christian mythology that there is a Hell with evil Demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This watered down excuse for a Hellraiser movie is padded out with endless Psycho Babble so that Pinhead becomes a nonsense spouting philosopher and not the harbinger of doom as he is meant to be. The film uses the most basic of film formulas with characters separating and getting individually killed. Pinhead is not Alien. The link between the box and the 'demons' or 'Hell' is never established it just arrives at a sacrifice and sits on a sideboard. The lead female Character is called 'Rimmer' and the producers obviously think it really funny because everyone keep saying her name. Really the film should have been retitled to give it that characters name. Shame on you Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee. ,negative
 After just viewing the movie I must say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This takes my worst movie award away from Komodo which is no easy feat. It is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. The acting camera-work plot script and sound are all awful. My personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was a joke such as this put in the film? Was the director thinking; I need a humorous scene to balance out the great acting so I will use some lame ass joke I read on a Laffy Taffy wrapper. Another retarded part is when Norman spills the invisibility potion on himself as he attempts to keep it from spilling. Why did they even bother to give the film a NC-17 rating were they hoping to get as large of an audience as possible? At least if it were rated X it would be more sexual and therefore taking the viewers focus away from the overall low quality. I pray for someone who worked on this panty waste of a flick to respond. ,negative
 Eleven years ago Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now eleven years later it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie Son of the Mask. Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds Cuz I gotta! Unfortunately that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking Good Lord Why? Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party. The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim played by Jamie Kennedy is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog jealous of the baby's attention puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile Loki played by Alan Cumming is in search for his mask at the orders of his father Odin. First off ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time. The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing but in this movie the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch and what's worse they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while obviously computer animation was used so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey we were convinced was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying. The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods or whoever for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question WHY? The son of the Mask gets one star although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey who will always be in my book the mask. ,negative
 When you watch a Seagal movie you expect good action. You expect fighting not just a lot of shooting like in this flick. And: you expect a rather simple story. OK I can live with a more complex story even though it's a Seagal movie. But this one this is I don't know what to say. It's very very confusing indeed. At the end of the movie I had major problems figuring out what had happened. And I know I'm not the only one. The story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that it's nearly impossible to keep track of what's happening in the movie. There are many people in the movie people change sides all the time and it switches locations too often. Terrible. I just don't understand why it looks like Seagal is making a sort of sequel to this one. ,negative
 In the 1930s Hal Roach Studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as Laurel and Hardy Charley Chase and the Little Rascals. Most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time. However a lesser-known Roach product was the pairing of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later Todd was paired with the equally untalented Patsy Kelly). Try as I might I just can't stand these pictures--they just aren't funny. Plus unlike Laurel and Hardy there was not an ounce of chemistry between Todd and her two co-stars. Before you just think I am a crank understand that I have seen and reviewed several hundred Roach films as well as many other early comedies so I am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre this team is among the worst. Part of the reason I think I am right about the team is that as a lower-tier team at Roach they were given all the scripts no one else wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated a given plot idea it was often given to Todd and Pitts/Kelly--and usually it showed. In this film however the team is at their absolute lowest. It's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot. The film begins with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as a defense lawyer. As for Zasu she's a completely annoying moron. NOT the lovable type moron (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello) but just a totally annoying and grating person who is pushy and obnoxious. As for Thelma as usual she's the rather bland straight man and as such has little to do but react to Zasu's boorish behavior. The plot involves Thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills. Considering that the pills are highly dangerous when the attorney asks Zasu to try swallowing one it just seems dumb. And while they were called pills they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls. Swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense--even for a low-brow comedy. When they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends. As I said I am not a fan of this team. However even for those who want to like the film there isn't one legitimate laugh in the entire short! When I talked over this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me) she thought my score of 2 was overly generous!! ,negative
 Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend due to encountering the Krites Brad Brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile the Krite eggs begin to hatch. As they cause trouble in the town Brown & the townsfolk as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the town. The original Critters was a minor attempt to rip-off the family-horror flick Gremlins . It became a cult favourite on the video shelves & was successful enough to warrant a sequel. This sequel plays down the horror & makes its entire focus comedy instead. Unfortunately the comedy part is extremely clumsy as well as childish. The acting is on par with the rest of the film. It is just that the film suffers from a weak script. The visual effects are fairly well done. Grade: D+ Review by M. K. Geist. ,negative
 Silly Disney film about a college student who accidentally discovers a potion that makes things invisible. Not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good. Still the script is VERY bad...all the jokes flop and the acting is lousy. Everybody's trying to be funny and they're not. A real boring stupid Disney film. But it was fun seeing Kurt Russell so young. ,negative
 Saw this movie last night. I don't usually comment good or bad as I think movies are like books in that there is something for everyone and everyone is different tastes vary yadda yadda. This movie was bad. By the end I thought oh my this is testing my patience. How many women really look and live like this when they hit rock bottom and if I could just borrow some cash from mum and carry out to live my fashion designing dreams - gosh life would be great! I was out for a nice chick-date flick with my girl (my darling hubby likes watching movies together and I knew this wouldn't be his thing) something light and easy on the senses but this was one bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting movie watchers and this movie wasn't that. Annette Benning is a great actress she held her own. Bad. Bad. ,negative
 After consuming Human Pork Chop and properly digesting it I felt urged and obliged to inform potential viewers that chewing on this product is NO FUN and its substance of LOW nutritive value. According to the dull nature of this film the following is gonna be a WARNING more than a REVIEW. This is the first time I wished that there is an I-don't-care-to-rate-this-movie -button on IMDB because the only reaction to this boring piece of TRASH is stasis and indifference. Every possible rating would do injustice to all the other items listed here a 10 is out of question anyway 1 might persuade some readers that this is one of those cases where it's so bad that it's actually REALLY bad and that's kewl! and 5 is unsatisfying as well people might think that it's an OK-flick and alright if you wanna have some cheesy fun which it is not... Honest to God it's neither a 10 a zero nor a 5 it's nothing a black hole A FUTILE WORK CONCEIVED BY AN EMBRYO. I bought the region 3 DVD which was cheap (7 bucks!!!) at least and of good picture-quality I bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own entry. Oh boy was I to be DISAPPOINTED. This movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor... it's not even laughable it doesn't take itself too serious to be laughed at but still serious enough so as not to be comic. A truly unpassionate amateurish effort. The only sequence that I found MILDLY DISTURBING is when two giggling thugs put an ugly dog in a bag and bash it against a brick wall... but even such a cruel premise only lead to a poor execution. The further down cited TOILET SCENE is unrealistic and filmmed without any sense for suspense suffering or humiliation - the feces look like painted marsh-mellows!!! There is a butchery scene at the end of a loooong 85-minutes where three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a setup which one finds also depicted on the front cover of the DVD) start to dispose of the female body. Reminded me of American Psycho and Shallow Grave now these flicks are worth watching and true masterpieces. Let's be REALISTIC for once and not rush to make a myth out of every Asian-wannabe-scary-movie as seems to happen lately... If you are looking out for some eastern horror then try Danny Lee's masterpiece of the very same (English) title Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao (Human Pork Chop) it's from 1992 and has - not without reason I might add - been compared to Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer . There is also a similar film telling the same story by a different film crew called Ren tou dou fu shang ( There Is a Secret in My Soup ) of the same year sort of a rival production. It's available as a region 3 DVD and by most regarded as superior to Peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang . I might add a few more words on the special effects... what special effects?!?... there are a few chopped off limbs they look awful - in a wrong sense - probably Made in Hong Kong . That's about all the info I can share on this subject hopefully it will prove helpful... ENJOY YOUR MEAL! ,negative
 Yagyu ichizoku no inbo (let's just say The Shogun's Samurai ) is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch. As an historical epic it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba. Before this movie's halfway point I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone). The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating. And in terms of action it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks. What a terrible movie. ,negative
 I love Brian Yuzna's other work even cruder stuff like 'Necronomicon' but 'Progeny' was too much even for me. My chief complaint is that it's needlessly exploitative of Jillian McWhirter's nudity I'm no prude but these nude scenes just drag on and on and on... only to culminate (virtually every time) in a tawdry *wink nudge* insinuation of sexual violence. The scene where she attempts a coat hanger abortion after several minutes of naked screaming is a prime example. Arnold Vosloo's 'performance' is utterly turgid but even Jeffrey Coombs couldn't save this festering heap of a film. The aliens are boring the uniformly dull lighting saps your interest and the plot is absolutely predictable. The only highlights for me were an all-too-brief glimpse of the aliens' true form (very nice model) and the scene where Vosloo finds his wife in the closet was OK too. But you've been warned. ,negative
 Nickelodeon has gone down the toilet. They have kids saying things like Oh my God! and We're screwed This show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking or aren't in the in crowd. It say that sexual promiscuity is alright by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys. Not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. The main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary. Carly's friend Sam who may be a lesbian beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path which says it's alright to be a b**ch. This show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it! I give it a 0 out of 10!!! ,negative
 I'm writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer. I watched the 1997 Kasparov-Deep Blue games on the Internet. I know something about the issues that were raised. Other chess players will come along and want to know whether this movie is worth seeing/buying and I'm talking largely to them. However I'll try not to ignore those who aren't into chess . This movie is about the 1997 match between Garry Kasparov and the custom-built computer Deep Blue . However the first image you see in the movie is not of Kasparov or of the computer but of THE TURK . This is an automaton which was built in Europe at the turn of the 18th-19th century and played winning chess against all comers. I put the word automaton in quotes because it was as everyone now knows a fake. There was a man inside it. If you don't like seeing THE TURK then you won't be able to stand the movie because THE TURK has as much screen time as Kasparov maybe more both in modern footage and in b/w footage from some old movie. The reappearance of THE TURK every few seconds underscores Kasparov's charge that Deep Blue had human assistance - that it was (to some degree) a fake computer that IBM cheated that there was a man inside it working behind the scenes to help it win. Not only does Kasparov believe this but the filmmakers seem to believe it too. And so this is not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers. It is a propaganda piece about a big corporation supposedly misusing a helpless grandmaster. Really it is a lot like a negative campaign ad as it is chock full of ominous music and evocative camera work and spooky sound effects and innuendos ( we never found out what was behind that locked door ) and the ever-present TURK . Now most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that IBM did not cheat and that this was Garry's paranoia at work. To start with in order for a human to help Deep Blue beat Kasparov it would seem that you would need a human who was better than Deep Blue AND better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start. Furthermore by the time this movie was made there were computer programs that could run on your PC that could beat strong grandmasters. Today much more than in 1997 we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect. And we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer beat a guy in chess. (And in fact the bottom line is that Kasparov beat himself with two bad mistakes including resigning game 2 in a drawn position.) As for the chess games you actually see very little of them. There are a few comments from masters and commentators that tell briefly how they went but really you don't get to see hardly any of the strategy or tactics at all. Naturally as a chess player I take this as a major shortcoming but I think that non-players are being cheated too. Imagine a baseball movie for example where you don't hardly get to see any of the game - just a commentator telling you that in Game Four the White Sox defeated the Astros with such and such a score. Nobody would make a movie like that. But here for example we are told that Kasparov made a bad blunder in the opening of the decisive game 6 but we aren't shown the position on the screen or told why it was a blunder or what he should have done instead or anything. We just see a few seconds of Kasparov holding his head in his hands and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work. (Since I saw this on DVD let me warn chess players about the DVD as well. The jacket promises you that the Extras include the games with analysis . Is this grandmaster analysis which people like us might find interesting? NO! It is the automated computer voice synthesizer analysis from some version of Chessmaster that tells you when a piece is attacked and a pawn gets isolated and that you are in the Caro-Kann Defense Main Line . Blahhhh.) Someone might then come along and say Well clearly this movie is meant to dramatize the match for the non-player and so it's unfair to be impatient with it. But actually it doesn't do a very good job of reaching out to the non-player either - it skates over some points that a true novice would really want to have explained. For example it says that Kasparov could have gotten perpetual check in the second game but it doesn't explain what that is (or show what it would have looked like on the board which would have been interesting). It flashes back to the Kasparov-Karpov matches but doesn't explain why there were two of them or who organized them etc. I didn't need this information myself but I'm familiar with it. If you don't already have chess experience there are places where you are going to be confused and this is just a defect in the film. Ultimately I can't recommend the movie which like THE TURK itself is not what it purports to be (a documentary) but more of a stage illusion. ,negative
 I gave this film a 2 mostly because it does actually have an ok cast but the film itself is just so (insert unusually rude word beginning with the sixth letter of the alphabet)-ing pointless that I felt bad that at the time I voted for it its lowest vote was a three. Very predictable plot....two nare-do-well musicians have no money and plenty of money problems. However when a friend leaves a bag full of money (that belongs to drug dealers) in their care they of course spend it and then the fun begins. Not an original idea in this whole film. ,negative
 Over acted heavy handed full of speeches preachy on the nose and over stylized in a way only MTV could be guilty of Stop-Loss is agit-prop garbage. I expected a lot more with talented young actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe but Screenwriter/Director Kimberly Peirce does a hatchet job of portraying the ill effects of war on American youth. I'm sure she did some work researching the Iraq war and the young men fighting in it but you'd never guess it from watching Stop-Loss. In many ways this mess reminded me of Catherine Hardwicke's Lords of Dogtown an equally inept overly stylized TV movie-like waste of solid subject matter. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/ ,negative
 This movie is so bad they wouldn't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought for the masterpiece Deadfall . The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four disc set but they wouldn't buy back Underworld and those other two movies redefined rank so what does that say about this movie? So I tried to sell it back to another store that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store but they wouldn't buy back Underworld either. This movie is bad on every level and is one of those that came out in the post-Tarantino-clone glut of the mid 90's. The only slightly redeemable element is Dennis Leary telling Joe Montegna that he's a stinky friend and calls him Mister Stinky Friend . That line is so delightfully horrible that I can't help but quote it at least once a week when describing a stinky friend. But now that I've enlightened you with that quote you don't have to go thru the pain of watching this movie. ,negative
 I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot dry and barren elements. The movie was dull boring completely incoherent from beginning to end pretentious and devoid of any conceivable plot. You had to be a psychic to follow the plot line or lack thereof. It had its moments sure; but so does going to the dentist. In short I'd much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again. It was so bad I actually couldn't fall asleep. There are quite a few Eurotrash movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision. This is one of them. On the bright side who is Nadia Cassini? Never before have I seen a more beautiful set of legs. She is the one saving grace of this movie. Disturbing too was the cruel boar hunt depicted in the closing credits. A boar that was released on someone's property (Malta has very few native mammals; all of them small - rats bats etc.) and then set upon by dogs before it was shot. Oh well - go visit Malta anyway despite this film - it's a beautiful colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun. ,negative
 This film is sometimes called 'The Story of O-Pt.2' which tries to pass itself off as a sequel (of sorts)to the French erotic S&M thriller 'The Story Of O'. Although I've never seen the original version I did however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual & social politics. I guess the 'O' angle comes from the occasional S&M overtones (which were never as explicit (and unpleasant to watch) as the ones in 'Mistress'. Klaus Kinski is the only recognizable face in this French/Japanese production (but speaks his lines in English--at least in the version I saw). The unnecessary use of surrealism only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even more pretentious (what are they trying to prove with depicting a piano floating in water?). It's obvious that after the whole porno chic trend in cinema petered out (ouch-sorry bad pun!)about 1975 producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the mavens of adult cinema not to mention Foreign/Art Cinema so film goers had to contend with dreck like 'The Last Woman' and others like it. ,negative
 After an undercover mission in Bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers the agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect the Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca) the widow of an accountant of the Romanian Mafia. However the CIA safe house is broken in by the criminals and Sonni realizes that the information was leaked from inside the Agency. Alone trusting only in his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope) Sonni fights to survive and protect Nadia. The career of Wesley Snipes is downhill. I have just seen this flick and it is another disappointing movie of this actor whose career is presently very similar to Steven Segal's one. The movie has many explosions shots and car chase associated to an awful story and horrible acting. First the Afro-American Wesley Snipes is chased by the police of Bucharest but they never find a black American man. I have never been in Romania but I believe there are not many Afro-Americans in this country. His character does not like to bath wearing the same clothes along many days. There is no chemistry between Sonni and the sexy Silvia Colloca but she freely has sex falls in love for him and shares her fortune with him. The boy that performs Nadia's son is horrible. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): O Detonador ( The Detonator ) ,negative
 Problem Child was an okay movie but did it really merit a sequel? I don't think it did. The original movie's only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried and he wasn't even good in this sequel. I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. For starters it just wasn't funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old I didn't sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came off to me as whiny self-loathing and perhaps most importantly a rebel without a clue. He appeared to hate every woman that his father Ben (John Ritter) dated for the sole sake of hating them. It also doesn't send a good message to kids with divorced parents (who constitute over half children in the U.S. these days) when the one woman Ben decides to (almost) marry is a Southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is. And as cool as I thought it would have been to see original SNL cast mate Laraine Newman come back to the big screen she couldn't even save this movie. I also found it strange that she was a white Southern débutante whose name was Lawanda. That sounds more like an African-American woman's name. But of course that has nothing to do with why I disliked this movie. I think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate along with protagonists you weren't supposed to hate. John Ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting. Instead he came off not only as a wimpy parent but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days regardless of how well he knew the woman. Did I mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents? In a nutshell the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included Amy Yasbeck unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character that young girl who was even more obnoxious than Junior completely uncalled for toilet humor and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (involving the dog catchers). The movie was just a mess and really doesn't deserve a DVD release if it hasn't been given one already. It should just rot on VHS along with all the other bad forgettable 90's comedies. ,negative
 I have seen this movie but not in a single sitting. What happens it that it is playing on the TV I watch for a few minutes find that I have take all that I can take and then leave the room. During those few minutes I do not laugh once experience no pleasure in what I am viewing and find myself more depressed that angry. Interestingly I am told the psychological states are incompatible that is one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. This movie tests that theory. I think part of the problem is that I spent nearly ten years in Chicago so as I am watching the scenes I am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus I am clearly bringing a lot of my baggage to the piece. It is entirely possible I am willing to concede that if you are not a Chicago denizen you will find the piece amusing. If so I envy you. And yet. John Hughes set his films in Chicago and those movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first rate writer. I think it obvious he knew how to comically balance his situations as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable. In a comedy (as distinguished from a farce) this balance vital. And it is not easy to achieve. If it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to fret as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear. In Adventures in Babysitting it doesn't. I hated those characters. There is a difference profound and real between sympathetic and simply pathetic. For me every scene in this movie is a clunker. There is no humor no humanity no people one can recognize. Just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to restrain themselves from screaming them out certain that finally hilarity will ensue this time for sure! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It's embarrassing and after a while usually at the point when I get up and leave I start to feel pity for all concerned which is a kind of emotional connection I suppose. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. She doesn't act certainly not act comically and it's entirely possible she can't. But lord how she tries. She looks older than 17 and acts way younger like a seven-year old straining in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award. And she is not alone. It is as if everyone cannot relax and let the tale flow. As if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing. Now this was an early effort for Chris Columbus and he clearly would improve and having better writers (e.g. John Hughes himself) certainly helped so perhaps some forgiveness is in order. But the film just reeks of desperation. Yet like I said it may work for some. If any of the above appeals to you and it clearly did some of the reviewers then go get the DVD and knock yourself out. Otherwise avoid this mess like you would a dark Chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats. ,negative
 Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point: the little Vasque town of Obaba. In this film the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange film as it has any main character (the movie spends about 20 min. to each tale) other than the town of Obaba. Any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain but well that's not saying too much. The only good thing of the film is the precious scenarios. It is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more enjoyable to spend the time watching the scenario rather than being aware of the story. ,negative
 Why I disliked the movie apart from the sheer ugliness of the actors themselves is that someone might actually believe such crap. First of all The Second Coming of Christ will be at the end of words and when Jesus Christ will come on Judgement day he will not come as He did before in human form. He will come in His full Glory as God and we shall be judged not only for our sins but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone will! Secondly I have seen the eternal Gay pride illustrated in this movie with the all unquestionable I read the Bible last night and it's not written anywhere . Well it is. Moses cites on 3 different occasions that men who make love to other men or women who make love to each other as if man and wife should be killed because these will never inherit the kingdom of God as they are foul! If it truly were for us to follow the Bible word for word there would be executions now wouldn't there? But I think misinforming people does more harm than this would... That was the in the Old Testament. There are lots of lunatics in psychiatric wards who think they are The Son of God but to make a movie after it truly makes you think of how many idiots out there can make a movie. ,negative
 The St. Francisville Experiment claims this ain't no walk in the woods a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say however that this is destined to be a camp classic. Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming!! I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's paranormal consultant Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie. Should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist read on my friends and all shall be told. Mr. Taylor a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true informed the audience at this video screening that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know... He informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers. Matter of fact he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana but rather in California. All four participants were true actors (notice I didn't say good...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician on ER. What infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true. It feebly attempts to outdo The Blair Witch Project by claiming it's true whereas Blair Witch was a hoax. The amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant. Filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as surround yourself with the white light and I love the ghosts The St. Francisville Experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle boo jeer and chant I love the ghosts! Talk about false advertising. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scouts troop set up a haunted house. From the bug in the sandwich (ooh...scary...) to the annoying Madison from the seance which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an Oujia Board to the two mice being found under a bed The St. Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be: The St. Francisville Experiment: A comedic look at how not to make a movie . ,negative
 I watched the first 10 minutes of this show I think I'm gonna barf now! One worst shows on TV. It's not even funny. It's so lame it's disgusting. I gave it a second and third change couldn't even make it through five minutes. Don't waste the time. This is one of the many shows that need to go bye bye. Speaking of regular night time shows that need to go. All the shows on CBS. All the Shows on ABC. All the Shows on FOX and Joe Buck. All the shows on the new CW network. All the shows on NBC.(Accept The Law and Order series). All the Morning and Afternoon talk shows. All the Court TV shows. And every reality show out there!! Every stupid game show. period the end! All the Home improvement shows! And all the Media News. all it is.Is a 24 hour loop of bad news. Yes I do have Favorites Monk The law & Orders thats it for me. ,negative
 We arrived at the theater too late to see Rendition which was our intention and 'The Comebacks' was the only film that hadn't already started. I had an inkling of how bad a film it was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter. The theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film started. The screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports cliché at the audience without creating a single laugh not one during the entire movie. Think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned. If you add Texas to the mix you ought to come up with the sports version of 'Little Miss Sunshine' not a big yawn. The first film that came to mind as we exited the theater was 'Can't Stop the Music' By comparison this was 'Can't stop the Music' without Bruce Jenner Valerie Perrine or the Village People. If the film had a single grace note it was seeing Matthew Lawrence grown up. ,negative
 I had read online reviews praising this obscure outing as a combination of gory horror quirky black comedy and borderline art-house; the film has elements of all three to be sure but they are at the service of such a supremely silly premise (the title immediately gives the game away)  and amateurish production to boot  that its long-term neglect due to a lack of proper distribution  basically until Cult Epics picked it up for DVD release a full 30 years after its inception!  was no great loss to cinema or even the genre(s). The bed was apparently created for the purpose of accommodating a demon's dalliance with a woman; anyway a dying man who had made use of the four-poster and even painted it ends up trapped in the wall behind the canvas(!) and provides intermittent commentary to the 'action'. Several people (from teenagers-on-a-fling to gangsters-in-hiding) supply fodder to the perennially-hungry bed; latest on the menu are a trio of girls  one of whom however recalls its mistress of long ago and consequently the bed seemingly fears her! Seeing various objects  from cigars to pieces of fried chicken  and people getting swallowed up (the belly of the bed is depicted as a vat of honey-colored liquid) makes the film mildly amusing at times (especially when a young man's hands are reduced to their skeletal formation which he seems to take rather too easily in his stride!) but also awfully repetitiousso that at even a brief 77 minutes the whole pointless exercise feels strained and downright desperate. ,negative
 I must say I was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an Adam Sandler Happy Madison production and I am usually attracted to that type of silly humour. There were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. The acting was horrible the cinematography was very poor the plot made no sense at all. I cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing. Overall I was very unimpressed with this film and I do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it. ,negative
 This movie plays out like an English version of an ABC after school special with nudity. It makes you wonder who the target audience was supposed to be. It's not as though the writers were too preoccupied with selling a plausible plot either. While it does possess a certain watchability Virtual Sexuality is fluffier than dandelion meringue. It's a good movie to watch if you're snowed in the cable's out and it's the only tape you've got. ,negative
 The first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the Willis character were pretty enjoyable especially with Jean Smart but it really tanked after that. This is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all. I know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self but I found this kid ESPECIALLY irritating and whinney. ,negative
 For a movie I was really looking forward to I was very disappointed. I had no expectations of this being another Amadeus but did expect a more significant portrayal of Beethovens last years. The performance by Ed Harris was superb but the story line was so weak that the film simply moved from one dreary scene to the next with no continuity. The only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th and from that point on I could quite happily have walked out without finishing. I left feeling very dissatisfied and still have the feeling that something important was missed. ,negative
 I couldn't even...I mean...look....okay... Wow. Not even a bunch of my drunk friends trying to make fun of the movie could enjoy themselves in the least bit. I can only think...how. How do independent film makers everywhere go years without getting noticed (or even their lives) and con-artists like the guy who made this get a DVD on a shelf? It seriously looks as if some guy with a home movie camera went out with some guys he met at Subway and made the worst thing he could think of. Hey guys give me some ideas. Start with a corn-field and work backwards. Well you've gotta have actors straight out of high school and some broken corn stalks with shreds of clothing attached. And boobs. Thanks guy I'm sure that you and Windows Movie Maker will be side by side on your next anxiously awaited project. ,negative
 The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free at college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free it's hopeless. Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie but I have never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents but I enjoyed it very much). It's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it. You want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with the Grinch. ,negative
 Mild spoilers below. The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Naziism will be the death of millions of Germans this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into America with Wayne's help. Other than the dust bowl scenes the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with hindsight. Coburn's speech comparing Naziism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the (then current) successes as a momentary outburst of energy from a patient right before death were eerily accurate and Varno's Dr. Scherer played accurately to post war newsreel footage of unrepentant Nazis justifying their actions. When viewed from a historical perspective some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at it for entertainment outside of the WWII perspective you'd have to say this is one of Wayne's less successful efforts. ,negative
 If you described any of the scenes; nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep your infant daughter talking to ghosts searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night so petrified with fear that you can't move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above  then I'd say you had a horror movie. But some how 'Wicked Little Things' just wasn't scary. I am a horror fan and I loved the location the plot in principal and I liked the three leading ladies. I didn't want to see them come to harm I wanted the 'bad guy' to get his just desserts the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so I was indifferent either way with them and it played out every cliché in the book - even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here whispering voices closing in on you. I would still recommend that you watch it but unless you are new to horror movies or under 12 years you will have seen it all before. ,negative
 Maybe it's unfair to dislike a movie for what it isn't rather than what it is but I approached this hoping that finally a filmmaker would make a movie about small-town rural gay men and women. Instead the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry (big news!) of the locals (and those in outlying areas) and the really gruesome torture/murder of a young gay man. So much time devoted to stupid people squawking about AIDS sin hellfire and perverts. So much time devoted to the ghoulish preacher ranting about the Bible and gay people getting what they deserve. I wanted to see more of the people that came to the small town gay bar not those who opposed it. In addition the young man who was murdered isn't even from this town. The whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration and it's very suspect. ,negative
 This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early high school age kids. Maybe to them it's funny they may possibly even see something scary in it. To me the acting is poor and plot is poor there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer. I saw this film as weak and boring. At times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized. The creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they don't seem to have any substance other than the look. At times I wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again. This movie just wasn't good for me. ,negative
 Gordon Scott with his well coiffed hair hourglass figure and weird pidgin English has to be the worst of all the Tarzans. As for the other actors in this mess they're on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class. I've seen Used Car Dealers in TV commercials who can act better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the dull Eve Brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize these were made for kids but Wow! The plot line seemed OK but the director should have required more from his actors. I realize even the Weissmuller films have a few flaws but this one seemed so low budget . ,negative
 Of all of the post-1985 Perry Mason movies I have seen this one is my least favorite. I confess I have never liked Diana Muldaur as an actress. She only seems to know how to play one type of character - a hard-bitten career woman with some undefined chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way sympathize with. This one is no exception - it runs true to form. The only thing that saves this movie in my opinion is an earnest performance by Scott Baio as the prosecutor - I actually found myself rooting for him to win and the movie is worth seeing for him alone. ,negative
 The narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired.. Ghengis khan historically speaking had a very interesting/epic life but the film failed to capture that- instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story I think I've seen disguised in a slew of other films. I never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead- yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan- pillaging killing and double crossing his way to the top. The one redeeming quality was the photography- the landscapes certainly helped the bleak atmosphere of the film unfortunately combined with the bleakness of the story- I left unmoved and disappointed.. ,negative
 I remember seeing this years ago It had a reasonably promising start with an interesting premise but then it degenerated into nonsense quite quickly. Uninteresting characters failed attempts to add drama and tension and a bit of simplistic philosophy thrown in too all culminating in a terrible ending. Simply it's trash. Before I saw this TV film I didn't think I would ever have any film that I thought was the worst I had seen but after I finished watching this I knew that from then on if anyone asked me what the worst film I had ever seen was I could say without hesitation - The Second Coming . Avoid. ,negative
 One of the most notorious of the banned Video Nasties of the 1980s is also one of the most excessively over-hyped. Make Them Die Slowly is about what you'd expect from an Umberto Lenzi-directed jungle potboilerinventive (yet poorly rendered) native torture techniques some ridiculous social commentary (yes even sillier than Cannibal Holocaust ) and lots of guts being chewed. The film's exploitative violence though is often only shown in brief close-up and never dwelt on for very long which diminishes its effect (interpret that how you may). The dialog is Lenzi's usual silliness as our male heroes show their affection for females by calling them tw@t and the like. The cast of familiar faces (including Lorraine De Selle Giovanni Lombardo Radice Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) does their best in the face of the escalating idiocy (including a completely ludicrous castration preservation ) but cannot save this overworked lousy effort. ,negative
 If it wasn't for the terrific music I would not hesitate to give this cinematic underachievement 2/10. But the music actually makes me like certain passages and so I give it 5/10. ,negative
 Acting 10 Script 1. Hurlyburly is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. While people may get away with this on stage on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. We're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that while brilliantly written adds up to nothing. Even worse every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. The only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif Anna Paquin use the word ain't. Never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme the camera work is plain sloppy and (for LA residents) the attention to geography is laughable. (Hint: the view out Sean Penn's front window is about eight miles away from the view out his back window and you can't drive south through Hollywood and wind up in Glendale pretending to be Burbank.) Okay suspension of disbelief and all that -- and normally I wouldn't pay attention to little things like that because they are just vagaries of production. But the fact that they did stick out so much despite the thespian pyrotechnics on screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise -- the script. In short skip this one even on video. Rabe picked the wrong quote from the Scottish Play for his title; Hurlyburly would have been better named A tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing. A bit long for the marquee perhaps -- but at least it would be honest advertising. ,negative
 Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art Russian sub with a nurse. This is to answer a call for help set off by a dying member of the original crew. The sub has been overtaken by terrorists who are bent on destruction. So we see the duo try and gain control back. And this happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces is about to unleashing everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie. A couple of unexplained scenes towards the end. Watch it when you have the time. Nothing to miss out even if you let the show run while you go get yourself a cup of coffee: slow moving. ,negative
 One commenter said if you like Austin Powers you will like this movie. I liked Autin Powers and was disappointed with this movie. The film works hard maybe too hard for laughs. Maybe it was that all the villains in this movie were shouting as if the shouting in itself is suppose to be funny. I get where they were trying to go with this flick. A cross between Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel but it just doesn't work. Austin Powers if silly but intelligent Zorro the Gay Blade lacks the savvy of Austin Powers The Big Lebowski or Kingpin. I kept waiting for a laugh and while waiting found myself amazed that someone actually got paid for the script. My 15 year daughter also thought the movie was flat. My 17 year old who selected this flick on it's title walked out after 20 minutes. It seems many people on IMDb liked this film but for me it lacked the good timing or jokes of a good comedy. ,negative
 Fred The Hammer Williamson delivers another cheaply made movie. He might have set a new standard for himself. Look for the painfully obvious special effects mortar cannon that is visible in the street during a chase scene. You don't see it just once you see it several times. Look for the out of focus shot in one scene and the camera operator try to fix it as the scene rolls on. Watch this with a group of people and make your own Mystery Science Theater! ,negative
 The beginning of the film is promising. When Jeanne Pollet(Anna Mouglalis) hear the story of the incident that happen on the day she was born that raise the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist André Polonski (Jacques Dutrone) she set to find out whether it's true or not and giving the fact the she plays also the piano that's not such a remote idea. Jeanne meet André and his wife Mika Muller(Isabelle Huppert) and their son and on the way uncover the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much in her own. O.K. we have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here.The character of Mika Muller is left with out us understanding her motives to her action and she is not interesting enough to care for her. The piano scenes look fake and the whole piano sub-plot doesn't add anything to the character's insight but serve as to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place. In short a very disappointing outing from Chabrol who can do better than this ,negative
 You know the story of Sweeney Todd now most likely thanks to Tim Burton's recent movie. You probably don't know it though from this take on the old tale from Andy Milligan-that notorious sleaze merchant that gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels a run for their money. It had to happen eventually. In my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60's to the 80's I'm finally reviewing an Andy Milligan movie. You see from 1964 to 1990 Andy gave us many an exploitation and horror movie-none of which was any good and barely watchable. The Bloodthirsty Butchers is no exception. There is dialog and well there is talk and that's one of the things you will find here-lots and lots of talk. The movie reaches almost Manos The Hands of Fate levels at times as you wait tirelessly for something to happen. While I love cheap looking gore effects the violence is too few and far between and in spite of it's reputation the breast scene isn't that shocking. I love cheap and sleazy exploitation as much as the next trash cinema devotee but Bloodthirsty Butchers is the kind of bad that MST3K would tear apart mercilessly. Sadly Milligan would die of AIDS in 1991 and if there is any movie of his I'd say I sort of like it would be the delirious The Ghastly Ones. This is no Ghastly Ones though-it's just bad. ,negative
 This movie had a very unique effect on me: it stalled my realization that this movie REALLY sucks! It is disguised as a thinker's film in the likes of Memento and other jewels like that but at the end and even after a few minutes you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p. Probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks. The whole idea is  I don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak one btw) with stupid riddles the kind you learn on elementary school recess you suddenly come to the one truth about everything then you have to kill someone and confess. !!! What? How what why WHY? Is just like saying that to make a cake just throw a bunch of ingredients and add water forgot about cooking it? I guess these guys forgot to not explain but present the mechanism of WHY was this happening? You have to do that when you present a story which normal everyday acts (lie solving riddle rhymes) start to have an abnormal effect on people. Acting was horrible with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera and the guy from Highlanders the series acting up like the though heavy metal record store (yeah they're all real though s-o-b's). The menacing atmosphere with the oh-so-clever riddles (enter the 60's series of Batman and Robin with guest appearance of The Riddle) and the crazies who claim to have the knowledge behind that smirk on their faces just horrible HORRIBLE. I'm usually very partial about low budget movies and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve in lieu of their constrictions you know but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it. ,negative
 I was only cautiously enthusiast when renting All the boys love Mandy Lane as I instantly remembered hearing & reading a wide variety of opinions  both positive and negative  in the short period of time between its brief cinematic release and the distribution towards videostore shelves. Supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years with non-stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change. Okay the basic concept may perhaps sound reasonably innovative but inevitably the screenplay quickly reverts to the same old and irritating slasher clichés and once passed that point even the nifty stylistic trademarks can't save the film from dreadful mediocrity. The opening sequences are indeed terrific and literally bath in a moodily melancholic ambiance which actually makes it all the more painful to witness the film sink towards the ordinary level of rudimentary slasher flick. After the sublime intro showcasing a drunk macho kid miscalculate his jump off a rooftop in order to impress the titular beauty All the Boys Love Mandy Lane turns out to be just another textbook and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic kids getting stoned and horny on a secluded ranch before getting killed off by a not-so-unidentified maniac. The film's entire pretentious set-up collapses faster than a ramshackle house of cards: we never get a proper explanation why Mandy herself behaves so frigid and haughty towards all her admirers (because she grew up an orphan perhaps? Oh boo-hoo) the boys soon enough illustrate they'd settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the divine Mandy and the final twist  albeit undeniably offbeat  is just plain senseless. The middle section of is rather boring and doesn't even offer any genuinely horrific excitement (shotgun killings? Please!) or authentic rancid sleaze. My generous rating 4 out of 10 entirely goes to the grainy and unsettling 70's filming style (with faded colors bizarre but beautiful photographic images) and the surprisingly marvelous soundtrack. Director Jonathan Levine opted for the classic Bobby Vinton song Sealed with a Kiss to play during the trailer and end-credits whereas I initially was convinced the film would inevitably feature Barry Manilow's cheesy love-song Mandy . ,negative
 It must be remembered that the Gammera movies like many of the first-series Gozilla films WERE in fact aimed squarely at kids. Little Kenny and his cohorts are living out the daydreams of the kids in the audience: they get to run around and play with top-secret stuff while the adults stand by and allow it; they get to cavort with monsters and even when the bad guys enter they are never in any real danger. Perhaps the first Gammera film is an aberration because the child DOES get punished and IS put into danger but the rest of the series is pure wish fulfillment. As one critic said these aren't failed adult movies but successful kid's movies. ,negative
 Being a huge horror movie fan one of the most difficult things to be considering the lack of abundance of good movies in the genre and having seen hundreds of them in my lifetime I have to say that Dracula 3000 is by far the most uninspired lame and poorly done piece of trash I have had the misfortune to see. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! It's so bad it's not even laughable. The special effects (did I say special ?) were probably achieved spending a couple of grand the acting is terrible and the script should have ended up in the trash bin after the first read by the studio that decided to take on this miserable project. The whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse. Also for you guys out there who like nudity in your movies don't be fooled by the R rating. If you're thinking you get a chance to see Erika Eleniak even half-naked you're wrong. She is fully clothed throughout the entire movie. And the cover art is completely misleading! There is no scene in any part of the movie that even marginally resembles the awesome cover art they put on the box to draw unsuspecting horror fans. Too bad the rating is only 1 to 10. I would give this movie a -10. Be warned. Don't waste your money or your time on this one. ,negative
 Great book poorly done movie. Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. Flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the After School Special category. No doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong The very talented Gretchen Mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. Feels like everyone just phoned it in. Even the makeup (Mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude. Don't waste your time on this clunker.... go read the book. ,negative
 Okul The School is a result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. Having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas. Of course it doesn't mean that they are all grand. I think Okul is one of them. It is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not. It is not successful on being scary either. So what is it? Actors are so average especially Deniz Akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role. I am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder. Maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa. But directors have missed the target this time. ** out of ***** ,negative
 This final installment of the Airport franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn't a slapstick comedy like Airplane . George Kennedy shooting a flare gun out an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles was comical. What would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at mach two speed? You'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm. The passengers were unintentionally hilarious as was the interior of the plane. The sophisticated French woman coming on to slobby George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy coming on to Ernest Borgnine. Ain't gonna happen. Susan Blakely a talented and unappreciated actress did not get any points on her resume for this one. Neither did Robert Wagner. This movie was so lousy it seemed surreal. ,negative
 Death Machines takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts killing machines sent out to eliminate a crime boss' opponents) and turns it into an unwatchable mess. I have rarely seen such a breath taking combination of tiny budget bad acting and incoherent script released as a so-called movie . It's easily the worst martial-arts/action oriented movie I've seen in years eclipsing even Ninja Holocaust (which at least had some good energetic fight scenes). The actual star of the movie is the white Death Machine (it's basically his vehicle) so he is featured prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts. He's in good shape and he's not bad looking but as an actor he's barely there - think Chuck Norris in The Octagon only without any energy or emotion.This is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director...but you have to be Arnold to pull this kind of thing off and this guy is no Arnold. The movie (and the director) can't seem to find the time (or the budget) to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that it originally posed like: Who was the shadowy figure giving the marbled-mouthed Asian lady her orders? How did the gang war end? Why did the mush-mouthed Asian lady decide to have her zombie assassins killed? And what the heck happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broom stick? It does however find the time to film a completely extraneous bar fight in which a sailor (well he looked like Popeye) destroys a bar because the juke box didn't work. It's only related to the rest of the film because in the process he also K.O.'s the movie's hero a bartender/karate student who was a victim of the Death Machines first major assignment (he got his hand chopped off while they were killing his teacher). It follows this up with one of the most un-called for love scenes between the hero and his girlfriend I have ever watched. The segue makes no sense - at the end of the bar-fight she's grimacing over his splayed limp body and the next thing they are in a tasteful shadow montage of sex and love that looks like it came from a Hallmark card. BTW we never see the sailor again. And wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain - it plays as if the director and screenwriter never actually saw a movie scene placed inside a police station but had heard of them second hand and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked. The movie is a textbook case of poor casting and community theater-level actors floundering without decent direction. The three Death Machines come across as clods; the hero knows his lines but can't carry the movie given that his character is an ineffective wimp; his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; and all the other minor parts are barely watchable. All this makes for a fairly poor movie- but the dragon lady does more to drag the movie into subterranean stinker territory than anyone or anything else. She looks ridiculous; her tiny inexpressive face is overpowered by her ton-o-hair skyscraper wig she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe and she talks with a terrible mush-mouth delivery that screams needed time with a dialog coach . Poor lady - she was obviously way out of her element and as far as I know never appeared in a film again. Add to this a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never shuts up and never plays anything appropriate or interesting; crappy film stock and lighting; fight choreography that is strictly from hunger; and a general all around dreariness and lack of energy in the blocking and the stage business...and you have one lame movie. I got this as part of a 50 movie DVD compilation so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it. It wasn't worth it. Feh! ,negative
 This was like watching the trailer of a up and coming movie except that there was no movie coming up. The film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished as to be almost laughable. The subject of this film is over a very short time frame and frankly nothing much actually happens in the 90 odd minutes of screen time. I was hoping for the definitive Australian film about our soldiers in WWII and how they fought against incredible odds in awful conditions.This is most certainly not it. Having said that the acting was great and locations authentic. This could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time instead it isn't even mediocre and I cannot recommend it at all. ,negative
 Watched the director's cut last night...glad it was free rental even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at film noir . The anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me not clever seeming more like budget constraints than anything else. The non-traditional casting I also found distracting. If I have to stop following the story to wonder what the heck is the black chick/drag queen doing there? then the storyteller has failed me. Again not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating and very film school final project-ish. And for pete's sake if you are going to shoot in black and white at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color. There was no use of nuance in the lighting no shades of gray no depth no texture...just black and just white...boring! ,negative
 If I was still 5 I might find it scary. It is (I guess) a low budget film. The acting is not good but could be worse - the filming and special effect is awful. The story line is thin and not worth to dwell on. Too much time is used on boring shouting scenes. The chases or fight with aliens remind me of kids fighting with scary masks on. Some gore with blood and body parts - would scare a 5 year old kid I guess. Apparently scare the crap out of some of the persons in the film. It is far from reaching anything like the film Tremors. This turns out to be an incident and we see alien ships nearby earth. It make you wonder if any will make a sequel... ,negative
 This movie has got to be about one of the worst i have ever seen. The humor was crude hardly funny and been heard a million times before. The start was noting special and it got worse and worse as it went on. I got about halfway through and couldn't stand to watch any more of it. Luckily I was only watching it on TV so it didn't cost anything but I seriously recommend you do not waste you time or your money. Nothing in the movie was new. The characters were not at all developed. I actually think it would have been better as a little kids movie in that it was full of stupid unrealistic funny events occurring ... thats like what happens in home alone or something. Not to imply home alone was in any way as terrible as this. ,negative
 As several posters have hinted this is a sorry Star Wars ripoff. Now if you're going to rip off Star Wars at least do it right; Battlestar Galactica did and there were a few other space operas that didn't do a bad job of it but this is definitely not one of them. David Mendenhall the juvenile lead actually isn't too bad though he goes overboard on the cute factor every so often. Vince Edwards hasn't improved much as an actor since his Ben Casey days; if anything he's even more wooden than he was ten. The other performances are nothing to write home about either. Even worse are the special effects; the best you can say about them is that they're lousy. It's glaringly obvious that the aliens are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little foam or latex slopped on them and the battle scenes between Edwards' raiders and the aliens are poorly staged and badly shot. A very weak effort from Roger Corman. Skip it. ,negative
 The Devil's Men represents what turned out to be one of the last gasps of the occult obsessed horror scene of the 70's shortly before Halloween came along tore up the rule book set fire to it and kicked it screaming through a plate glass window. To cut a long story short a couple of enterprising Greek film makers fancy their chances of nailing together a new film franchise featuring the unlikely double act of womanising wise talking American investigator Milo and stuffy but kind hearted priest Father Roche. An exiled nobleman is mixed up in some satanic jiggery pokery - offering up tourists as sacrifices to an extremely unfrightening effigy of the minotaur and only Milo and Roche can stop him! Or something like that. The reality is however horribly dull frustrating and loaded with wasted opportunities. I strongly suspect that the fledgling film makers blew most of the budget on getting Donald Plesance Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) onboard and hoped that would be enough to sway audiences in the English speaking world. It isn't. The Devil's Men looks beautiful with assured camera-work and fantastic locations. Eno's score though basically just a one chord drone that he probably cranked out in an afternoon is suitably atmospheric and the movie is laden with cracking 70's crumpet including that Austrailian sort from Fawlty Towers and uber hottie Jane Lyle of Island of Death infamy. But there the positives end. Cushing sleepwalks through it looking like he has a corn cob up his bum and Pleasance fusses about trying his best but never quite getting things right. To make matters worse the character of Milo is appallingly flimsy and unlikeable. Okay so it doesn't look that good. But from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is an insinuation that the local villagers are possessed but to be fair to them they never really do anything very much other than shuffle about looking glassy eyed. Perhaps they were just tired? Just when you are sure things will come to some kind of a head Milo and Roche interrupt the Baron's satanic party with laughable ease sending him on to meet his maker. The statue of the minotaur falls silent and hey presto! Satan is defeated. Yeah right. The inane optimism that The Devil's Men might be the first of a series of films is hammered home by Father Roche's final line mere seconds before the ridiculously rushed ending. Who knows Milo? Perhaps one day I may call upon you again to help defeat the Antichrist. I'm sure you'll be putting that call in any day now Donald. ,negative
 End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen. Muddling direction meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes rapid-fire MTV-style editing and poor acting all the way. That's not to say End of Days isn't watchable. The movie kept me interested because I found Ah-nuld's latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic. Without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker which is why End of Days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the U.S. I won't go into the details explaining why End of Days violates the law of movie logic but here are several problems with this movie: (SPOILER) After the Devil walks out the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it. No snapping finger no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire nothing. How could this happen? Arnold and his annoying sidekick Kevin Pollack somehow magically comes up with the name Christine York after examining the phrase Christ in New York carved on a victim's body runs the database on the computer and viola Christine York the only person with the exact name in all of New York City! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. How did the characters who have come in contact with Arnold's character turn against him later in the movie? I laughed out loud when I recognized the good-stepmother-turned-evil-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagine. All the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle? The Devil took a man's body comprising of flesh and blood yet he's invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body. Logically this is impossible. As the Devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment Arnold's character runs into the solid Christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and *falls on it* physically. The Devil is capable of punching the person's brains out and twisting a victim's head 180 degree yet he could not kill Arnold's character as he always intends to. How the Devil's object of desire's parents died and why evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all. In the sequence that's a rip-off of Speed Arnold and the Devil's object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed. This is beyond my comprehension since the force would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impact. Arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the Devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall yet the Devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience's sake. At the beginning of the movie after the Devil took over a man's body all of a sudden Arnold is his bodyguard??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing? Arnold's recital of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME! are the perfect fodder for MST3K just as Eraser did with the classic line You're the luggage! . The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ludicrous. So are the pseudo-religious babble about the Christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the Devil's object of desire. (END SPOILERS) It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. The director's indulgence of excess is a factor here. He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money. Hence End of Days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness -- Arnold's worst since Hercules in New York. ,negative
 All I have to say is one word...SUCKS!!!!. The only reason I gave this a 2 is because Josh Hartnett was in it and he's cool. Should have beat that Klein guys ass...stupid dumb and brainless. By the end of this movie you can't stand Klein and you really don't care what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing about it. ,negative
 What can I say about this movie it really is one of the worst gay themed movies ever to come out of the UK. I can only imagine the likes of Diana Quick and Georgina Hale needed the money. What story there is is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly. It's supposed to be based on real life events. Well all I can say to that one is that it's an insult to the real life characters. The DVD is out at the moment in the UK. It's available in either the split screen format which must make it even worse that the full screen version I watch. Gay cinema can be so much better than this and we deserve more. ,negative
 This is one of the worst films i've ever seen don't watch it even if your life depends on it. This Laurel and Hardy film is when they inherit an island become shipwrecked and are set to be hung. An incredibly boring film that is no where near funny. This was the last Laurel and Hardy film and what a very low note to end such a superb career. The 40's films weren't great this film was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy remember them in their prime the 1930's. The short talking films are better than the feature length films my favourite is Me and My Pal . Another reason this film is awful is because it's dubbed. The actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later. Absoulutley crap but let's end on a high note Laurel and Hardy have been in my opinion the best double act ever. ,negative
 I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. In fact it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. I actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how Canadian Indian second generations feel about sex. At any rate did you know the first hotel/drunk idea was copied from a Korean movie Yopgijogin gunyo made in 2001 or thereabouts? That Korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman difference in experience and thinking. I mean most of the Neal N Nikki hotel/drunk segment was emulated take by take. Can't Bollywood movie makers try to make originals only please? Seriously I never enjoyed a Hindi flick that is a copycat. The ones I enjoy have always spoken Indian feelings through Indian cultural means. ,negative
 I don't know if I should be amused or insulted by drivel like this put out by Lifetime: Television For Women Should be renamed Lifetime: Television For Shut In Drama Queens because I've yet to see a movie that wasn't a tear jerking pot boiler. This film was no exception. You know a film's going to be bad when the biggest headliner is Tori Spelling completely a creation of bad plastic surgery and spoiled privilege minus any real talent. Everyone else matched her in unbelievably bad acting and the storyline was beyond dumb as if anyone could believe any of it. If I hadn't have been helpless on the sofa pinned down watching with the same fascination you view a gory car wreck I would have changed the channel. ,negative
 I was pulled into this movie early on much to my surprise because I hadn't intended to watch it at all. Now I wish I hadn't. The suspense starts out well with the hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess or be found out or (doable now though a no-no in the old days of movie-making) get away with it. The plot's been done before--what plot hasn't--but the tensions inherent in it with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair make for an absorbing first half. Then the film abandons the hit-and-run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited all-suffering loves. The two tracks of plot--hit-and-run and unreasoning love--just don't have enough to do with each other and that they involve the same characters doesn't bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. At the end of the film in the midst of the movie's second funeral I found myself thinking Now what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run? The filmmakers may think the answer obvious but I think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily. ,negative
 Without actually giving away my age I saw this for the first time over 20 years ago when it first came out on video (maybe it was a beta tape??) and I was old enough to drink (barely) and perhaps I had had a few because I remember thinking how great this movie was! I have since seen it sober and have to admit it is a pretty bad film. As mentioned in other posts the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the poor acting just makes it worse. It's a poor attempt to fantasize that teenagers too can be Mavericks (although I am surprised to find out it actually was to be released the same time (aprox) as Top Gun and not actually meant to be a poor imitation.) But for all it's worth - I do find myself watching it if it's on and I have the time. It's one of those movies you watch because it's just so ridiculous and tries so desperately to take itself seriously. Like that other great' film - Moment by Moment with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin....don't get me started on that one! ,negative
 This movie was terrible. The plot was terrible and unbelievable. I cannot recommend this movie. Where did this movie come from? This movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including: Gary Sinise Kathy Bates Joey Lauren Adams and Jennifer Tilly. ,negative
 The Wizard of Menlo Park was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007: even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants he gave birth to the electric light the phonograph the motion picture camera the electric car battery the electric power grid (possibly his most important but least recalled invention) the pre-fabricated house and innovations to the telephone and telegraph as well as the ticker-tape machine and an early voting machine. The total number of patents is over 1 000 - far more than any other American Inventor. But Edison was a ruthless business competitor. He frequently had vast legal fights over the precedence of his inventions over rivals. The best example is the telephone where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against Alexander Graham Bell. Actually Edison's invention here was not the central idea that Bell and Gray had come up with independently of each other in 1876 but an improvement on the sound quality of the phone receiver and transmitter that Bell did not develop. Still it was part of the huge 1888 Supreme Court decision that was the longest U.S. Supreme Court decision (a single volume of their reports!) written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite - which by the way killed the poor Chief Justice from overwork within weeks of completing it. In 1886 Edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of electric power grids for large cities. This was George Westinghouse inventor of the railroad air break. Westinghouse's firm had gotten the assistance of a new inventor and former Edison assistant Nicola Tesla. Tesla developed alternating current which was a rival system to Edison's direct current . Edison's system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity. Tesla's system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another - actually it was a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to break this rival by a publicity campaign. It started with electric power lines. Edison early on had his lines put underground so that they would not be endangered by weather conditions. But Westinghouse was forced to have his lines out in the open - like telephone lines. When there were several accidental deaths by repair linemen on Westinghouse's lines (in particular one incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers in Manhattan's business district) Edison started insisting that A.C. current was far more dangerous that D.C. One result of all this was Edison helping some subsidiary inventors with getting Westinghouse A.C. generators and dynamos for an electric chair. Edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair but he helped several lesser figures along the way - for the complete story read Mark Essig's EDISON & THE ELECTRIC CHAIR (New York: WALKER & COMPANY 2003). Edison experiment himself with cats and dogs (experiments he was glad to show the public). In the long run despite assisting in the invention of a new method of execution Edison failed to dislodge the public support of Alternating Current. But he never stopped trying. In 1903 he had an opportunity to combine his campaign against Westinghouse and A.C. with his invention of the motion picture camera. He assisted in putting down a well known public elephant ( Topsy ) who had killed several men. He did so by electrocuting the poor beast with A.C. But the entire killing is on film - and one can view it to this day. It is a pitiful looking film - whatever poor Topsy had done it was a poor beast - not a Machiavellian murderer. The moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant we are aware it will soon be over but the sudden collapse of Topsy is still an unpleasant sight to view. The film leaves a bad flavor in the mouths of modern movie audiences. Yet sad to say it probably made a profit for Edison - his description of the film in his catalog of films shows real pride in his accomplishment here. In 1903 it may have been exciting entertainment for many Americans watching it. One is glad that more people are appalled by it today - sometimes one can sense the human race has improved a little bit. ,negative
 What can I say? This was one awful movie to watch. I am normally not very critical of gay cinema in general due to the fact that most are usually low-budget but this really pushed me up the wall. I mean is this was has happened to gay cinema? Haven't gay producers and directors learned anything from Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee's films?. Just having to sit through the entire movie was like being in a dentist's chair and having my wisdom teeth extracted. I kept on praying for moments where I would feel any sort of connection with any of the characters but that never happened. Most of the characters performances were just not very convincing. It was like watching one of those badly produced made-for-TV movie specials on a local access TV stations. I cannot tell u how greatly disappointed It was seeing this film after being a big fan of Tori Spellings other works and the directors last work on Latter day saints. It was definitely not worth the wait. Definitely a few hours of my life I will never get back and will certainly not be purchasing it on DVD. ,negative
 This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle to be specific) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same you'd see from a Cinemax softcore porn as is the photography sets lighting and video it was shot on. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty trite. Want an example? A blind girl listening to a language tape teaching the Italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never see. This movie had a few things going for it however: the monster is actually pretty cool pretty scary-looking. And there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from Raffaella Offidani herself a star of Italian erotic films. The gore however leaves much to be desired as does the acting even from the experienced Jeffrey Combs. Other than this I've only seen two other Stuart Gordon films: Re-Animator and From Beyond both of which were outstanding. But I won't let this little footnote in his career keep me from watching many more of his movies. ,negative
 A poorly-paced sf/horror venture that takes itself much too seriously memorable only for (a) the beautiful Mathilda May wandering around naked through the chaos and (b) terrible miscasting. It has a few mildly gruesome effects and startling moments and some unintentionally funny scenes but is mostly a waste of time. ,negative
 I did not quite get Barnens O  it is one of the weirdest ones I have watched. The soundtrack was quite unusual as well  written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was. I have to admit that I was almost going to change it and watch another one instead at times the movie seemed plain dumb to me or boring  or confusing. There are quite a few sexual references in that movie  trough they too are kind of messed up . Probably the only phrase that I will remember out of it is going to be When you are alone you can control things  and I will show them - or something like that .The boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up  the last summer as a child he thought once  and he sure lived it to the max. So if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie  but you won't miss much if you don't. ,negative
 ******Spoilers within******* What a dull predictable non-scary snore-fest. The movie had no character development: I felt no empathy towards any of the characters (except may be the small boy) and did not care what happened to any of them. The movie had so many clichéd bits or elements stolen from other horror movies. The movie was so predictable. Many times I would be saying to myself Let me guess {fill in guess} happens next? Yup I was right. Even in the opening scene I predicted that the attack on the family was by some man probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). Sure enough that is what happened (of course you have to wait 79 minutes to find out for sure). And of course another evil man scenario. Why was he evil and killing his family? Because he's a man duh! As someone else stated this movie may be scary for someone under 13 years of age or for a movie from the 1970's but it is FAR from being a 'scary' movie by todays standards. AND like so many other crap horror movies a lot of the scares were fakes . Scary music Scary music Scary music and.....A crow suddenly flies at the window! Wow scary! How did the old bank guy manage a few times to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him? I thought for sure that the old man was a ghost. Nope just a crappy movie. I rated this movie a 2 out of 10 because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole thing. ,negative
 How awful is it? Let me count the ways: 1) It is a bait-and-switch movie that starts out being about a UFO investigation then turns into a high-pressure sales job for Christianity. C'mon! If the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message why disguise it? It annoys non-believers and pushes fence-sitters in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them I'd run like Hell in the opposite direction. They're scary! 3) The acting is terrible. They all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace. 4) The cinematography is home-movie bad. Wait actually its not even that good. 5) Script bad bad bad. All dialogue no action. Like a tennis match they bounce back and forth between the talking head close ups. 6) Direction... what direction? Oh there must have been a director there somewhere. I challenge you to figure out where. Believe it or not I have some positive comments about this movie. The editing seemed professional but couldn't make a difference. A good edit of bad material is still a bad movie. The opening theme music was actually very good! Very scary and UFO-ish. Too bad the movie wasn't about UFOs. If you can't tell already here's the bottom line. I wasted my money seeing this movie and it made me angry. If they had not disguised what this movie was really about I could say it was my fault. ,negative
 Sideshow is a good example of a basically interesting idea gone very very wrong. As far as horror movies go and especially with the influx of teen movies at the moment a film based around a bunch of teens attending a mysterious freak show is something you could have a lot of fun with. However the writer decided to make a very straight very boring very plain tale about five teens who become part of the show when enraged midget Abbot Graves transforms them into freaks using some pathetic machine that mutates them into beasts. The five teens are picked off one by one until the last guy is left his 'punishment' being that he is unable to join his friends and thus 'be alone'. What a load of rubbish! The 'actors' are really poor this film has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!) no gore (and it could have been so gory!) no action and no horror (and it could have had so much of both!) The director has failed in his duty to even try to make this a little interesting to watch. His experience in soft-core has obviously disabled any creativity he may ever have had as all the shots are the same with very few edits and little movement. The quality overall is poor. I'm not usually swayed by nudity in movies but believe me the only high point in this film was a pair of breasts. ,negative
 I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory non stop action great movie.. These people were obviously watching a different movie. Killpoint honestly sucked from the word go!! I kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no avail. Some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but I can't find either of those adjectives actually showing up in this I mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all it's not even funny!! I guess the best way to sum this up is it probably should've been rated PG by 1984 standards and now in the year 2010 there is no doubt this would be PG!! Bad BAD not in the fun cheesy B variety movie!! ,negative
 A trio sit at a restaurant table and stare wordlessly into space. Later they lean on a rail and stare across the Channel at England. A man works a hoe repetitively in his garden only his head and upper torso visible on the screen. A man and a woman watch another man peeing against a stone wall. Each of these silent shots lasts for roughly one full minute. Absolutely no information is imparted that could not be given to us in about one quarter of the time. The editor must have been half asleep. I know I was. The movie open with a startling shot of the raw vagina of an obviously dead body. One's gorge rises. But then the policeman (Schotte) exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and begins to tag along after them and the case is forgotten for the next half hour while Schotte and his friends trade unfunny insults with each other and with strangers. Eventually the thread of the case is picked up again but proceeds slowly almost aimlessly following the stylistic pattern already established. Sometimes in movies like this the location shooting provides a kind of atmosphere that compensates for the dullness of the story but not here. The houses of the French village are attached to one another in long rows. The house fronts abut the pavement directly with no steps. The fronts show virtually no decoration and are pretty much indistinguishable. The flat farmlands are featureless. What might have been one of the more interesting episodes -- a visit to a stone fort on the coast -- bores the trio until they begin behaving like snots and are asked to leave. The acting is minimal. Nobody seems particularly anxious to say anything. No jokes are made. Nothing amusing happens. The policeman has a face almost as interesting as Randy Quaid's. The babe a tall hefty blonde looks like the kind of shot putter on steroids that the East Germans used to field at the Olympic Games. I sat through more than an hour of it before giving it up. Maybe I'll take a crack at it some other time. Unless I've missed something or unless it turns into some deranged Monty Python routine towards the end I don't think you'll get much out of renting it. ,negative
 Anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film. It's interesting they titled it The Hole ! The production values are good for a short film. The hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on. I speculate if this was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat. Many hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience regardless of story and content. My honest opinion 3 out of 10 for this effort. Maybe Ishimoto's next film will deliver. ,negative
 First of all let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I'd been sold a bill of goods. Mind you it's not the movie's fault that IMDb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although I don't know how that's entered...maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). Being a fan of the horror/comedy genre I checked it out based on that and I'm so so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all to touch back on my beginning there's no comedy in this movie. It tries once or twice but never gets more than a chuckle at best. My reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny. Also there's no horror here. Not a second of tension can be found. You think I'm exaggerating...I am not. No tension very little blood and not much violence on screen (sorry but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul). Hell...there's even zero nudity. Call me a purist or juvenile...I prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot/premise. And that tired as all hell reality TV show gone wrong thing ? It's been done before and a lot better. Like Wrong Turn 2 or...ummm....whatever that movie was called with Edward Furlong. That's how bad this movie is. I don't even remember the name of that movie but it was better than this. I also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because reality TV is taking over . Did someone from the past post that with a time machine? Are you freaking kidding me? This thing is trash...and not in a fun way. ,negative
 If you like really shocking movies this is for you. The acting is the worst I've ever seen and the story line goes no-where. If you come across this film in your video shop don't even consider borrowing it. The chick on the front cover isn't even the one in the movie.I gave this movie 1/10 only because I couldn't vote 0. Avoid it at all costs. ,negative
 this movie is about people living at a trailerpark. later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are out-of-work comedians mainly old males. well more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f***ing. but never there is any action just those people talking. in the beginning I thought it's some cool perverted redneck-stuff but after a while it got boring. I mean how many versions can you think of saying f***ing d**k & c**t? for sure this can be funny - for half an hour maybe not 80 minutes. but it was funny to watch those people trying to act. I'm pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing. but it does not disturb the movie it's cool like this. because those individuals seem so poor f***ed-up crestfallen a***oles that the style totally fits. their wooden helpless reading of the texts makes quite good atmosphere I fell in love with the characters a little. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** later in the movie the f***ers do some comedy-shows (rhymes about f***ing) with just themselves as audience and imagined applause. then one gets an eviction-advice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their roofs - armed with some weapons. then they got shoot. fin. sounds like action but it's not. just some trashy home-camera takes. ***SPOILER END*** but the movie is totally consequent in it's style and I'm pretty sure it's just what the movie-maker wanted to have. it's the portrait of those f**k-ups in an groggy home-camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch. but the texts about - you know what - the whole time get boring after a while. pretty young director who also seems an interesting person as he played some teenager-stuff in popular movies/TV-series but now got in more horror-movies which is more his cup of tea I guess. and this his first direction-effort will be distributed by troma now. don't know anything about a release I got this one as an advance screener from this years cannes which says for bootlegging purposes only . ,negative
 As I sat watching this episode I kept glancing at the clock waiting for something to happen. As the hour wound down I thought they were really going to give us a big pop at the end and then - nothing. The whole family is huddled around the Christmas tree like something from the Hallmark Channel then fade to black. Perhaps one of the poorest season finales I've ever seen. Nothing at all to drum up any excitement for next season. The only thing thrown out as any sort of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered up by Agent Harris while pawing a sub sandwich that the guys in New York were looking to get one of the guys in New Jersey. Wow really? I would never expect something like that from mobsters I'm on the edge of my seat. It almost seems like they're trying to get everyone to lose interest. They start more plot lines that end up just disappearing than any show I've ever seen. They tease and hint but rarely deliver any more. What's with the Arabs that hang out at the Bing? They keep throwing them in front of us and magically nothing happens. Paulie knee caps some kid after Tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and poof gone in the wind. And how many more meandering drug montages with Christopher are we going to have to endure? Please have him get arrested or overdose or something interesting. This was one of the few shows that I used to looked forward to watching but now forgetta-bout it. ,negative

 First off I refuse to even consider this piece of work a Music video... I consider it a short film that uses excerpts of the song Thriller in its soundtrack. To me a music video must be no longer than the song itself and the song must play the entire length of the video. Calling this a music video is like calling The Great Gatsby a poem. On top of this... let's face it... thriller is a boring 14 minutes including the extremely dated werewolf transformation the mindless Vincent Price poem (just because VP recites it doesn't mean it's not lame) and the least threatening zombies I have ever seen. Sure this was certainly a cultural phenomenon but don't forget this also happened at the same time the A-Team was the #1 show on TV so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one... One last point on this film's impact on the media on music videos... what exactly did this add to the equation that Billie Jean and Beat It didn't already add? From what I can tell it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog or a superfluous dance scene... so you could say that all this video really did was give Puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos... Not quite my definition of great ,negative
 I think this movie can be called the movie of misdirected rage. The characters of Joe and Bob were relics of the WWII generation who didn't quite understand their kids opposing the war taking drugs and listening to rock and roll. But I think their real rage was at the fact that America was beginning her long decline from the heights the war left her at. Joe himself is a low-rent Archie Bunker ranting at all the things that have made him angry living his life of quiet desperation until he teams up with Compton a guy who wants to avenge himself on the hippies who ruined his daughter. Honestly most of the movie looks silly the characters are worse than one dimensional they're laughable. Peter Boyle was capable of better stuff. ,negative
 I have vague memories of this movie being funny. Having seen it again either I have changed or I was thinking about a another film altogether. It seems as if we are supposed to be sympathetic to Jackie Mason's character however nothing in the movie actually engenders that emotion. Its notable that he is really the only person accorded tender dialogue with loved ones. No-one else's character is allowed to rise to the status of even vaguely human. I don't even like golf but as the film went on I found myself really rooting for Robart Stack and the club guys really hoping they would repel Mason and Chevy Chase. ,negative
 Summary: Not worth the film As an avid Gone With the Wind fan I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. Luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. While the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as I was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable. However I consider the six hours I spent watching the Scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from. The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. In the novel Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. After coming to an arrangement with Rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah. Eventually she accompanies her cousin Colum a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood to Ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named The O'Hara the head of the family. While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She having been scorned by Rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry Luke the earl of Fenton until Rhett comes along in a clichéd night-on-white-horse - type of a rescue. The Scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice. Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed. I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision. ,negative
 Mixing small town sheriffs high-school students fake rock music and some weirdo who kills for well no reason in particular this film is essentially a re-make of The Giant Gila Monster - except without the gila monster of course. Now anyone who has actually seen Giant Gila Monster knows that it is one of the worst made films of all time frequently so slow it's not even funny. And I can't believe that by 1967 Giant Gila Monster had earned such a reputation that young directors were just dying to get to work on a sequel let alone a remake. So will someone please explain to me why this film was made?! The dance sequence by the way is historically interesting although about three years out of date; but even that's spoiled since it goes on... and on... and... on.... ,negative
 A little while ago I stumbled upon this DVD while browsing Netflix and with such an impressive cast decided to give it a go. Never before have I seen a movie try to be a new version of an existing great movie (Scarface) and failing so spectacularly. The main issue seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. In Scarface Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed bad guy. His spectacular rise and eventual downfall wasn't sad it was a great (and the only logical ending) to someone who lived such a life. Damian Chapa as director writer and lead actor sees Kilo as some sort of hero or at least a complicated guy. However he doesn't want to do the grunt work of creating a realistic sympathetic character. He was raised by a white mother except for the six months of his childhood where his father a gangster himself showed him his life. For reasons never fully explained or even really mentioned he decides he wants to be a drug dealer and actually drives to the bad part of town approaches two dealers and says Hey I'd like to buy some drugs. He drops his father's name and in apparently no time they are not only rich the two guys who are supplying him are acting subserviently to him for reasons again never explained. Chapa wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to prison when a police informant lies about him. However since he's dealt large quantities of drugs before why should one feel sympathy for him going to jail for it this time? The most obvious case of Chapa wanting to be the good guy is in his prison execution of a White Supremacist/rapist played by Gary Busey. In Scarface Tony Montana kills someone in prison because he pretty much has to in order to elevate himself it's done he moves on. But in this case they ham-handedly have to make Busey not only a rapist/pedophile but also a White supremacist. A little overkill don't you think? I won't go into detail in this regard too much more but their desperate message of PLEASE LIKE ME! I'M A COMPLICATED GANGSTER! fails on every level. Try as they might I didn't feel bad conflicted or sympathetic when his buddies are killed (following a shootout) his wife is also killed (shortly after she called him out on being a lousy father and during an attempted escape when he decided it'd be OK to ride right next to a car filled with gunmen while his wife is in the car) and his eventual demise. Suffice it to say his acting can be fairly summed up as lousy his only achievement bringing the term wooden to starry new heights. Busey should be credited for actually putting effort into his ridiculous role. Tiny Lister did well. Stacy Keach is playing his warden from Prison Break role. Robert Wagner is coasting for a paycheck. Faye Dunaway while a touch dramatic still turns in a performance better than this movie deserved. Brad Dourif is in the film for about two minutes and does what he can. And to give the film credit it does one-up Scarface in one way - Jennifer Tilly now holds the title of Most Ridiculous Attempt at a Hispanic Accent. (Sorry Robert Loggia.) In short this movie had an interesting premise but a poor story arc unsympathetic characters and hit-or-miss performances. I'd advise Mr. Chapa to ease up on the forced sympathy next time - really we don't need to like your character we just need to be interested. Better luck next time. ,negative
 Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best but unable to resist vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is a ham-fisted meaningless trudge with a B-movie sci-fi premise. The second achieves some poignancy but only via the outrage-inducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character. The third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to Child's Play. The direction is consistently clueless - all whirling sound and fury a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment; suffocating in an ill-chosen music score and in indifferently flashy acting. This is sheer stupidity masquerading as a guerilla sensibility - as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that link the three sections. ,negative
 So much for JUDGE AND JURY which lives up to its nonsense title. What good is there? The lighting is terribly foggy! Another horror movie you ask? Well that's perfectly explainable. David Keith actually does pretty good at disguising clowns chefs and other shenanigans while being the killer who escaped death row. But overall despite some new twists it's reasonably stupid. Unapix has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently and this one only means so much. We the jury find this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing it's a total waste of our time! ,negative
 Keep away from this one. The worst thing is the appalling story. There seems to be an intent to convey some subtle spiritual/love/friendship message but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance you can't help but cringe. In addition the majority of screen time is a far below standard story of thieves criminals and our hero(es) dealing with some alien time travel artifacts. I know you are asking for trouble when dealing with time but the story is more full of holes than usual. Also you have: cheap sets bad acting and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of the moving picture overpowering cheap abrupt and disjointed. All I can say is Man alive ! This film is bad !  ,negative
 Scanning through the comments there doesn't appear to be a lot of love for this movie and it's not very hard to see why it's rubbish. Now I will start by saying that the finished product was hurt in any number of ways by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr Loomis) in post production. This required a re-jigging of the film's conclusion with Loomis buying the farm and took away what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with Micheal swapping places with mysterious Man in black and I do not mean Johnny Cash. Now to the story. The fifth movie ended rather unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers escaping from jail with the mysterious man in black. It turns out (aggh) that this man knows the origin of Micheal's evil and is also a colleague of Dr Loomis named Dr Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in parts 4 and 5 but here played by JC Brandy). Jamie pregnant escapes from Dr Wynn's lair and so Micheal follows her and kills her. But she'd had the kid so now he needs to track the baby down so he can kill his great nephew. We hear some ludicrous explanation to Micheal's evil involving Gaelic curses down bloodlines and mysterious symbols. A radio show is broadcast from Micheal's home town for some reason which gives Micheal some more hapless victims. In the end the movie just like this review is vague confusing and directionless with a very anticlimactic ending. Some sex scenes and nudity. Poor plot passable effects with some good run of the mill slasher kills but severely lacking in motivation. For what was supposed to explain everything this only stirred up some new questions made parts 4 and 5 pointless and was a poor way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and career. ,negative
 Physical Evidence is one of those films that you want to like but really should be a lot better than it actually is. Developed as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia it gives the impression that all involved only made it while they were waiting for something better to come along. The premise is perfectly serviceable it's mostly technically efficient if horribly uninspired with even Henry Mancini's musacky score surprisingly pleasant but you can't help feeling that things would have turned out better if one of the leads had turned out to be the killer (as is rumoured was originally the case). As the opening scene of his little-seen personally disastrous Heat (1986) showed Reynolds has all the makings of a great screen villain. As is there are few surprises and a feeling of half-hearted filming by numbers as it builds up a head of intertia as it ambles disinterestedly towards a less than grand will-this-do? finale. Reynolds is fine sailing through on charisma in what is clearly a star vehicle. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of Theresa Russell. An impressive and fearless actress in husband Nic Roeg's films which allow her to delve into the darker side of human nature she's trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth and she ain't got it in spades. She doesn't fluff her lines or bump into the other actors but that's about all that can be said in favour of her astonishingly stilted and often amateurish performance that lets the film down badly. Aside from Ned Beatty's prosecutor the supporting cast add only a slightly surreal presence in a Boston where everyone seems to have a badly disguised Canadian accent and the streets bear a startling resemblance to Toronto and Montreal. Likewise director Michael Crichton who in Westworld Coma and The First Great Train Robbery showed that he knew how to lean an audience to the edge of their seats seems to handle the action in a purely perfunctory fashion - indeed in one brief chase the shots don't even match and seem thrown together almost arbitrarily. The climax itself has no flair and is completely bereft of threat or danger and many scenes are played for far less than they are worth. It's no great surprise that aside from uncredited reshoots on The 13th Warrior Crichton hasn't directed since. Its watchable enough in an 80s TV movie sort of way even if it never lives up to the promise of its opening. Whether that's enough of a reason to see it is down to individual taste. ,negative
 The first users comments are very detailed for a very vague movie. Not saying that I disagree but this summary can be written in a few sentences. To get straight to the point this is pretty much like watching the making of a really bad amateur porno flick. There are a few funny points in the movie but with the kind of things that happen in todays youth everyday its actually kind of lame. The main actor in the movie is a pompous jackass and both guy and girl in the film are way too modest to be in a film like this. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least a somewhat attractive girl in the movie and towards the end you got to see almost full frontal nudity from the girl thats it thats the only thing thats worth watching it for. the end ,negative
 Although I found the acting excellent and the cinematography beautiful I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation. One of the significant portions of the novella is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decide to kill themselves rather than go on. This is never presented in the movie they show it as if it were a sledding accident. The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost non-existent. While in the novella they almost change places at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both invalids. Lastly that Mattie and Ethan consummate their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and poignancy of the finale. The change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change. Neeson and Arquette are superb in their portrayals. Joan Allen was also wonderful however her character was much watered down from Whartons novella. I do not expect films to faithfully portray novels but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story. Overall I would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed. ,negative
 The one line summary is actually the punch line of a very old joke that begins what is a Jewish porno film? While this film had its interesting moments it was far too slow moving and did not do enough to explain to those of us in the audience unfamiliar with orthodox Jewish custom exactly what was going on and why? How many people who came across this film would know that the bathtub the female characters were washing in is in reality called a Mikveh which is a ritual bath used to cleanse spiritual uncleanliness? The same question might be asked of why the bride was walked around the groom a dizzying number of times while her face was covered just prior to the marriage vows being performed. These two examples are but two of a large number of such moments that remained completely unexplained to the uninitiated audience. This film does have its touching moments along with expressions of great love and emotions. The characters are presented very authentically right down to the number of garments an ultra orthodox Jewish male must wear as well as the religious rituals he must engage in upon awakening in the morning to begin his day. The attitudes orthodox Judaism has towards women in general and wives in particular is both intriguing and at times maddening. This is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context. I recommend this film to people who are familiar with orthodox Jewish tradition and ritual as well as those who might be interested in getting a brief peek at what the lives of people who practice this way of life is like. The story itself about two sisters who in their own ways rebel against the system is of moderate interest at best. ,negative
 Watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there. Let me say most of the other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing bad acting and bad directing. I too had liked Russell and Pare back in the old days and was very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review I mentioned that I lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich yet still watching the movie from the kitchen. When I did return to the living room I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded. I even rewound it to make sure I was not missing anything. This film totally crapped out on how to do a twist ending. I suspect that the idea sounded good maybe the script was intriguing but the budget was so non-existent that sets were really lacking. And yes I suppose all those bad sets were an effort to give the viewer a clue. All it told me was low budget. Anyway the reason I came here was because over the weekend I saw a review of Shutter Island and with what the reviewers were saying or not saying lead me to believe that Shutter Island is the same deal only with a budget 50 to 60 times more! (Actually I have no idea how much Dark World cost but I HOPE they didn't spend more than 1 million!) So that being said I kinda thought that if someone reworked the script a bit got a bigger budget for a better look (whether that meant a better scenic designer or better post coloring just someone with a vision ) they could remake Dark World into a passable product. Now it sounds like Shutter Island is doing that. Looks like they got the vision right but the scripting could still be off. Money can't buy everything but it should in Hollywood! PS My 2 star rating is for Russell and Pare. ,negative
 This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight. The fights are not of high standards. They are way too simple in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. The coach yells do this and do that with no success. And after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. This results in a turning point in the fight although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point. Think about the Rocky movies and you'll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes. The fights are also shot poorly. There final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance. Cheesy music and awkward moments are not what I call entertainment. These guys really could have made some quality entertainment but the director wasn't up to the task. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget I don't know but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10. ,negative
 This movie reeks. No money no acting no nothing. I caught this on on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it. This movie has nothing to recommend it. I can't believe it ever got released to US television! Nobody in this movie can act their way out of a paperbag. The lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face the special effects consist of a worm-like handpuppet monster ... I can't even begin to tell you how rock-bottom this production is. It looks like it cost maybe $50 000 to shoot but only because it is on 16mm and that is probably a generous estimate! Anyway I lost interest rapidly and had to settle for watching Matlock reruns instead of finishing it. That's how BAD this movie is!!! ,negative
 An unbelievable plot laughable characters and obvious errors (in one scene where several grass huts are supposed to be burning a gas torch can be seen repeatedly trying to ignite one of the huts) this film is a real dog. ,negative
 Yes this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles. Shot in Toronto it's yet another '80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. Into this mix comes the myth of Wild Thing a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper the local crime lord (Robert Davi). Stir in the local do-gooders (priest Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan) and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences. Davi is the standout amongst the cast and cinematographer Rene Verzier does a pretty good job. Otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that won't satisfy action fans and will leaves Sayles' admirers slack-jawed. ,negative
 After watching Caddyshack 1 I'd heard there was a sequel and decided to look it up. The movie seemed pretty bad and I told myself to stay away but stupid me gave in and actually bought the damn thing! All the reviews and everything bad you've heard about Caddyshack II are true. The movie is simply worn of ideas and the lamest plot and jokes I've ever heard the gopher the acting the whole movie really is bad (Randy Quaid was funny though). Just stay away from this movie as much as you can is all I can really say. I deeply regret watching and buying the DVD but not sure which was the worser decision. Just stay away as much as possible. ,negative
 This film was released in the UK under the name Blood Rites. It was banned outright and never submitted again for release. As The Ghastly Ones it was supposedly a hit with the horror hungry denizens of New York City's famed 42nd Street Grindhouse circuit. If you are looking for some bloody horror then you will find it in this film. Unfortunately to see the developmentally disabled Colin (Hal Borske) chomp down on a live rabbit you have to put up with shaky 16mm camera work that makes Ed Wood look positively marvelous. Three sisters are to spend three days in the family homestead with their husbands before the old man's money is disbursed. Naturally in such a situation people start dropping dead. Family secrets are exposed and lots of blood is spilled especially during a gruesome dismemberment. Maybe it was the bunny bit that the Brits objected to I know I did. ,negative
 Firstly I am a huge fan of crap films. B grade is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately this film is just plain bad. I dressed up as a Zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film. Especially the big guy at the beginning it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons. The acting is so bad I need not comment on why. The effect are also extremely amateurish with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot. It also seems many people commenting on this movie are trying to boost the rating. Nobody without their finger in the pie would rate this film above a 5/10. Frankly it is disgraceful that people who worked on this film are boosting their own ratings. I suggest everyone avoid this movie it isn't worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life. Absolutely awful. ,negative
 Junior and his dad start a new life in a new town. It's the same life because Junior hasn't changed one bit. He is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger. This time he has a pal named Trixie and she is only slightly worse. Junior doesn't like his dad dating and messes up every opportunity that he has. Then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. I thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end. This is a movie for the most immature people. It has diapers farts doggy do do and toilet humor in it. Only someone under the age of twelve would find this to be super hilarious. I hope when I have a son he is exactly like Junior. ,negative
 I love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great American sitcom. I watched five episodes of this abomination and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job. The rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom. I loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots (one who got laid and the other who didn't) getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students. The British girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass. The hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot and the principal and her lackey that served to somehow move the almost non-existent plot forward. I loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young but I ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had . . . did they look like that? Or did you go to the high school that had middle-aged people teaching in it? That is the high school that everyone else went to. The show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools. In public schools principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers the school board does but in every episode that I watched the principal made threats to fire her teachers. Think back to your history class . . . . . or think of any history class did you ever see an incredibly hot British chick teach an American History class? No. Did you ever see a teacher's lounge that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in? No. Teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality. What makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out. The overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines and I'm sorry I just didn't buy it. The show could have modeled itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single-camera format and it should have centered more around the teacher's relationships with their students and not with each other. It gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick (she was really hot). In the end it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession. I only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen. ,negative
 I am very interested in animal children and I have read many Edger Rice Burroughs novels -- but this awful movie couldn't keep me interested nor could I stomach all the absurd unrealistic scenes. I only managed to sit through the Africa part and John's first few days in Scotland. Let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'downright silly'! The actors in ape suits looked like extra large chimps rather than great apes (there is a difference). They did not move with the grace that a wild animal would. (For comparison see some of the better Planet of the Apes movies where they trained their actors to move in simian fashion). The apes eat large haunches of meat -- not a common ape practice as far as I know. I am a sucker for animal stories but the script did not make me care about the apes. The great white hunters of the expedition that finds John Clayton are charicaturish entirely. The parents of Clayton were shipwrecked on an ocean beach but somehow it is a very long trip down the river to get to the coast -- give me a break! Let's talk about 'slow'. Even the folks who think this is an excellent movie admit that it is not an action movie. Far from it. It tries to be a character study -- unfortunately the downright silly part predominates! I did not read Burroughs' Tarzan books but many of his other series -- they were packed with meaningful action and heroic purpose! This film just isn't there. ,negative
 I actually own this movie which is the MST3K version called Cave Dwellers which is really the only way anyone could really watch a movie like this. If it weren't for Joel Crow and Tom Servo constantly making wisecracks it wouldn't be possible to sit through this piece of crap. You have a hero called Ator who looks a lot like Jeff Spigoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and appears only slightly more intelligent just without being stoned. He takes on cavemen (the cave dwellers?) invisible guys a giant snake (with a bunch of anal retentive snakes that like to line up all the skulls to face the same way) invents a hang glider which suspiciously looks like a modern aluminum one with some cheap vines wrapped around it and then does battle with the evil John Saxon-looking dude. Then he rides off on his horse across the tire tracks where someone's been four-wheeling. Yes I got most of that from MST3K which as I said is the only way to watch this turkey of a movie. If it weren't for that it would get zero stars. ,negative
 Anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say fake . it's never been disproved also is a weak argument. Saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. Although to be fair it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in Zambia. No bones of any primates are have been found in the United States or Canada. There is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother studying this. The same argument goes for the Loch Ness monster ghosts and god. ,negative
 Assault on Precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest film I've seen since Charlie's Angels 2. The shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with. SPOILERS ............................................................. I know they've said this movie is a remake descendant of Rio Bravo but did the writers of this film actually watch Rio Bravo? Besides the fact that Rio Bravo is a western classic the premise of the film was that the sheriff (John Wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being liberated by his brother and his gang. No one wants to liberate anyone in Assault on Precinct 13. They want EVERYONE dead. So my first question would have to be WHY NOT JUST BURN THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN FROM THE START? Why assault the place at all? I know the contrived plot turn was suppose to be clever and shocking but it didn't make sense and/or was presented properly. If the veteran cop was in on it from the start why the need for this whole movie? If the veteran cop suddenly cut a deal at the back door during the siege how did he even get the chance? As soon as he appeared at the door he would've been shot and they would've had their entry point. It's all just FUBAR. What part of any city can an all out war take place at a police precinct (complete with helicopters and massive explosions) but no one notices?? However as soon as there's a fire they have to leave before the fire department shows up ?????? How did they plan to cover up the chaos that was happening outside?? Police issue bullets in the walls bullet casings footprints equipment usage and the fact that there were going to be no bodies of Bishop's men to be found? How about those police snipers? How could they possibly miss so badly so often? I like the fact that when the two detainees tried to run the snipers were foiled by two tiny mounds of snow. As if it's not possible to shoot a high powered riffle through a pile of snow. The set up was interesting although ridiculous but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet to the head for absolutely NO REASON at all. I know the makers of the film were going for shock but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and the anger of the audience. Don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from this one? That particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth (that and the fact that every plot turn is dumber then dirt). The conclusion remains steadily stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an Austin Powers-like diatribe instead of killing the helpless people who he has finally captured. I know several people have mentioned the closing scenes that take place in the woods of Detroit city (>snicker<) but why did Ethan's character just wander off in to the woods in the first place? He doesn't even look to see if the SUV with the secretary and his friend gets away? They just cut to him prowling slowly in the woods pistol in hand. GACK. I could go on but won't. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all cost. ,negative
 Celebrity singers have always had a tough time breaking into the movies (the cinema is littered with failed attempts) and one can go on and on speculating why John Mellencamp never made it big as an actor. Instead of taking small parts in heartfelt projects Mellencamp dives right in playing the lead in Falling From Grace which he also directed and the results are as awkward and unbecoming as that title. Story of a famous singer returning to his hometown in the sticks opening up old family wounds boasts a screenplay by Larry McMurtry but the meandering film goes nowhere slowly. The supporting cast is decent including Kay Lenz (whom it's always nice to see) Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share the one really strong scene in the picture). As for John's acting he doesn't look particularly comfortable despite apparent efforts to make him look at home; he seems to be ducking the camera most of the time and he never connects with the audience in an immediate way. *1/2 from **** ,negative
 That's what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick. We couldn't believe how stupid it was! I think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and snuck it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up. Well I guess the joke is on us. I guess I should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten every single one says this movie is HORRIBLE STUPID and on and on. And boy are they right! Although it did provide some pretty good laughs (me and my friends were pretty drunk) because it is so stupid. We just can't believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie! I swear this had to be made in the 70's before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy but when I looked on here it said it was made in 2001? What? It sure doesn't look like a movie that would be made today but I guess that's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using strobe lights and really fake looking lasers and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors. BTW-some of those chicks (or were they drag queens we couldn't tell!) were so fugly even my drunk horny college buddies wouldn't touch them with a 50-foot pole. So there's absolutely no appeal to this movie at all bad acting bad writing bad directing bad special effects bad bad bad. Don't waste your time or money on this one you'll be completely disappointed! ,negative
 Inglourious Basterds IS Tarantino's worst film he has ever made. It's full of his usual ingredient's i.e. snappy dialogue brutal and sudden violence but it all feel's deja-vu. The directing is typical Tarantino and nothing seem's new at all. It's almost as if he's copied exactly from his only masterpiece Pulp Fiction. There is nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds to be honest it's just a war drama that isn't funny nor brilliant as Pulp Fiction was. Basterds supposedly is Tarantino's tribute to Leone's Spaghetti western's but seem's mis-jointed and out of place especially with the continuing use of big sub-titles and throw's the audience of balance. ,negative
 Be warned the next time you see Richard Kelly involved in any production run away. Fast. Kelly proved to the world after his last movie Southland Tales that he is one pretentious director. It was indulgent and convoluted. In The Box not much has changed. I can picture what his pitch to Warner Bros must have been and I bet the executives at the studio ate it right up: a full-feature film based on one of Richard Twilight Zone Matheson's old short stories. Big mistake! Do not read any further unless you want this movie COMPLETELY spoiled for you: Norma (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button. Turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien using his body as a vessel to conduct experiments in which the fate of mankind rests. His face is scarred because he was struck by Alien lightening which killed him but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing. Obviously since Norma pushes the button knowing full well that someone may die she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own. In the end she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind. Kelly dances around his film's message trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is. Obviously any person with a brain is saying at the beginning What if I was the person who dies? . Richard Kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal HUMAN conversation. In fact they avoid it all together. They appear to both be educated working at a prestigious school and also for NASA so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX??? If he had the main characters actually have this conversation the entire movie could have ended right there! Instead we have to watch weddings go on forever NASA and the NSA be complacent to Arlington Stewart taking over these government programs teleportation to show Marsden life beyond our world so it will be easier to kill his wife and drone's controlled by Steward which can be anywhere and nowhere at any time. The most painful part of this movie is the pacing. Nothing really happens. Its a muddled mish-mash of ideas that are laughable. It is insufferable how this film is being marketed. The commercials make it look like Saw and even use the music from those films to sell it. In reality what you get is a slow dull laughable (yes half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects) and messy film which is neither imaginative interesting nor cohesive. At one point Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on the way home. Where did she go? Why did they take her? Do we really care? Not anymore you won't. By the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters. You will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end. Go see anything else that's playing. Don't waste your time or money. ,negative
 I bought this thing used at a video game store's clearance bin . I wanted to get that guilty feeling from watching something I've been warned is too intense to watch; I wanted the shock value. I wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a banned film . I was very disappointed. Cannibal Ferox does not work because it is so campy and fake. Most of the time the camera does not show you the shocking stabs chops slicing - you just see the aftermath. (They do show a breast hooking in detail). The special effects are just OK. Nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real. The cannibals are obviously poor people from central / south America who were dressed up as jungle savages and told to act mean. These people were obviously in on the whole picture to get a little money or food or both. Again...just not convincing. However like everyone else has said there is some real killing of animals going on here. That is the extent of the realism. To me that was more shocking than any gutting chopping of scalps or castration and even then the animal deaths are not that gory at all - maybe just sad. ,negative
 Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly routine outdoor yarn The Yellow Tomahawk (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white. The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of Black Spurs ) eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of The Good The Bad and the Ugly ) who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant Major Ives (Warner Anderson of Objective Burma! ) about the impending Indian attack Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of I Jury ) is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes too perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim 82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack knock out of hero and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of Stalag 17 ) brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery Jr. plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of West Side Story ) and Robert Bray of Lassie fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab Utah is that the evil cavalry officer Ives who slaughtered Indian men women and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American too! Ironically the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. The Yellow Tomahawk concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost Fort Ellis where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to Casablanca scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately The Yellow Tomahawk is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of Broken Arrow (1950) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. Actually Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called War Paint (1953) with Robert Stack. Incidentally Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regulars on The Rockford Files . ,negative
 Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story starts off ok. Her husband cheats on her and she finds out on national television. So she has to rebuild her life. Here it could have gotten interesting or built up in a story line but you become so bored with it. She moves back with her parents and Harry Connick Jr. who plays Justin begins hitting on her. The two have no real chemistry at all yet your supposed to get the impression that Justin is in love with her. The movie ends the way you figure it will but you wish it hadn't ended like every other kind like it. They had a good start with this movie and could have turned it into something watchable but instead its a movie that you definitely want to miss. ,negative
 It was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was horrible the plugs for the directors other movie that seemed to happen every other minute the video of the actual ghost hunting was edited like a scary movie rather than an investigation they had haunted house music and sound effects that would distract you from what was happening. THanks for wasted 2 hours of my time! When there was evidence it would fly by! Most of it was just people talking about the place.The episode of the Ghosthunters show that went there absolutely destroys how this show was. I am so upset with sci fi channel for playing this I haven't watched it since it aired. ,negative
 Warning Might contain spoilers i just sadly spent 5 bucks on this movie on amazon and i wish i never spent it. I have never seen suck horrible special affects or acting. I mean Jack-0 is just a laughable monster and his costume looks like something u could buy at a Halloween store or make yourself. The acting is just horrible especially Sean Kelly i mean come on he is so pathetic with his little lines COme get me PUmpkinman low i laughed so hard on this its just stupid. I mean the movie is so awful they had to put a few minutes of nudity in it just for people not to shut it off low. I think the most laughable scene is when the woman sticks a butter knife in the toaster and gets electrocuted. I mean come on that looked so fake and the dummy i could buy that at any Halloween store or make it myself. Well I recommend not watching this cheesy movie cause it will be time you will never get back. ,negative
 1st watched 2/9/2008 4 out of 10(Dir-J.S. Cardone): Sexual political thriller that doesn't really succeed in any of these areas very well except early on where there are some interesting soft-core scenes. The movie starts off portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies amidst their work environments or wherever and whatever suits their fancy. The couple takes an excursion to a retreat and bathhouse where they run into a woman that's willing to be a part of a three-some and fulfill some of their fantasies. At this point we only know that this couple is well off but we don't know until they return that the fiancé is part of a well-to-do political family. The man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a congressional seat after the marriage. They then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter at the bath house and their qwest begins as to how and why they were filmed who sent the package what they want and how to clear their names before any of this gets out. This qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into seedier worlds and takes a lot of their time to the point where their friends & family wonder what they're doing all day and why they look rundown all the time. This movie is interesting at times but drifts into ridiculousness as they personally seek out the problem instead of getting the police involved early on because of their pride. This mistake of course keeps the movie going. The performances are fine despite the no-name cast but the lunacy of the situation overrides and the movie starts to become ho-hum about ½ the way through. And of course they throw in a twist at the end that defies and challenges everything that happened prior(as is the norm these days when they don't know what else to do to spice up the movie). This doesn't help this movie one bit though. ,negative
 This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. A friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret. Ehh... Where to start? The writing the acting the quality? All of it sucked. Quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. The dialog was worse than I thought it could ever be in the movies. Blatant dialog such as how ya doing? ... not that great doc (directly after an attempted exorcism of a man's daughter and then his wife's attempted suicide. Of course he's not that great.) was at some points kind of funny. If not horribly written planned out and obvious. The general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked HORRIBLE. It was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could. The only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed & Peirced girl) was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film. Oh yeah and they never actually got the deed done. The acting? Horrible. x100. I think the only good actor was the short Spanish guy who played Miguel Del Zamora. And his part was written horribly. The worst acting? Arguably Paul Kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through. He even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail. Although most everybody else's acting was horrible as well. The lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie. There were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldn't be counted on one hand. Like... 50 thumbs down. P.S. What IS it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways? ,negative
 This movie was so horrible...I want to beat the hell out of who ever made this movie...I was a original fan of all the ghoulies movies...but when i seen this i just began to cry I could not handle it..There are not even ne ghoulies in it...like the original creative monsters...this is so friggen cheap...I meen come on a witch...thats bull crap no one wants to see the witch...they wanted to see what the movie is about... GHOULIES i meen jeesh am i right or what? Thats y we watched the other ones..now we have to actually put up with this horrible storyline...This makes me want to eat my own poop after Spaghetti Monday!!! ,negative
 The story has little to do with Jack London's original novel. I thought the acting was very unnatural the dubbing was done very sloppily and the story itself contains a fairly large number of inconsistencies and loose ends. Apart from that the pace of the movie was horrendously slow at some parts. ,negative
 I wasn`t expecting much with HARLEM NIGHTS but I wasn`t expecting it to be as bad as it was . Without doubt the worst aspect is the obscene language it really is awful the amount there is in this film and before anyone accuses me of being a wimp let me point out two things... 1 ) Amongst my fave films I would include GOODFELLAHS PLATOON RAGING BULL while my favourite movie of all time is APOCALYPSE NOW 2 ) My all time favourite American television show is the HBO prison drama OZ so you see films and television shows with massive amounts of swearing don`t normally bother me but the problem I had with HARLEM NIGHTS is to do with the fact it`s supposed to be a comedy but it seems the production team came to the conclusion that an audience laugh everytime someone ( Especially if that someone is black ) says a rude word and decided to subsitute funny situations with swearing all the way through the film hoping to get a laugh. Well I thought I`d never start laughing and I didn`t ,negative
 Teenage Exorcist is one of those God-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics adolescent humour and empty writing. This film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. It is about a girl moving into a house where a Baron de Sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law along with an Irish priest her boyfriend and a pizza delivery boy try to save her and exorcise her demon. Well not much here in way of horror or suspense. In fact one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect. Mike(the girl's brother-in-law) has tied her(the name is Diane by the way and she is played by Brinke Stevens) up after trying to chainsaw her sister. He removes a gag from her mouth and says something like This won't be the last gag we see tonight. Indeed it was not. The special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal. Some of the lines and situations are funny. Robert Quarry old Count Yorga himself really steals his scenes as an Irish priest. He hams it up wailing Biblical verses and crooning Irish songs. You know you are in trouble however when Eddie Deezen gets top billing. Deezen does his schtick and has a couple nice moments as well but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler. Michael Berryman from The Hills Have Eyes also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film. As for the other thespians well they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre. Stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and French-cut panties but beyond that don't expect too much more from her. Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun and she shows a bit more than Brinke(a very lovely young lady by the way) and out acts Brinke by miles. Her husband played by Jay Richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity. Again not a bad film to waste a little time that involves NO thinking on. If you are a Robert Quarry fan watch it for his performance at the very least. ,negative
 Dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard. She traps him into bringing her back with him. Glynis Johns in the title role is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out. Margaret Rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here. In fact Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts. Nice to see David Tomlinson in the film. He would get together with Johns in the far superior Mary Poppins 16 years later. Miranda causes mischief in that two guys a neighbor's fiancée and chauffeur (Tomlinson) fall for her. Ask any mermaid you happen to see what's the best tuna Chicken of the Sea! As for this film forget it. ,negative
 Four things intrigued me as to this film - firstly it stars Carly Pope (of Popular fame) who is always a pleasure to watch. Secdonly it features brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Thirdly it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourthly a friend recommended it to me. However I was utterly disappointed. The whole storyline is absurd and complicated with very little resolution. Pope's acting is fine but Owen is unfortunately under-used. The other actors and actresses are all okay but I am unfamiliar with them all. Aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie (and Pope and Owen) this film isn't very good. So the moral of the story is...don't watch it unless you really want to. ,negative
 In his feature film debut `Yellow ' Chris Chan Lee attempts to enlighten Hollywood's portrayal of Asian-Americans by departing from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream film. However in so doing Lee commits a far more heinous crime: he exaggerates Asian-Americans' own stereotypes of themselves to the point of incredulity. The result? Dreadfully one-dimensional characters and an outrageously shallow script triggers the cast into a frenzy of over-acting ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to watch. Don't be deceived by any of the positive reviews garnered by `Yellow'; each falls into one of two camps. In one corner (e.g. right here on imdb.com) you find Asian-Americans who are so elated that an Asian character can be depicted onscreen without thick glasses and a math book that they somehow neglect the idiocy of Lee's final product. On the other hand you find movie critics who have simply presumed that it'd be uncool to give `Yellow' the thorough bashing that it deserves; after all it's an edgy Asian-American film made by an independent Asian-American filmmaker... protected territory for now. Case example: main character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). Writer/Director Lee accomplishes a monumental feat with Sin by editing `Yellow' in such a way that Sin never appears onscreen unless he is either scowling or yelling. See Sin resenting his friends' support. Scowl. See Sin walk along the beach and brood. Scowl. (Yelling ensues.) See Sin closing up his father's shop. Scowl. See Sin urinating. Scowl. See Sin breathing. Scowl. Gee I wonder if Sin is full of Asian-American angst. Do you think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Scowl. Just to be thorough Lee introduces us to Sin's father Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the movie whereas Sin simply scowls or yells Mr. Lee scowls *and* yells. In fact this is Woon's principal role in `Yellow': simultaneous scowling and yelling. Gee I wonder if Woon is an Asian father with an authority complex. Do you think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Yell. If Lee's one-dimensional characters don't annoy you his story line will. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho) two characters that exist in this film solely for the purpose of spinning a tangential and entirely irrelevant love story into the film. You see Lee learned in film school that every good movie must include some sort of love-related subtext and these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation. Mina and Joey's excruciatingly inane flirting dialogue consists of one-liner insults culminating in a kiss: `Nerd!'; `Stupidhead!'; (eyes meet); (understanding smile); (kissing ensues). But rest assured somewhere out there Sin is scowling while this all takes place. That neither Mina nor Joey contributes in any way whatsoever to the film's plot does not perplex me so much as Lee's insistence on the most hackneyed movie cliches to accomplish his nonsequiturs. And trust me the flirting sequence is just the tip of the iceberg. Towards the end of the film we find Woon Lee attempting to explain his constant scowling and yelling to Sin's girlfriend Teri (Mia Suh) in what I am sure Lee meant to be a poignant moment. What a surprise: as Woon invokes a metaphorical story about the homeland to illustrate his point ripped straight out of Reader's Digest his voice quivers in that extra-special paternal way. The camera pans into an obligatory shot of Teri's trembling hands. We feel compelled to roll our eyes except we realize that Woon's explanation makes no sense whatsoever. But lack of substance didn't stop Lee from making the movie so why would he cut this particularly ineffective scene? After all the world can always use another cliché. Well you say the movie may be painful but at least it *must* be a technical masterpiece -- say like `What Dreams May Come.' Sorry on a technical basis `Yellow' disappoints as well. Lee's edits are awkward and disrupt what little rhythm exists in the film at all but I'm sure Lee thought they would seem hip. To make matters worse every frame is either underexposed or overexposed. Although the light meter was invented in 1932 somehow the newfangled technology didn't make it onto the `Yellow' set. In light of the film's utter deficiency supporting actor Burt Bolos who plays Sin's best friend Alex performs relatively well. Although Bolos overacts slightly you can't really blame him when Lee's script consists solely of scowling and yelling. Bolos' castmates on the other hand show no restraint in their overacting whatsoever. I have not seen a film as bad as `Yellow' in a very long time. And I truly pray that I will not see a film as bad as `Yellow' for quite some time as well. Please do not waste see it; life is already way too short. Thank you. ,negative
 This could quite possibly be the worst movie ever made up there in a league with movies like Howard the Duck Plan 9 From Outer Space and Ishtar. I don't understand why I decided to see this movie as it was a waste of my life. I also do not understand why one would like this movie regardless of their sense of humor. The acting is among the worst I've ever seen as is the writing. The characters are all stupid and there is not one funny scene in the entire movie. Tom Arnold is quite possibly the worst actor ever-- this movie proves it. There is nothing worthy about this movie. Don't rent it don't watch it don't even say that it looks interesting. It's bad enough I saw it. ,negative
 It is apparent that director writers and everyone else knows nothing about their own religion or the people who practice it. This movie is endlessly flawed and overall a complete crock. For instance there is a scene where the rabbi enters the woman's ritual bath while a naked woman is bathing puts his hand on the head of a woman there and blesses her. This is complete mockery of the laws in this scene alone some of the laws broken include: Modesty a rabbi would never enter a ritual bath house while there are woman in it. Improper contact a rabbi would never put his hand on a woman's head not to mention that it is not the way a blessing is given. The woman from the ritual bath is dunking a naked woman by pushing her head under the water the laws regarding ritual bathing require the entire body to make direct contact with the bath water; this means nobody should be in contact with the person bathing certainly not pushing them under! There was more just in that scene alone like dunking 13 times (where does that concept even come from?) not to mention the rest of the movie was a total fallacy. It is scary what ignorance can concoct! ,negative
 Okay first the good thing : If you saw the trailer then you know about 100% of the scary/jumpy moment of the movie. And yes it's a good thing because you should just stick to the trailer and not go see the movie. I now understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar did not stay alive in that movie for very long she did not want to associate her name with this production. I wish her the best for The Return . You have to follow 3 different story in this movie and they are all disconnected (in time and meaning) until the very end. And even then it's a very bad climax. And god forbid even open the door to another sequel. Yes in this movie The Rage and Fury is on the move. No need to visit the house anymore just be close to someone who when inside and you're done. It's not a curse anymore it's kinda like a virus. Go inside the house get scared return back to USA and spread the joy in your apartment building. It's not that difficult to follow but you just don't really care about anyone. The plot line is slim to none and you have many scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head... Milk anyone?? I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia movie festival last summer different story completely but much better than this dud. It's not a remake but this time maybe they should have simply done a remake.... If you must see it wait for the DVD. ,negative
 It's difficult to make it through this movie without choking on your own vomit to be honest. The shoddy animation doesn't help as it makes this look like a decades-old video you'd find in Morrisons's 99p bin. Still it's better than the abysmal screenplay which spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras like Belle's present day problems stuff about Scrooge's dad and plenty of charmless fannying around with - choke - TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC MICE. These bizarre additions eat up screen time at the expense of elements you'd think would be quite important like Dickens's dialogue and key chunks of his plot - the movie buggers up the game of twenty questions for example and at times fails to put scenes in the right order. Absolutely hopeless. ,negative
 Hi today i looked this film because of the medium (5 6) IMDb rating. I thought it would worth viewing. Also the comments here were quiet good but after start watching this movie i quick realize that this movie isn't anyway near a 5 6 ! Its just boring. You can describe the movie with some words also its just the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes. I don't know why people still like those films or why they vote such films better then a 1-3 in IMDb. Just some examples Bunch of people arriving from somewhere or going / driving to anywhere. They meet somehow on their journey strange people but hey maybe they are just nice so hang out with them. Then a very important scene for every horror movie Oh my cell phone isn't working oh oh mine too .. is that strange but we don't need them so enjoy our ride ... uhhhhhh our strange person is a strange psychopath better we all sit back and scream a while till he starts cutting parts from us or killing some of us. After a while the bunch of victims get a weapon or chance to escape ofcorse they never think about running away or even kill the psychopath if they got the chance they just talk about what to do until the psychopath got his weapon back with any of the handful of standard tricks they got in those films and all running back as usual ... screaming ... some more to kill ... oh and in the end it gets really exiting sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes some of the victim can escape wow great movies. ... OK if i never ever saw a movie of that kind i would say it is a movie which can be watched but if anyone ever saw any movie of its kind it should be just a boring waste of time because nearly everything in the movie you know before you even watched it because it every time runs like the standard horror movie shematic. .... mmm maybe there is a windows program out there? Horrormoviemaker 2.0 ? You can just pull some adjustment buttons and get the new Shuttle Saw45674 Jeepers Creepers kind of movie. ,negative
 Season on the Brink is one of my favorite books of all time - an insightful unflinching look at Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. So I made a point of watching this adaptation. It disappointed on every level. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired and he seemed unprepared to play Knight - like he had accepted the role just prior to filming. The rest of the cast isn't much better. And it was obvious that this was ESPN's first movie. It was poorly directed poorly filmed and the lack of budget was obvious anytime games were being simulated (smaller gyms empty seats etc.) Skip this adaptation and read the book - it holds up well to this day! ,negative
 As I am a fan of hospital and medical shows I have found this one gripping and sometimes humorous (especially the scenes with Dr Whitman) which brings a bit la light relief. However I was looking forward to the last episode because I expected that the bad ones would be punished and the good ones reinstated. Instead of that the hospital management are making even more fools of themselves in an unbelievable manner and it's getting worse and worse for the good ones. You can't help wondering what the unions are doing or doesn't Rob Donna and Maria know what unions are there for ? Besides never seeing the outside trees grass sunlight is a bit oppressive. Anyone understood what the last words were ? i.e. the answer Rob Lake gave to Mrs Strawberry's children question Why are you telling us all that? It was very frustrating not to be able to understand it. ,negative
 'Book II' isn't a film it's a sermon. This nauseating sickly and almost unbearably tedious misfire probably works as religious propaganda but has no entertainment value beyond a few wisecracks from George Burns. Louanne plays a little girl who is asked by (ahem) God to mount an advertising campaign that will get people to believe in him again. No really that is the story. It's a leaden load of old cobblers that has far too much self-justifying 'explanatory' religious waffle but barely any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything even approaching magic or charm. 'Miracle On 34th Street' this ain't. Suzanne Pleshette breathes a bit of life into this rancid puddle of quick-setting concrete but the pudding-headed script and rubbish performance by the irksome Louanne quickly send this one down to the fiery depths of you-know-where. ,negative
 First off I just want to say that this show could've done well way better than it's doing now. What brought it down was certainly the acting. Miranda Cosgrove who acts as the main character Carly looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on Drake and Josh. Unfortunately iCarly was a big let down. Not only can Miranda not act convincingly enough but she's incredibly stiff when she moves. She looks as if she's not sure how the character carly would move or stand. In the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up her arm doesn't ever leave her side from her elbow up. even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze. And the singing? The theme song was great only because Drake had been in it the music was pretty good and Miranda's voice sounded fake. I have to admit the plot and settings are good unrealistic but hey that's Nick. They're practically known for stupid lines and characters. But wow is iCarly the worst of them all. ,negative
 I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode it said To Be Continued to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing. It ended as it was supposed to so yes you can blame the series for having no ending. The plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher but it was a boring show that way too long and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would so they never made any more. Quite a few of the comments blame its cancellation and lack of ending on the viewing public when the truth is that for this show that is not the case it ended the way it was actually planned to end it is just a lousy ending. ,negative
 Sure you get to see some boobies but if that's all you're looking for in a film you get more mileage from youtube. I just paid a dollar from redbox because I saw Val Kilmer's name. Bad move. Plot didn't thicken dialogue was shoddy characters undeveloped at best. Somebody said cinematography was alright but don't expect too much. This movie moved very slow and ended without grace. Blacklist. I spent much of the movie wondering if some event or color scheme of things was symbolic. I never actually rewound to figure it out because nothing was ever explained in the end. No twists. It also left many questions that as it turns out I had no desire to hear answered. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. ,negative
 The basic story idea of ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To further defray costs they get two other strangers to come along. What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. Unfortunately this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous. Her doe-eyed expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot! And to make it worse Reginald Owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that I was very close to turning off the film--he was that awful and unbelievable. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10--which is very very difficult to understand. Sure the film has great ambiance and a good plot but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture. Sorry but this film was aching for a re-make! ,negative
 Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx and what do you get? You receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of Magoo-like madness. The limited plot has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) put into an international plot where he steals a world-renowned gem. Of course he has no idea what he is doing. In fact he has no idea that he had the gem. Within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. There are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken. You will wish that you were as nearsighted as Magoo. Its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster! You have to love Leslie Nielson because he was made some very funny movies. This isn't his best but he does a good job playing Magoo. I thought it was a funny film and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny. ,negative
 Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film. The acting directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star Larry Bishop to get laid. The only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with QT. The plot of the film is pretty flimsy and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos from guys like David Carradine Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each one is listless in their performance particularly Hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career. The saving grace if there is one is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining. Bishop tries so hard to get that trademark Tarentino banter and just fails miserably which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others. I'd only check this one out if you love bad movies...or if you're really into biker films. ,negative
 Usually when BBC releases a TV series one is used to a certain satisfaction guarantee. Usually the TV series is splendid even if the story is boring you can trust the acting will make the it worth while. When I came across Persuasion here at the local library I was looking forward to an enjoyable evening cause I read the story. I'm glad I read the story first otherwise I would not think highly of it. Further was I relieved to learn that the production date of this TV series was from 1971 since I thought until that moment that BBC had lost it. It is really bad and should be used in acting schools as a horror movie. The only positive thought I have about this series that the people in this film are not likely to appear or be involved in any BBC or other product this century other than the young Musgroves sisters who apparently were taking their fist steps in acting and doing remarkably well under the direction otherwise given. ,negative
 The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders and a few minutes later he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life he would be in shock. And as usual in thrillers the assassin doesn't kill the heroes giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens ha ha) and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting You are going to be blown up . Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magic place and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly. ,negative
 For an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10 but in general it only gets a 3. The effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of indy low budget horror films do. The acting is very wooden but at least they had a better display than some films in the shoestring budget category. It's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement. The plot as a whole isn't the worst. It's a Resident Evil rip off about an evil corporation invading a small town and an outbreak makes people into zombies. I would have liked to have seen some sort of creatures rather than the big baddie just be another super zombie. I try not to write spoilers but this review has one so be warned!! SPOILER ALERT!!! Not only do some of the cast just seem to shrug past the zombies (the same ones are recycled over and over but at least they have more then 5 people playing them). But one of the plot twists really doesn't fly with me. The deputy who goes inside turns out to be on the evil corporations payroll. He kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets with the head bad guy in an office talking about cleaning up the mess. The deputy has just shown us that he is a real bad person too and talks like he can clean it up (meaning kill all the surviving witnesses) no problem. But then 2 seconds later he is helping them out. There was no real change of heart emotion or anything to make me feel that this bad guy went from killing an innocent guy just minutes ago and then talking about taking everyone out no problem to being their savior. There was no incident or anything to make me buy into this. Worth watching if you are a fan of low budget flicks otherwise you will not enjoy this. ,negative
 Robin Williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him. This may work if you buy into the U-S-A! Number One! mentality but story wise nothing much happens. Quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely. It just doesn't pack enough emotional punch. ,negative
 This is the worst film I've seen in a looooong time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Vegas six years ago -- without the athleticisme. By that I mean a few striking artsy images appear randomly without any sustaining framework. The fake sepia tinted film is really tacky. This device is almost never justified and certainly is not in _Tuvalu_. With apologies to Abe Lincoln: you can fool some of the people some of the time. ,negative
 This is one awful movie!! Some people told me that it was not that bad actually but I sure disagree! The monster is amazingly cheap (and funny) looking but this is something we all knew I guess. In addition to that the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible. As bad as it is this movie as the quality of being entertaining. Not always for the good reasons but it's a good so bad that it's fun flick. By the way there's no such thing as La Castagne . According to a secondary character in the film named Pierre (described in the movie as a French Canadian) there's a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird know as La Castagne . As a French Canadian myself I can assure you that I never heard of such a legend. It sure made me laugh though... :)) ,negative
 This is a parody. That means there are no characters as such they are all plain stereotypes and the movie relies completely on the quality of the jokes. Well there ARE quite some good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones. If one expects all dialogues to be absurd the fun wears off. You see there is American Pie 2 my all time favorite teenager movie. It contains a lot of real original characters. Maybe the jokes are tasteless but all the people have some kind of live. For example they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. That is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny ! Not so this movie: every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody so there are no characters at all therefore there is really no room for any sympathy. Too if you know the original movies you know whole scenes in advance. Add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all and you have this movie. The only thing that saved me from getting completely bored where in fact the comments from some teenagers in the cinema where I was watching the film. Ah and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of Melissa Joan Hart in one scene. Sigh. She is just too cool she can't be real. Hmm worth a whole movie ? ,negative
 This film was strongly recommended by a friend and being a great fan of Brando I ordered this film from Harrods and eagerly waited for it to arrive. I have seldom been so disappointed by a film. Brando was good as a German officer but the rest of the film was simply unbearable. You never get to like or care for any of the characters (except Brando maybe). The acting was OK. Story what story? Maybe that's the point. It's war after all but I've seen far better war films. (Lawrence of Arabia Apocalypse Now even Star Wars) It was so boring I kept checking my watch... Overall this is one of the worst films I have seen. Please don't waste your time and money on this. May I also add that this is the first user comment I have written I just had to let my feelings about this film known. By the way my all time favourites are: Casablanca The Godfather 1 &2 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you haven't seen them yet please spare the time to do so. And Amadeus MUST be in widescreen 2.35:1 ,negative
 I decided to watch this movie because it has been noted as the scariest movie ever so that's what I expected. Unfortunately what I found out is that the movie didn't have a single scary moment in it (and I'm the kind of person who jumps very easily). The movie was nothing but terrible clichés and every time there was a jump-moment it was incredibly obvious. The pros of this movie would be the music and the odd scene thats actually shot well (like the very last scene when she opens the door and you see Tun in the reflection and when it swings back to him you see the ghost on his shoulders). Overall this movie really added nothing new to the J-Horror genre and all-around lacked creativity and scares. ,negative
 This adorable dog (called various names during the film) is seemingly loved by the whole town...but he's alone. He is friends with two children (Cindy and Paul played astonishingly bad) but their father won't let them have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany--ANOTHER adorable dog. They (instantly) fall in love and it leads to a hysterical montage of the two of them frolicking in the grass drinking from a fountain...in slow motion no less! Also Benji lives in the cleanest abandoned house I've ever seen. Then the two kids are kidnapped by the most inept unfunniest kidnappers I've ever seen and--wouldn't you know it--they hide the brats in the exact house Benji lives in! WOW was this bad! A huge hit (for some reason) in 1974 which led to many sequels (which I will NOT see). The film is just terribly acted with humor so unfunny and badly done that you just stare at the TV in amazement. The film also has a song that is played NONSTOP during the movie--so much that you want to scream. It was inexplicably nominated for Best Song at the Oscars--it didn't win. Yeah--the dogs are adorable and much better than the human actors--but I need more than cute dogs to keep me interested. You might think I'm being a little hard on a kids film but I saw it with my 5 year old nephew. Within 20 minutes he was bored silly and basically stopped watching. I kept watching in hope that it would get better--it didn't. Really lousy--but VERY patient kids or dog lovers might like it. Note to parents: It's G rated but a dog is viciously kicked a few times. You don't see it--you just hear it and the dog survives but this might bother real young kids. ,negative
 I was loaned this DVD by the director of a film I am working with in which I play an actor who is playing Prospero. Knowing his own style I did not expect anything resembling a classical interpretation of the text. What I have found is sometimes striking sometimes evocative but often meandering and tedious. Like most experimental music I find that in films such as this the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format. Thus we have a Caliban who is more a clown than a threat and who not even Miranda seems terribly afraid of (which is odd since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once). A Stefano and Trinculo who are more annoying than funny. An oddly young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing. Interestingly enough I do not have an issue with the way in which Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate. I do not say that this is a bad film but an experimental one. One that takes huge risks but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the Tempest for its own sake. ,negative
 Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him Froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him. Okay Our Gang comedy works in fits and starts. The bits work but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down. I think in a weird way the film just sort of misses. Its the type of thing that had they actually thought about it might have amounted to something more than a misfire. Worth trying if you lower your expectations ,negative
 Basically a road movie. The gay transsexual and other gender-bender themes are rather disturbing particularly when the child is involved. You do have to hand it to the costume designers. As for the actors the only one I was familiar with was Terence Stamp. I suppose it was a very good performance out of his (or anyone's) normal range. The movie as a whole was shallow just a vehicle for the clever bitchy banter. All in all I don' recommend this one. ,negative
 This movie was a complete disaster for me. There is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable and that is *some* psychological credibility of characters... unfortunately here this is not the case. The main characters behave irrationally most of the time and even if they have some reason for such behavior it is not revealed to us by the director. Sophie Marceau's character is particularly irritating making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie when one could expect something more rational (for example meeting with her mother in the hospital)... and why exactly did she marry this guy? (no this is not a spoiler) The plot at times seems like ripped off some soap-opera and while the actors' performance is not bad this does not help much. All in all I just could not find a way to connect with this movie. Not that I tried too much after the first hour though. I have never walked out of cinema during a movie but this time was the closest in my life so far. ,negative
 He seems to be a control freak. I have heard him comment on losing control of the show and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule- no snakes. He needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. The only reason I watch him is because he some some great guests and bands. I watched the Craig Ferguson show for a while but his show is even worse. He likes to bull sh** to burn time.I don't think either man has much of a future in late night talk shows. Daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to lick his lips. He must do this at least 10 times a show. I do like the Joe Firstman band. Carson Daily needs to lighten up before it is too late. ,negative
 Snakes on a Train is a movie I rented due to the pure amusement of the thoughts I had about the movie. Snakes on a Plane was an enjoyable Action film so obviously the film makers wanted to cash in on the success with this low budget effort. At 85 minutes Snakes on a Train is almost unbearable to witness. I had to keep pausing the film to do something to entertain myself due to the lack of happenings in the film. Throughout the duration of the film it's never fully explained why this girl has this curse or why she keeps coughing up this green/purplish goo constantly. Not only that there is endless boring dialog of the two main characters Brujo and Alma discussing how to get rid of the curse. I can appreciate low budget film-making. I'm truly not picky on movies i'm open to any genre or budget but Snakes On A Train is truly one of the worst Horror films I have ever seen. Were the writers on Acid or something at the end of this film?. Why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake? and most importantly how on earth was it able to devour the train?. Bottom line. Snakes on a Train is a movie that needs to be avoided at all costs. Don't be intrigued like I was by the title this is a movie that's seriously bad. Let's put these snakes to rest 0/10 ,negative
 I haven't watched this show in months but for a while I was forced to watch it every day because I had a roommate that liked it. So maybe it's undergone some vast improvement in all that time although the commercials and the 4.2 rating on IMDb aren't a good sign. It was clearly just a quick replacement for Chappelle's Show. Even Mencia says so. And while I wasn't even that big a fan of Chappelle's Show his jokes were at least original and clever (and far edgier than Mencia has ever been). Mencia's jokes are completely unoriginal and stale. If you can't see that I guess there's just no hope for you. But to be fair here are some examples: --Mencia blatantly rips off Chapelle's Lil Jon skit. Just takes it. -- South Park makes an episode about scientology. One week later Mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientologists. Bear in mind the joke isn't ABOUT scientologists but about how much he's offended them on his show. When up to this point he has never made a single scientology joke ever. --After Hurricane Katrina two AP photos go around the Internet showing a black man looting groceries and a white woman finding them. WEEKS later after millions of people have already seen this Mencia presents it on his show as if he discovered it and it's being shown for the first time (the Daily Show would have been on something like that in a day). Pathetic. Even more annoying than the joke-stealing is the way Carlos has promoted himself and his show claiming he's breaking down some sort of PC barrier (whatever) and that if you aren't laughing you must be a weak prude who can't handle any jokes about race. Yes Carlos it's not because you're not funny it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if that was really true then why was Chappelle's Show so popular?). He constantly berates his audience for not getting it if he doesn't get enough laughs and often repeats and EXPLAINS his jokes a technique most comedians stop using by age 14. The worst part is that Mencia does not seem to be very intelligent. It's sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money. His show is supposedly the third highest rated on Comedy Central which is baffling (again it has a 4.2 rating on this site). Where the hell are they getting these numbers?? Comedy Central tries to bill itself as an edgy station but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible that will never be the case. ,negative

 Inane awful farce basically about a young man who refuses to conform or better uses non-conformity to attain his objectives-fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a college. Truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to. After viewing this junk you will see why. What a ridiculous name- South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the initials of this school of nonsense. Problem with these type of films is that in the end the non-conformist becomes the accepted mode. Let's step back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is- excessive manipulative junk! ,negative
 What a silly movie. While it looks nice it doesn't make a lot of sense. On the one hand the film suggests that Juana's madness was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand she has an obsession that is right out of the worst Victorian novel of the wronged woman and that does seem a sort of mental problem like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth had not been able to get past Essex's sexual attraction. ,negative
 Not one of Monogram's better(not trying to be amusing here either)Chan entries. The Shanghai Cobra has a lot going for it but in the end is just way too confusing and cluttered to be overly satisfying. The film opens with a murderer named the Shanghai Cobra having already struck twice and now is about in a scene at a diner in some way. We have a guy a girl and another guy having some implied connection when one guy dies in the streets. Yes I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation. I haven't even gone into the diner cook who has some involvement and a juke box that talks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't seem to have a problem with that! All this is in the first five minutes or so. Then Chan enters film working for the government and flying out to help a friend. He also has right to check a bank's store of radium and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages that he helped arrest in Shanghai many years earlier. I found the plot very involved as stated earlier. Toler is back as Chan. He is ever affable. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are back too. Both do good jobs and are quite amusing. But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance. This isn't a bad movie not just a very interesting one except for the most devoted of Chan fans. ,negative
 This was a film based on the Novel written by the modern literary god that is Koontz? I refuse to believe that studio bought the rights to this movie for anything using the Genius' Koontz name. Ever since my sight became poor enough to require Large Print I have been unable to read this book as I had at least twice a year since first reading it. I missed the book greatly and was unable to find it in Large Print. I was hoping by renting this movie I would at least get my vicarious Watcher's pleasures but this movie was a travesty. Because of subtle plot points it is my belief none of Mr. Koontz's or most decent authors for that matter books can be crammed into 1-2 hours of film. It will be the wise network cable or other wise who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multiple part television movie i.e. mini series of this book the RIGHT way! one a star out of five - would that I could go lower ... ,negative
 Egads. I used to think Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I not so sure anymore Willy gives Keannu some stiff competition with his I'm made of plaster performance in this movie. Combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot and not a single likable character and it's pretty hard to recommend this turkey. Natasha tries her best but even Julia Roberts couldn't save this flick from obscurity. Avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else on. -Oh heck in that case just read a book. ,negative
 (Chances are I'm gonna spoil Valuable Plot Points while writing this and because I can't determine and don't really care what YOU think is a Valuable Plot Point then if you are thinking of watching this film and have an issue with learning such things then I suggest you hop right on to the next review.) You know I don't mind the cult films being filed under the cult section. And people who believe it can go there and get their fill of the reality . I mean is it too much to ask that the overtly pseudo-Christian propaganda films be filed with the other Special Interest movies? I couldn't have been more flabbergasted had Pat Robertson made a porn movie. (or would that be flubbergasted ?) It was bad enough that there was an egregiously insufficient count of kicking and punching in this. It was bad enough that the same story has been done repeatedly in much better ways. It was bad enough that it wasn't filed under Special Interest with other cult films. It was bad enough that it somehow is receiving nods for being realistic as if we live in the world where towns get possessed by the debbil and the really profound and nasty evil ISN'T done by human beings -- usually in the NAME of religions based on the god of Abraham. It was bad enough having to simply shut the thing down because people were complaining so loudly that it was awful. No the really BAD part was when one of our guests stood up after we finally had to just turn the damn thing off and declared I for one would like to see something really violent or pornographic now just to get that OUT of my head. Preferably both if you have it. And we had just MET her. ,negative
 I'll start by admitting that I enjoy many movies that have low ratings on this site. I find that if I can see what the creators were trying to do I can find appreciation for their work. Sound of Thunder was a story that interested me. I wanted to see what angles the filmmakers would attack in telling the story. By and large they attempted to create an entertaining movie. The plot was contrived but most action movie's plots are. Ed Burns doesn't know how to carry a rifle but still holds his own well as an action lead considering he isn't asked for much. The main problem !destroys the whole movie! is the horrible CGI. It is totally unacceptable for the animals and backgrounds to look soooooo very fake. Aside from that the animal conceptions could have been really good as could the action scenes but failed because the production failed. This could have been a really memorable film if they had only finished it. It really looks like they meant to go back and fix all the horrible CGI but ran out of money and still released it. Save your money because someone failed this movie. I give it three stars because it really could have been good but was totally failed somewhere I can't say it enough. ,negative
 If one wants to have a character in a movie have a disturbing sexual encounter that would shame that character in later life the only thing left that an audience would see as shameful was bestiality and now it has been done. Judging by some of the other comments even that did not succeed that well. I cannot remember one funny scene though I have to admit I had to turn it off before it was finished. I did watch a part of the director's commentary and it appears he was as surprised as anyone that the movie was doing well. If you want to get the same feeling you get from this movie but only cheaper stick your head in a pile of manure and breath deeply. ,negative
 Though it pains me to some degree that I'm bothering to christen the comments board for this new series - mainly because I'd hate to give the false impression that there's actually any semblance of public interest in it - I feel compelled to throw in my chips on this one. To put it simply never before have I felt so persuaded to root for a TV show's swift and merciless cancellation based solely on the merit of its promo ads. And in case you're wondering I'm a dude. Listen Comedy Network: though your existing original programming is already shall we politely say of a 'questionable' quality (I'm looking at you Girls Will Be Girls ) you have truly outdone yourselves on this one. Whoever green-lit this thing could not be further out of touch with what's cool right now. Best of luck. ,negative
 Why oh why did they have to try and make a sequel to one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time. The movie is a train wreck on every level and should have never been made. Randy Quaid's portrayal of cousin Eddie is an over the top caricature of his previous outings as cousin Eddie. Also the Eddie character is not interesting enough to carry an entire movie. Even eye candy Sung Hi Lee could not redeem this hunk of holiday crap. Please do not waste your time on this move just watch the original again. ,negative
 This movie should go down in the annals of fiefdom as one of the worst of all time. I will stop short of saying it's the worst movie ever only because I have yet to see every movie ever made. I cannot make such lofty claims until then. The story is stale the acting is horrible at best the special effects are no more than a couple of lbs. of dry ice and a fan. Somebody must have been related to someone to get this movie made. Mr. Busey mailed this one in! The dog is well trained and cute making it the only redeeming quality in this never-should-have-made-it movie. Two hours and $3 of my life I will never get back. ,negative
 With the Terrible acting the awful dialog the multitude of bad humor the crappy plot and over terrible film. This has to be the worst film i have ever viewed in my life and i'm the king of finding bad movies. For the effects they just threw fake blood on people and things didn't spend the time to create wounds and make special effects worth anything. Most people making low budget horror flicks at least do something like clads of tissue or something to make a gashing wound. The dialog was far from even decent and the acting was without direction or effort. They just threw some actors on a set and said have at it. I swear i've seen better films from my film I class at school. How did this ever get a DVD release? ,negative
 Wow another Kevin Costner hero movie. Postman Tin Cup Waterworld Bodyguard Wyatt Earp Robin Hood even that baseball movie. Seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the heroics the flaws the greatness the fall the redemption. Yup within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie we're all supposed to be in awe of his character and it builds up more and more from there. And this time the story ... story? ... is just a collage of different movies. You don't need a spoiler; you've seen this movie several times though it had different titles. You'll know what will happen way before it happens. This is like mixing An Officer and a Gentleman with Backdraft but both are easily better movies. Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made ... and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor Russell plays the hero. ,negative
 Seeing that this got a theatrical release nowhere around the globe it only serves as a reminder of were the careers of those talent-free ladies Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich went. It also is a particular grating kind of movie the kind that think they are smart funny and original while being poor in every aspect. Full blame can go to Brian Burns who wrote and directed this potboiler. His script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it. The situations develop completely without any inner logic besides that of a desperate scriptwriter. Characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts behave stupid and without any real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of Mrs. Richards. We don't believe her relationship with David Krumholtz's character for one minute and the way she is brought back into play after the one-hour mark is particularly pitiful. Why would anyone fall for a egocentric self-obsessed arrogant b**ch like this in the first place much less a second time? Especially after having supposedly found his..erm...true love? And if any of these things aren't enough to completely sink this movie than the central couple is. The coupling of Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than the Richards-one but it is to no avail. There is no chemistry no spark nothing that we might loosely accept as a credible couple. Worse these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating doing annoying and irritating things the viewer finally has no interest in whatsoever. Overall a very poor showing. Even die-hard rom-com fans might want to pass on this one as there are dozens of movie made with more skill or more charm. ,negative
 The films' producers are hoping that Cameron Diaz' name will help sell this picture. Unfortunately nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen. Despite some beautifully shot European locations and some solid production design elements the film fails mostly due to its awkward unbelievable romance between Brewster and Eccleston. An unplesasant filmgoing experience. ,negative
 Mario Racocevic from Europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film.Yet again another difficult film to purchase in the UK.I had to go through Midnight Video who have a Swedish branch.I went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only SKR30 a title. This film goes under many a.k.a's depending on when and where it is marketed.I had previously purchased The Bloodsucker leads the Dance (which you will find if you search on Imdb under people and input Krista Nell ).The actor who plays the Count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from Italian into English by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice.I smiled when I heard this same voice dubbing on the English soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the copse in the subject film.My choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious Krista Nell. There are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail/extortion sleazy affairs with girlfriends' mothers a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit a gangrape by a client's motorcycle friends sleazy photography cross dressing by transvestites etc. which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word - SLEAZE (but artistic sleaze).The aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other Imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their wheres and whyfores .Personally I thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters.Also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long having made their point so that the film appeared to drag in places; e.g. the scene of the dancing transvestite.Krista Nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and I was left wanting more from her the director and the screenplay. I love the political incorrectness shown in older films (this is 30 years from its making) e.g. smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office!I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and I have awarded it as such. ,negative
 Possibly one of the best most horrible b movies ever as in it's so bad and random it's kinda hilarious and i don't know how to feel about it..reminds me of Cabin Fever..there's just something about that kid jumping off the porch doing karate and yelling 'pancakes' that's intriguing. Since a lot of people have already outlined the plot and everything all i'm going to do is sum up the quality of the movie with one quote: I'm the park ranger who's going to f*ck you up . yeah enough said?. If you're looking for quality or a really scary movie i don't recommend it. but if you like these sorts of films then I guess you would enjoy it..I don't know how but I guess some people would. ,negative
 Let me preface by stating that I have lived in Louisville Kentucky all of my life. I grew up about ½ mile from Waverly. In the wintertime we would pull our sleds down Maryman road and cross Dixie Highway to go sleigh riding on Waverly Hill. Many times during the winter of 76-77 we would climb into the Tunnel to warm ourselves. The place was still being run as a Geriatric Center at the time. We would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to bang on what we thought was the Door to the Morgue . I have to be honest. The only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we should not be doing. I would have to say we went up that tunnel over 50 times that winter. Nothing stranger than teen-aged boys acting stupid ever happened. I love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years. One evening when I was young we looked out our front porch and it appeared that the entire hill was on fire. There was an older hospital on the hill that burned down. It burned for hours while the entire neighborhood sat outside and watched. The thing that gets lost about Waverly is that many people survived TB there. Let's face itThe doctors back then did everything they thought was correct to save people. It took a lot of guts for people to work there knowing how contagious TB was. Too much is focused on those who suffered. I also have traveled into the building several times in the early 70's. We would go and visit shut-ins in the Nursing Home through a church youth group. By the way the doors there were not prison like steel doors with chains and padlocks as portrayed in the film. They were wooden and opensometimes too open. It did smell of urine and feces and you saw the occasional open gown associated with patients with dementia. It was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's. A lot of that may have to do with the age of the building or the right guy wasn't paid off. This is after all Kentucky. The part of the documentary that turned me off the most was the piling of bodies into a cart. If I am not mistaken it appears to have been Holocaust footage. That was added for dramatic effect. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker. I am a skeptic when it comes to Ghosts . I do believe that many around here truly think the place to be haunted. Waverly for me however symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled. ,negative
 This movie was so awful so boring so badly miscast -- it took a lot of work to make what should have been a sure thing into such a travesty. I love Lucille Ball but she absolutely stunk in this movie. Too old couldn't sing sounded like a truck dumping gravel even when NOT singing -- and the biggest sin of all -- SHE WASN'T FUNNY. EVEN A LITTLE. The studio shot themselves in the foot with this one and for ruining what should have been a fabulous screen version of a fabulous stage musical some other body parts deserve to have been wounded as well -- or perhaps they were already lacking those parts. That might explain it. But for Lucy to think she was right for a part that required SINGING -- well that's the saddest thing of all. It's a very good thing to know your limitations. Even a legend can't come out of a stinker like this and still smell like a rose. ,negative
 Silly comedy casts an embarrassed-seeming Ray Milland as a British officer in World War II Europe escaping German confines and taking up with a man-hungry gypsy woman played by Marlene Dietrich. Slowly-paced overlong and miscast: the leads are far too old for this type of juvenile fodder although Marlene shines in her solo moments. It took three scriptwriters to adapt Yolanda Foldes' book for the screen but this material must have already seemed dated by 1947--it smacks of something Ernst Lubitsch might have turned out in 1939. The scenario is musty and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together. ** from **** ,negative
 In 1984 The Karate Kid had some charm to it even if it was little more than a poor man's Rocky. Alas producer Jerry Weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the definitive low in the franchise yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential. What other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? Wait a minute. Next? Yep Macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually) and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!) playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named Julie Pierce. Now the girl has family issues. She also gets in trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out though one of his students is actually a nice guy and Julie falls for him. This gets her in bigger trouble than before of course. Lucky for her she is currently living with Mr. Miyagi (Morita) an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys. All those factors ad up to seven clichés and that's just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! From beginning to end The Next Karate Kid is a tired flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. Swank does thankfully have the likes of Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this disaster but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first movie and was quite enjoyable in the sequels but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the wax on wax off gag is stillborn. As for Ironside he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III but that's hardly a stretch. So is this picture really that awful? Not exactly. There is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of Asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest. ,negative
 As a sci-fi and casual Angelina Jolie fan I thought this obviously low-budget movie might be worth a look... maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults. Plus it might be interesting to watch Angelina as she was embarking on her star-bound career. Oh how wrong I was. One thing I learned -- at 18 Angelina Jolie couldn't act. So to make her comfortable the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldn't act. Seeing this Jack Palance (who can actually act) decided to overact. Watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes out. To the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script insipid dialog bottom-of-the-barrel cinematography... in fact add bottom-of-the-barrel everything. The story features Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin. She escapes the corporate HQ with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid stuff happens. The end. I would tell you more but I didn't want to waste my life watching this dreck. I implore you -- this is not worth watching. Its not even worth thinking about watching. Save yourself the pain and move on. ,negative
 Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke. He might as well have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. Kay Hoog reminds one more than a little of both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow quintessential man of mystery- and the very first Dark Knight - was also thought to be one Kent Allard. If one were to take Savage's first name first and add to it the Kent you end up with- voila- Clark Kent. Funny innit?) Like Indiana Jones Hoog isn't above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his thefts are often more blatant and less charmingly roguish than Jones's). Unfortunately this two-parter is a far cry from subsequent serials (from any era) in terms of overall quality. One of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback quite literally breathing down his neck simply watch as Hoog escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon. Why they don't bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie-making mysteries that plague these two films. The second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first. Granted this was one of the first ever serials and as such should be cut a bit of slack- but there are limits even to tolerance. (At one point the capture of the hero is effected not on screen but in the narration itself! Talk about cutting corners...) Fritz Lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did THE SPIDERS is a bitter pill indeed to swallow... ,negative
 Bad editing bad production values bad continuity implausible bad dialogue... this movies is bad bad bad. However if you want a movie to poke fun at (a la MST3000) this is your movie. I wouldn't suggest spending much money on it but if you do see this movie make sure it's with plenty of witty like-minded buddies. ,negative
 I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made Christian film about The End Times (which I find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair I only saw the last 30 minutes so I missed the part about UFOs and the Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the Christian faith as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense. As a film the script was terrible the acting was mediocre and the pacing was poor. The cinematography and direction were sub-par: no interesting visuals no layered plot line no creativity. Don't just blame it on the budget- films can still be interesting without special effects. This wasn't. Christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic sphere just because of their message. And the message here was hardly Christian. **Disclaimer: The rest of this comment is targeted towards Christians** First off it is unethical in any business to bait-and-switch your customers. I don't like being told I can win a free iPod only to realize I have to spend $300 at participating stores first. Nonchristians don't like being told they're watching a Sci-Fi film and then get bombarded with Christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Hidden agendas don't win you any friends much less converts. Secondly you should not use overt threats to convince people your beliefs are true. The actors who represented Christians came off as callous smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical unbeliever -- they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing. Representational dialogue: Turn to Jesus- OR GO TO HELL! Fine don't believe me- BUT YOU'LL BE SORRY! The day you die I can guarantee you'll wish you paid more attention to this Jesus stuff- WHEN YOU LAND IN THE BELLY OF HELL! OK I may be exaggerating but it certainly came off in the same manner. If you think this is a clear message for Christ you're wrong. I don't recall Jesus using threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear. So Christians please don't use this as a witnessing tool for your unsaved friends. It is heavy-handed offensive and inaccurate in portraying a true Christian message. Thirdly the theology was bad. Apart from characterizing Jesus as a means of hell-insurance it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn't attempt to engage the issue of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. Instead it offered one pat answer: UFOs are the devil's scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens which is neither biblical nor widely-accepted by most Christians. As the Bible doesn't mention UFOs or aliens you can't use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other. The rapture isn't necessarily even a widely-accepted sound biblical concept though nowadays most evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series. If you do your research (as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting) the idea of two comings of Christ (the first as the rapture) is a relatively new phenomena in Church tradition popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the 20th century. The majority of orthodox Christians will probably find this film's message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported presuppositions. Basically this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I wouldn't recommend it. ,negative
 I don't normally write reviews but this film was special. I couldn't turn it off. I don't believe I've ever seen a worse movie but there I sat watching. It was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway. It was disgusting but I couldn't turn away. Where do I start? The movie seems to think it's a sports thriller but it's so utterly ridiculous it can only be a comedy but it's not funny not even in a dumb/silly way. It's like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get-togethers. It's painful to watch but at least it's only for a minute or two. Second String went on for over an hour. Whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again. The writing directing acting and everything was just terrible. The problem is I can't describe how bad it was; you just had to see it. And I'm sure this will NEVER be shown again so unless you saw it you're out of luck. I mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other bad film I've seen over my lifetime. And for every film I see in the future that I can't stand I will think to myself well at least it wasn't bad as the Second String. ,negative
 The movie is being televised as I write. I simply forgot how horrible an experience I had watching it in the cinema. The whole idea of the movie is flawed. The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans stranded in the desert forget all concept of morals and civilization within a couple of days is laughable. The madness of Lord of the flies was longer in the making. Details that annoy are plenty. One is the single African god-like character that mysteriously survives the horrible climate and have done so for ages without losing his mind and he seems to have no supply-problems either. Ridiculous. So too is the rescue attempt from the tour guide an Indiana Jones look-alike whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death a 5 minute walk from the hut. Then there's the choice of Lear imposed onto the group by a guru-like joke of an artist. He reminded me of my hippie high school art teacher. The worst thing though is Levrings choice of Lear. Obviously is an intellectual brain-fart. How that ever was going to be an pass-time is never clear to me. Positives are few and far between. It's a beautiful movie but that's never important. High school intellectualism. Weird for the sake of weird. It's a complete waste of time unless you like thrashing useless art movies. ,negative
 To sum it all up skip End of Days and watch rent Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate instead. This movie is the perfect stereotypical American movie vs Ninth Gate being the perfect stereotypical European movie. Ninth Gate: Noir-ish intelligent nicely scored atmospheric excellent acting (Johnny Depp esp) beautiful scenery good cinematography funny one-liners intellectual minimal foul language thought-provoking. The only fault is it that a few people didn't understand the open-ended ending and said the movie was crappy because of that and there were a couple of questionable scenes. End of Days: Overly violent liberal use of foul language NO musical score except for a poor attempt at a commercial soundtrack that was only heard when Gabriel Byrne stalked around NYC as Satan (but all you could pick out was Korn's Jonathan Davis unintelligible screaming) sex that had nothing to do with the plot violence incredibly predictable violence and did I mention lots more violence? I guess some of the special effects were good but that's about it. Well maybe I'm wrong but I thought Ninth Gate was far more interesting quirky original and intelligent. But maybe Americans don't need need that. *dripping with cynicism* Even though I am an American sometimes I wonder. ,negative
 The best part in this movie is the first one located in Sicily I suppose. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising. The rest of the story is quite boring. Crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique Fellinian surrealistic remembrances and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short. Frankly this is a real overrated movie and Crialese is a real overrated director. ,negative
 I attended the premier last night. The movie started out with a bang (perhaps due to pre-premier excitement). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep. This movie can not be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any of Guest's work unless you want to say _Sons of Provo_ is a wanna-be gone awfully wrong. It just fell flat it died it was painful. The story went nowhere the jokes were bland even if you were a Mormon and could get all of the inside jokes it felt like a waste of time. There were two redeeming qualities: Kirby's acting was spot on! And the songs were very clever (for an LDS audience only). So my recommendations... Avoid the movie. And if you are Mormon buy the music CD. ,negative
 The very first time I saw this I recoiled in HORROR at what was being presented as modern liberated women. Sorry but I cannot relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around loveless sex and the acquisition of Gucci Prada and Louis Vuitton labels. The troubling thing is that some may actually think this is how career women live in NYC. It's definitely not. These women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and as another reviewer said they act like gold-digging hooches. This is not liberated womanhood and I'm glad it's gone. 0 stars and just plain AWFUL ,negative
 Friday Night With Jonathan Ross must have those in charge of Ross rubbing their sweaty little palms together. They know the BBC lacks imagination when it comes to talk shows so when they have Jonathan Ross at their disposal they are quite settled to just sit back and let a half wit command this primetime slot. Ross Spends most of the show grooming his ego and smiling about how much the BBC is paying him. The show is a complete copy of many US Chat Shows - Leno Letterman Conan O Brian the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses can also be done for the dumb masses in the UK also. The unfortunate situation - he has no competition? Parkinson has gone by the reality is he was never really up to much except grooming a celebs ego. Can't we have someone funnier and slicker on British Screens instead of Jonathan Ross? Once Ross has built up his ego enough he will then proceed to the very boring concept of the stiff celebrities in the green room - so trying to get on with each other. If an A-Lister is present (which is so often the case these days - as there are no other chat shows they can turn to - to promote their latest movie) - he will spend the next hour either flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in the Universe. Sqeamish when he had Ringo Starr on - a man that cares nothing for licking arse - Ross genuinely was begging for his mobile phone number (as common policy on this show is for Jonathan Ross to get everyones number so he can be seen in the right company when not working). Of course Ringo said it how it is - and simply said no I don't like you - dead pan serious. Ross needs to be axed from all Awards and TV shows - the masses will get over it. ,negative
 Okay it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke (when the dead are rising from their tombs the names of the old time horror directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are featured in the tombstones) and the smashing of morally bankrupt Repu/con/rightist villains is on-target: whorish skanks preaching morals etc. But why these soldiers are anti-Republicans? Because they have gone to the war most of them should be Republicans right? Why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something? Why they ALL want to vote against the Republicans? Why this story has made of a movie? Questions never answered... ,negative
 Maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it's still a way to make a living. However after watching this movie one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy bloated conceited paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break. Not exactly a pretty picture but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious noisy overacted action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these movies has Hollywood made? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. The locales change but the plots remain the same and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to run-on interminably. When will this movie end? I repeatedly thought to myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally unbelievable as a CIA operative but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting an overweight Russell Crowe plays a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this movie the on site operative is lean and mean while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. This is called stereotyping. What was the casting director thinking? Why not have Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? Or Nicole Kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) trying to pass himself off as an Arab ... speaking fluent Arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real Arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable Arab masquerade ... trying to romance a Palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. By now you get the point. Next time try casting an actual Arab in the role. Not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that. There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. In this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. Next stop for this movie - DVD land and oblivion. And one other thing. Don;t let this movie discourage you from working for the government. The pay may not be great but the fringe benefits are excellent a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits. ,negative
 Surprisingly Kieslowski's this movie is disappointing to me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes cliché script that also seems a work of a poor observation sometimes. There is an isolated young boy. He lives with one of his relatives but he is lonely and every night watches a woman who lives across their building. It seems! that he wants her. He is one of the youths who are not good at communication with the opposite sex. However he likes that woman when the woman comes to his house with a man Tomek gets pain. Then we understand that Kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a female to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. He does not do something else because may be he knows that it is his salvation. One day he stops that woman suddenly he seems a shy boy but proves that he is not so he explains her almost everything. She lectures and refuses him. Everything is so realistic like the other Kieslowski films no problem. The problems start when Tomek visits her the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but an unrequited love) turns into the story of a lonely young boy falls in love with a mature woman at the beginnings the woman refuses but after a short time she starts to change her mind. This U-Turn makes the movie cliché firstly. The personality of Tomek is weird? or a result of a poor observation? I disappointed with this character this is my opinion and I will try to tell why. When he goes to her house Magda treats him very friendly. She asks what do you want from me? To kiss me? to make love with me? to go out with me? At this point I remember the people who say she is a femme fatale. See? Returning to the scene Tomek rejects all the proposals. Why? Because he is shy? I don't think so but his communication is blunt OK. After the leg scene at home some events make the movie misses its aim. I think that the aim of the movie is (should have been according to the story) to show us there are some people who suffer from lack of endearment and to save from this situation is not easy owing to lack of communication and being aloof especially for men. I mean that at this point what does the movie say? It is blurred and disappointing. It is seen that he is not hunger for love or a female or sex. Then what? And the suicide attempt scene support this weakness. So that he touches her legs he wants to kill himself! By the way as I mentioned before some say Magda is a femme fatale. Totally not. She endeavors in order to make Tomek happy. Does she avoid having contact with him? No. Does she insult him? No. Does she amuse him? No. And Does she deceive him? No. She has some troubles with her (ex) lover so she is not O.K. However she does not take revenge for it from Tomek. She is not an angel but not a femme fatale also. ,negative
 No shortage of female flesh but still not interesting! Lenzi at least is capable of so far greater probably peaking at Spasmo and starting with Kiss Me Kill Me The Hard Gore R2 DVD release may be cut at 86 minutes but this movie contains one act of cannibalism and one victim - a scene with a native girl who is brutalised and disembowelled by the cannibal tribe we are warned of and who later set fire to some huts. Arsonist Holocaust? Firestarter Fernox anyone? Certainly not a cannibal flick but was there ever a decent one made? Avoid. ,negative
 Afraid of the Dark left me with the impression that several different screenplays were written all too short for a feature length film then spliced together clumsily into this Frankenstein's monster. At his best the protagonist Lucas is creepy. As hard as it is to draw a bead on the secondary characters they're far more sympathetic. Afraid of the Dark could have achieved mediocrity had it taken just one approach and seen it through -- and had it made Lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of ghoulish and off-putting. I wanted to see him packed off into an asylum so the rest of the characters could have a normal life. ,negative
 Ok let's start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad it's REALLY BAD. Rarely something with a little bit of quality comes along(Lek Karakter) here in holland but not often. Costa! is about 4 girls going to Spain to go on vacation party get drunk get laid (u know the drill). It's also about the world of Clubbers or Proppers. Pro's who're trying to lure the crowd into their club. I'm not sure how long it took to write the script but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you're watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long. Nothing and i mean nothing is believable in this movie. It's almost too riduculous for words what happens with the storyline. Suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing. With a one-on-one fight with 'the bad guy in black' and cliche car chase scenes trough a watertank-car (can it be more cheesy). Also the words character-development and casting are unfamiliar to the makers. After having seen Traffic 3 days before this i fell from sheer brilliance from a piece of art to this. This is film-making at it's saddest. And don't start about low budget. Because even with a low budget you could write a better script. It almost seems that the film-makers were too busy partying themselves to make a decent movie. Anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit but for the rest of it don't waste your money on such garbage. ,negative
 Yes I admire the independent spirit of it all but it's like Road Trip with a bad cast and no budget. I chuckle when I watch American comedies I don't laugh. This movie made me laugh but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high-budget American high school/pot-flicks. If you want good independent American comedy with pot-references go watch Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater flicks or something. Don't waste your time on this piece of sh't movie. I mean how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot! And by the way: in Norway it's called Dude Where's My Pot ! ,negative
 Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson making movies too long should sit through this CBS event . There's about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots featuring bland by-the-book TV drama clichés. Bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies so I'm not going to complain about that. Silly science can be fun to watch if it's executed in an amusing fashion. What kills this movie is it's 10 subplots... all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot. The one character that is entertaining to watch in Category 6 is Tornado Tommy despite being a very annoying stereotype. Note that I also didn't bother commenting on special effects. Their quality should come as no surprise. Not recommended. ,negative
 What starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent UNscary incompetently made stupid attempted horror films of recent years. Absolutely terrible. It's such a derivative mess ripping off every decent fright flick you can think of without successfully producing a single scare. Whether it's copying the recent trend with creepy kids or ghosts walking past the camera or the old school horror of Fulci's Gates of Hell. The worst thing is there's not even a cat jumping out of a cupboard to make you jump. To be avoided. ,negative
 I'd never thought that I would be caught saying this: But I think Dog the Bounty Hunter is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of High Octane cop shows such as CSI CSI: Miami and so forth. I'm not saying all these shows are bad but they aren't good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the CSI series. But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this. Stereotypes/Countertypes! That's right Stereotypes/Countertypes! Unfortunately this is a show for the moderates of Red State America who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. For example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into Dallas where he encounters group of kids in Goth/Punk clothing and they start harassing him. Now! This is exactly what Middle America perceives the Goth/Punk culture. I mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. Whenever there are Blacks and Latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. Okay! Not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty. Again this is what Middle Red State America sees of these people. Finally Why is the Trivette the bumbling sidekick can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker? ,negative
 Plankton or Creatures from the Abyss as I'm positive it's more commonly known as & filmed under as the title Creatures from the Abyss appears over a moving image & in the same font type as the rest of the credits starts with five 20 something kids Mike (Clay Rogers) his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey) sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) & Dorothy (Loren DePalm) & an annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon) whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat & head out to sea don't ask why as I don't know. Oh & the complete idiot Bobby left the petrol behind & never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor & to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm & discover a dead body floating in the water. Shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht & potential safety in a flash everyone boards the yacht & begin to explore. First of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens & computer equipment then down below they find fully furnished & luxurious cabins. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who appears mad & can't talk. They eat fish from the fridge which makes Dorothy puke up green vomit beetles & slugs. They learn that these fish are living fossil's 1000's of years old & have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea & that they fly mutate bite & are generally unpleasant to be around. I really can't be bothered to go on with this plot outline so I won't here's what I think... This Italian production was produced & directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri (I'd hide under a different name if I made a film this bad too) & I think Plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever there are so many things wrong with this film it's difficult to know where to start. First the script by Richard Baumann is total crap it makes no sense whatsoever & is so slow & dull it was torture for me to sit through. Why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in? What were they planning on doing exactly? Why do we often get point-of-view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character & how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in? People's actions & reactions to things are all wrong they constantly split up they make bizarre decisions that simply don't make any sense in the situation they find themselves in & some of the dialogue is as awful as anything I've heard. I could go on all day about all the plot holes & ridiculous goings on but I'll run out of space if I do. The fish creatures themselves look awful a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets & some really bad stop motion animation at the end the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super imposition. I have heard a lot of comments saying that Plankton is gory don't make me laugh! Forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in Plankton whatsoever there are a couple of slimy scenes when Bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with Julie but it's pretty brief & he doesn't kill her he just sort of drips slime on her grows a couple of tentacles & a fish head comes out of his mouth. Later on Julie's vagina starts to drip some dark slime but that's it we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the slime is. Dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back off screen & control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while Margaret commits suicide a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead. Easily the grossest scene is when Dorothy pukes up that green stuff with what looks like beetles & slugs in it. That's it only one person actually dies on screen & for the most part Plankton is quite tame & as exciting as watching paint dry & I nearly fell asleep it's so boring. I can't see how anybody can like this total crap I just can't. The acting is awful the dubbing is awful the characters are awful & I hated all of them. Tecnically Plankton is predictably crap as well with an estimated budget of only $250 000 all I can say is where did the money go? The sets are monotonous & dull with one lab & a few cabins the special effect's are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever the cinematography is bland the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension & as a whole Plankton like it's name sake is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be. I hate Plankton it's awful in every single aspect of it's overlong 86 minute duration. Do yourself a favour & avoid this one at all costs unless your either a masochist or insomniac. ,negative
 I didn't really HATE Mirrormask. I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals. The movie begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away FROM the circus. During a heated argument with her mother Helana wishes she would drop dead. Bad move. The mother gets ill with...something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. On the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she finds herself . Personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming. The early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the bleakness of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block. But a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to CGI land where nearly everything is a computer image. The problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have. while films like the Wizard of Oz seemed enticing to explore Mirrormask shoves images in our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image. There's little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty (the librarian is a masterpiece) they just disappear so quickly that they're soon forgotten. Helana and her sidekick Valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst. Overall Mirrormask is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash. Stick to the real world kids. ,negative
 1 hour and 40 minutes of talking--boring talking and more talking and then some. It is hard for me to grasp how an actress like Anne Parillaud who shone superbly in Femme Fatale would sign up for such a piece of crap! Unbelievable. If you need a nightcap this movie might help although I would prefer some nice classical music. unfortunately i just found out that i have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear--that's almost as unbelievable! so short and succinct one or two sentence commentaries expressing one's core take on a movie is not enough. geez people. i made my point and don't to waste your time with more unnecessary words--as this movie does.

 John Waters owes me 2 hours of my life back. I saw a sneak-preview screening of this way back in 1990 and I'm still in pain. Not before or since have I seen such a terrible piece of filmic waste spewed upon the screen. There is nothing positive I can say about this film. Acting--awful; plot--ridiculous; music--atrocious. Following the movie my friends and I demanded our money back from the manager of the theater. He explained that since it was a free screening he couldn't give us anything in return no matter how much agony we were suffering through. How Johnny Depp's career survived this trainwreck of a movie is anyone's guess. ,negative
 God did I hate this movie! I saw it at a sneak preview 13 years ago and I STILL have bad flashbacks. It was without a doubt the WORST movie I ever paid to see. It was badly written badly directed and (surprisingly considering the cast) badly acted. I would rather be thrown off a rooftop onto razor sharp spikes and then have my skin peeled off than to sit through it again. Can you guess I didn't enjoy it? ,negative
 This was so bad I want God to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through it. First off the acting was uniformly bad. There was barely a plot unless Shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog counts. The editing was was all over the place and the slow-mo shots of the gore (red corn syrup flying through the air--doubtless flung using a spoon) got irritating after the tenth time and infuriating after the hundredth time. I like Michael Rooker. He's done some good work. This was not good. This was less than good. And by that I mean that it sucked. Hard. For god's sake don't watch this movie. ,negative
 I obtained this little piece of scuzz on the VideoAsia Tales of Voodoo DVD label. Quite where the voodoo is supposed to fit in I have no idea. Indeed I would not usually connect voodoo with Indonesia anyway (let alone with WIPs). I know and love WIP movies. I have seen most of them. I could not therefore resist this little known gem from the description given to it on the cover. It is APPALLING. You cannot have a WIP movie if the women keep their clothes on (even in the shower!). Although it gives a nod to the exploitation genre WIP without nudity is like a Big Mac without the beef. As my gym teacher used to say on the whole I'd rather be at the disco.... ,negative
 Cameron Diaz James Marsden Frank Langella: that's an all-star power cast but The Box proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie. The premise sounds promising: a couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollar. The downside is that someone will die a person they probably will not know. So What Do You Do ? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. After that the story derails completely. Vague an uninspired plot lines about an alien conspiracy involving the NASA nothing really is explained here. The Box is a disappointment could have been so much better. But since it is based on an ultra short story that explains the continuity errors. ,negative
 I don't believe I've seen a horror movie this bad since...hell I don't believe I've ever seen a horror movie this bad. The acting alone was enough to make one cringe. The bad acting went way beyond horror film cheesy. It was just plain awful. And did you check out those god awful special effects? When the demon (which looked more like a cheaply constructed puppet) came out of the wall I couldn't tell if I was supposed to be frightened or laughing my ass off. As a huge fan of the horror genre this film was more than mildly disappointing. I couldn't help but notice the director is from Portland OR which just happens to be my own hometown. I must say I'm deeply ashamed. If I could I'd give this film a negative 500. ,negative
 This movie is standard goofy sci-fi fare from the 50s. In its favor the plot does manage to pull off an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens themselves. But come on now if aliens needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs why would they come to earth? Why wouldn't they just suck it out of a STAR!?!? The only credible reason for the presence of Kronos is a direct attack on Earth society not the mere collection of energy. Nothing like that is even intimated; Kronos may have been built by a superior race but its activities on Earth are the most primitive. The end that the scientist-heroes plan for Kronos is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific gibberish. It amounts to the reverse the polarity gambit which has been used so much in bad scifi it has become a joke in itself. Low and behold this causes our unwanted visitor to release its collected energy. No one in power seems to care about the impact the release of that much energy (which by the film's end includes among other things the entire yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the surroundings. And unfortunately by the time the movie ends the surroundings are the suburbs of Los Angeles. Whoops! ,negative
 Hated it with all my being. Worst movie ever. Mentally- scarred. Help me. It was that bad.TRUST ME!!! ,negative
 This film fails on many many levels. The script is the first failing and as I understand it if the script stinks there's nothing that can fix that. The plot is boring after the first 45 minutes I'm looking at the counter on the DVD saying to myself how much longer? The cinematography is pretty awful. I'm not sure how bad the transfer was to DVD but it looked like a VHS copy. Also the sound was bad. I realize this isn't going to get remixed for 5.1 but yikes it didn't even sound like it was in Dolby Stereo which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this film. Slipstream was far too similar to both Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort. Because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog it is extremely disappointing. If I recall the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes usually it should take place in the first 20. Most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutes. The film's music was excellent in parts and then completely inappropriate in others. Elmer Bernstien did the scoring but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in 'other' stuff elsewhere as it doesn't match the overall good orchestral score (with some synthesizer music.) There were great actors cast Bob Peck Mark Hamill Ben Kingsley Bill Paxton. And they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters. (Well Paxton's character was pretty stupid and the whole movie was centered on him. I'm not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the film.) Again a major flaw with the script. Thank goodness I watched this from a mail order DVD service and not the theater. Overall a major disappointment for Sci-fi fans or fans of Paxton or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back. ,negative
 Wicked Little Things has an excellent synopsis: empty house beside abandoned mine in woods with tragic past; family moves into house and strange things begin to happen; little creepy children begin to pop up here and there doing creepy-little-children-things. But that is where the cleverness and potential fun ends. This group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier and now appear roving the woods (poor make-up) with weapons looking for flesh to eat. Oh I get it this is a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm....while I can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre this just didn't work. What was the children's motivation in seeking to devour flesh? Why did they need weapons? Did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage giggling because they felt this was going to be a cool/scary movie? I found that after thirty minutes I felt the familiar resignation that I had just wasted my time on another modern crap-fest. While the acting was good and the setting/cinematography of good quality as well the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether. A bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised rodents. This movie is not scary and while I can appreciate the story perhaps have even enjoyed it if I had read it instead of watched it I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is more accurately called Wicked Little Turd. ,negative
 I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie! It was unbelievable me and a group of friends decided to watch this one night and it was just the stupidest thing any of us had ever seen I couldn't believe it! We watched the first 15 minutes in utter awe that somebody actually thought of this and then made it into a movie. Are they on crack? My guess is yes in huge doses. I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash. Is this supposed to be sci-fi or comedy or what? I don't thing the idiots who made this even care they just decided to make a movie about nothing and see how many suckers they could trick into watching it. Well we put something on film so let's take it to the movie store and see if they actually put it on the shelf--no no no. This is not movie-making. The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is. I feel like going to the movie store and complaining and getting my money back nobody should have to endure this crap. So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE it is the dumbest thing you have never seen! ,negative
 Out of 15 people I loaned this movie too.. NO One finished it.. It was so Awfully.???????? Not good... Just awful. She sits in a chair the whole movie. She's in a Closet. The Chair she's sitting is nice. I can't think of anything more to say. But 10 lines of text. To print this up. My friend Nick thinks this is a great movie. because he can give it to his friends and not have to worry about THOSE calling him back. He's passed it around as a gag movie for 10 years. Which is how I got it.. Then.. I tried to get my friends to finish this extremity's awful awful piece of crap... To no aval.. no one could finish it.. Takes boredom to a whole new level. They could use this in Iraq INSTEAD OF WATER BOARDING... PLEASE SEND COPIES Guantanamo BAY CUBA. Makes great Xmas gift. ,negative
 A friend of mine decided to rent this thing lucky it wasn't my money.. Pretty much wasted my time though. A story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing/directing. Maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird over-acting :)(Gary Busey's character for example) All the over-acted characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a little interesting as they grabbed your attention (for all the wrong reasons obviously) where the movie in itself failed miserably. In short: A waste of time and money 2/10 ,negative
 I liked Half-Life. I am still it's fan. It was frightening intelligent and challenging. I don't tell any news it is one the best FPS ever made. Maybe I'm too hardcore Half-Life fan but the so called Half-Life 2 is not Half-Life 2. And I have a question: is THIS the next chapter of Half-Life? Maybe the creators -Valve- thinks so but I don't. Where are the intelligent enemies? Where is the frightening atmosphere? Nowhere. I believe they wanted to make a bit different Half-Life (instead of another research station story) but they didn't just made a very different one they made something that has to do with Half-Life like for example Quake does to Doom. The entire game so unsightly and unreal that it's almost forlorn. Though the physics are truly great and there were a few good level to play the idea to make a revolutionary physic-driven gameplay has utterly failed. When you get the Gravity-gun that can move objects you can expect with rights to use it as a weapon- that would turn the schematic FPS gameplay upside down. The truth is you can't use Gravity-gun as a real weapon. Why? Because the best you can do is throwing boxes and barrels that don't do much damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it can fall from about 3 shots. If you want to throw an exploding barrel to your enemy it can explode in your own hand . The gravity-gun doesn't work as a weapon. The best usage is solving some physic-puzzles. I ask Valve: Why? The truth is you must use your boring schematic FPS weapons to the end(except for last level) Weapons are not that made original Half-life a classic. If Gravity-gun would be always like at the last level -a real weapon- I'd admire what Valve did. But not this. This is disappointing. So if you want Half-Life then you are searching at the wrong place. Maybe you will enjoy it but I repeat: it is everything but not Half-Life and even not a faithful continuation of that. This is the greatest disappointment of all time. Valve have shown they can make awful games too. They have managed that. ,negative
 This movie is a shame especially considering Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur but professional director. However this movie fails to deliver anything you could expect. First of all -- I am Polish so I can tell all the background story because I read books. But how can you tell there is even a war from this movie -- bunch of people are going back and forth some soldiers are shouting... This is really The Second World War or soldiers are on vacations? Acting and dialogs -- poor miserably poor. A.Żmijewski D.Stenka M.Komorowska W.Kowalski A.Chyra fit in their roles the rest of (Polish) cast is out of the place (most notably M.Ostaszewska one of the leading characters what an unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogs are not spoken they are just put there actors had difficulties to perform and it is no surprise considering what odd things they had to say. And this leads us to the most disappointing issue -- you can't feel it. Everything is so theatrical artificial. There is no real life there is no feeling in it. There are a lot of original footage from the WWII and guess what the material is much more powerful dramatic than what A.Wajda did. I can see only one positive -- despite historical mistakes (like acronym ZSRR; it was made for post-1945 propaganda purposes to please Polish that ZSRS was gone and now there was ZSRR but in 1940 there was no ZSRR!) luckily it is undoubtedly shown killing in Katyn was done by Soviets (yes it is a fact not some controversial gossip). Great two hours for 5-10 minutes scene. Anyway -- time and potential wasted. This is tragedy of epic proportions will to fight in 1939 (barely shown) not declaring war against Soviet Union by Polish authorities (sic! not shown here) imprisonment of soldiers shortly after living in the outrageous conditions (not shown here) hope and fear what will come next (barely shown) and then... extermination. Hand to hand with Germans -- Soviets were exterminating Polish nation aimed at people who constituted the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately they succeed and the results are still visible to this very day. ,negative
 What annoys me with so called 'science' programs such as these is that it is presented as if it were a FACT that dinosaurs live 'millions' of years ago. Firstly nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions/billions of years old. It's a shallow theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot. Secondly nobody can prove that evolution ever happened. All Darwin's missing links are still MISSING ! If you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth they are complete animals of a certain kind eg: a dog or a cat. Nobody has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or in the example presented in this series a dinosaur turning into a bird. This is utter hogwash. There's more proof that Santa Claus exists than any animal changing into another kind of animal. All the ideas presented in this series is an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and the everything in it was created. This series is NOT SCIENCE. It is a religious world view that hides under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you are seeing here is SCIENCE FICTION. If you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that it's a science fiction program then rather watch Star Trek or Star Wars. ,negative
 A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. I knew the movie was going downhill when I saw the fake campfire flikering lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence. The acting wasn't as bad as the typical B movie and there was some believability in their fear but as professional cavers they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession. Overall not worth wasting $4.50 to rent. ,negative
 This is one cheap looking movie! A stripper keeps getting attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her. She goes to the police who also rape her. She finally finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies and they trace the zombies back to 'The Zombie Master'. The fact that Stephanie Beaton stars as the stripper is the only reason to watch this film. ,negative
 I lay the blame for The Comebacks on anyone who enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie. You people encouraged the Fox studio to keep on churning out desperate parody films and now we're faced with what just may be the laziest and most desperate one of them all. The Comebacks barely qualifies as a parody. Heck it barely qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory but not in execution. No one not even the people involved with this mess could have possibly fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) has made something truly wretched here. The plot if you can even call it that centers on a man named Lambeau Fields (David Koechner). Right when I heard his name within the first couple seconds of the film I knew I was in for a long movie. Funny names are seldom funny and become even less funny the more you hear them. Lambeau is one of the worst coaches in the world but he's been given another chance by his best friend Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers) to coach a ragtag high school football team called The Comebacks. Lambeau must not only lead the team to victory but also teach them the ways of inspirational sports movie clichés. He expects his kids to have poor grades and problems with alcohol and ridicules them when they don't. When it looks like the team has a chance to play at the big championship Toilet Bowl game (Did 10-year-olds write this script?) Lambeau is shocked to discover that Freddie is the coach of the big rival team that his team will be playing against. Turns out Freddie only encouraged Lambeau to take the coaching job because he wanted The Comebacks to lose. The Comebacks is a movie so forced and pathetic I almost had a hard time believing what I was watching. Spoof movies have recently turned into a game of spot the movie reference and this continues the tradition. It tries to squeeze in as many references to other sports movies as it can but it either does absolutely nothing with them expecting us to just point at the screen and laugh out of familiarity or it attempts to be funny and falls flat on its face. Some of the films referenced include Field of Dreams Bend it Like Beckham Rocky Balboa Friday Night Lights Stick It Radio Miracle Remember the Titans Gridiron Gang Invincible and Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. But wait wasn't Dodgeball already a parody of inspirational sports movies? So in other words we're watching a parody of a parody of inspirational sports movies. If that makes any sense to you you're just the audience this movie is looking for. Some of these films are referenced in the plot and some (like the Rocky one) are just thrown in for no reason because the filmmakers wanted to try to reference as many films as possible. There are some that the movie even feels the need to explain to us in its dialogue just in case we've missed the obvious reference. You know a movie is in trouble when it has to spell out its own jokes to us. The worst thing is that the screenplay by TV veterans and first time screen writers Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez doesn't even know the first and most important rule of parody - You have to play it straight. The actors have to pretend they're not in on the joke. The reason why the classic Zucker Brothers movies like Airplane Top Secret and The Naked Gun are remembered so fondly is because they cast serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes he was a serious actor before he turned to comedy) and Robert Stack and then threw them into ridiculous situations. What made it funny is that they acted like they weren't in a comedy and kept a stone face to the weirdness around them. Those films wouldn't have worked if they played their roles broadly. The Comebacks proves this as all the actors are forced to play their roles so goofy it's like they're screaming at us to laugh. David Koechner keeps on flailing his arms bulging his eyes and screaming at the top of his lungs to the point he looks like someone who knows he's trapped in a dead-end comedy and just tries too hard to pretend he's having a good time. The movie also doesn't understand the art of celebrity cameos (also an important factor when it comes to parody films). What kind of cameos do we get in The Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. By the time the movie throws in an out of nowhere and extremely pointless cast musical number to Journey's Don't Stop Believing for absolutely no reason whatsoever I was just about ready to walk out the theater door. I was the only person at my screening and the thought of this movie going on its pathetic way to a completely empty house kind of appealed to me. I did sit through the rest of The Comebacks and I was not rewarded for my efforts. The sad thing is Fox is not yet done killing the spoof genre. They have a parody of 300 coming out next year called Meet the Spartans. I'd say it can't be much worse than this but I've seen the trailer and I wouldn't want to get your hopes up. ,negative
 It is a story as old as man. The jealousy for another man's wife and possessions. There are even commandments against it. In this story Raymond Burr ( Perry Mason Ironside ) is the manager of a runner plantation who lusts after the owners wife and feels that he isn't treated with respect. The wife the starlet Barbara Payton who was trying to make a comeback after a string of sordid affairs was lusting after Burr who killed her husband Paul Cavanagh. But lurking about was a strange woman the housekeeper (Gisela Werbisek) who sees everything and who was capable of some voodoo to avenge the wronged which also included another young woman (Carol Varga) to whom Burr also professed love. Burr is poisoned and becomes or thinks he becomes a gorilla. Payton will have to mate with Kong if she ever wants her marriage consummated as he goes into the jungle every night. The end is predictable. But the stirring question of this film is why Payton would ever be afraid. With those sharply pointed missiles jutting out from her chest no animal could get near her to do harm. ,negative
 When I first became a father about 5.5 years ago I was prepared for many of the sacrifices I'd have to make. I knew I'd have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing Santa Claus parade but I wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice I made last night. This in my humble opinion is cruel and unusual punishment. Underdog is bad. It's not quite Karate Dog bad but it makes The Shaggy Dog feel like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog were a television show I'd recommend flipping on by. Not even the presence of Puddy and the voice of Banky Edwards can save it. Bow. Wow. It was also just about the best 80 minutes I've ever enjoyed. James was seated to the right of me and Michelle to the left and I spent more time watching their reaction to this talking flying mutt than watching the screen. At 5 and 3 years old they were the target audience and this movie nailed the target. There's a scene where Underdog belches loudly in another dogs face and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film. When Underdog was flying into outer space James was literally at the edge of his seat mesmerized. The kids absolutely loved Underdog and that's why I was there. That's what last night was all about. Unless you're accompanying someone under the age of ten you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film. But if you are looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old I won't judge. I had a blast. ,negative
 Upon writing this review I have difficulty trying to think of what to write about. Nothing much happens in this film. The storyline is a South Asian woman who falls for an English Londoner. The problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak. At the same time her friend at work is unknowingly to her having sexual relations with her brother and it just escalates from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. As soon as all this stuff has happened it's all pretty much standard. It drags slightly even though it's only about 90 minutes long. This is more of a Chick Flick than anything else. So if you're male I do not recommend this film to you. ,negative
 I'm no director or writer or anything related to a movie. But watching more than 1 movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not. So here it is: The quick and the undead is a rip-off of the Quick and the Dead. I was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it. But oh no I was really in for an very big disappointment. To put it simply the movie sucks. I'm a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistent. But I have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of squirm. If you're a big fan of zombies watch this. If you're not...better look for other rob zombie films. ,negative
 A typical old b&w film. The dialogues are sometimes good but too often - especially in the second half - they get naive sometimes awfully naive occasionally close to the point where they are unintentionally comical. The first third with its background information on Ladd's Gatsby shown with a series of interesting flashbacks is the best part of the movie. But once Gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves on Betty Field the film gets overly melodramatic. The ending is yet another cop-out ending; I don't know whether the novel itself contains this dumb clichéd ending or whether the movie's producer made some changes to it but I've always considered car-accidents to be a poor way to add drama to the conclusion of a story. I've seen this plot-device a million times (or if it's not a car then it's a fall from a horse); the writer doesn't know how to end the story but he knows that he wants it to be dramatic so he adds in a car-accident. Lame. And to make things worse the accident is outrageously coincidental and preposterous both plot-wise and time-wise; plot-wise because Field's husband's mistress (Winters) gets killed by Field and the fact that Winters sort of rushes out from the gas-station into the street as though she'd never noticed in the years that she had lived in it that there was a dangerous road right across her house - and of course at the very moment that she comes out she sees Ladd's car and mistakes it for Field's husband's car and then shouts Over here! I'm here! Run me over and make the ending tragic that way! ; time-wise because Ladd and Field get involved in an accident at the very day when they are preparing to tell Field's husband about their affair. Basically there is just too much forced and artificial irony in this accident. It also doesn't exactly help this movie how Winters's husband Da Silva goes on a revenge mission to kill the guy who ran over his wife; he basically does this by walking around like a zombie going from car to car looking for scratches and acting very badly indeed. Both Da Silva's acting and his character's behaviour throughout the film are awful and confusing respectively. Scott Fitzgerald was upset on a couple of occasions how his novels were adapted for the screen by Hollywood's screenwriters and - although he was dead long before this movie was done - he might have been right to complain judging by this film's naive script. Or maybe his novels are even sillier and more naive than this film and were actually improved upon by the screen adaptations. Or the films are pretty much like the novels. I could of course read this particular novel to find out but I just can't be bothered. Fitzgerald's name doesn't exactly inspire me to read any of his books (and I don't mean the way his name sounds.) He was certainly no Heller Clavell or Twain. More like Hemingway  a lot of noise about nothing. ,negative
 I challenge you to watch this film and deny the above statement. That is IF you can stop looking at her practically flawless face. She also does a bit of fighting and a bit of shooting but not nearly as much as I was hoping for. The film is extremely slow-moving and low-budgeted though at least they tried to find an excuse for the spaceship being so underpopulated; nearly the entire crew is on suspended animation and the ship moves on auto pilot! And the heroine doesn't rescue any of them or bring anything useful back home ; it seems that tricking that evil lady into traveling through space was the only part of her mission that couldn't be more easily accomplished by the missiles that blow up the ship at the end. There are also some long but rather tame soft-core scenes and a couple of Alien -rip-off monsters that kill about 2 people. *1/2 out of 4. ,negative
 The opening scene makes you feel like you're watching a high school play. But I've seen high school plays with better acting! Every line was delivered so obviously that I felt like I was watching actors work instead of seeing characters. I found the character development to be poor and the acting very forced! I found that 25 minutes into the movie I really didn't care what happened anymore because the plot was overly obvious and I was bored. I kept hanging in there waiting for the film to redeem itself but it never happened. Sister Theresa was overly sweet even for a nun yet appeared impulsive and slightly manipulative. All in all I was mighty disappointed. ,negative
 This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in. This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny he isn't. The movie had only one good part and this may be considered a spoiler by some and that the beginning credits were animated. If the whole movie had been animated it might have been good. I had no intention of seeing this movie when I saw the ads for it and the only reason I did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. This is the first and probably only movie I have ever walked out on. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a score of -100. ,negative
 Ah yet another Seagal movie.In no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad as Submerged?No.But that is not saying much.Like perfume on a pig. Seagal is professional thief who wants to quit but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.He lands in Prison and is befriended by a Gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback. Its good to see Seagal finally not playing an agent cop or what he usually plays.We actually get a USA Location in Las Vegas it seems. Then an eastern European territory as usual. There is no wire-Fu either here.Don Fauntleroy does an okay job. However most of the action and fight scenes with Stevie are clearly doubles.Scenes from other movies a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation.Seagal and Treech make a so-so team inspiring(unintentional) laughs one minute.Sighs the rest. Several notable faces turn up to slum it.. sleepy Kevin Tighe is a long way from his emergency days.Nick Mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check.No more rappers.Please? At this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever.Its a stale scene that Seagal needs to get out of or hang it up.He should have gotten out a while ago. ,negative
 I haven't seen this movie in years the last time i did i was really drunk after 5 pints of tenant's at my local Witherspoon's but even then i though it was quite awful. this movie is pretty terrible compared to the other critters movies the first two were quite good 3 was quite crap but miles better than this. The story takes place 53 years after critter's 3 were Charlie the bounty hunter from the previous movies is found floating in a pod in outer space by a crew of some kind of space miner em people and taken on board. Once on board the last critter eggs left in the galaxy which Charlie has brought with him from Earth crack open and we then have critters on board the space ship cue an obvious 'Alien' rip off and a lot of terrible FX and you pretty much have this movie in a nutshell. only good thing is when we are re-introduced to UG(or so we are lead to believe) who is now a villain and wants to preserve the critters instead of destroying them ,negative
 ...But it definitely still only deserves 4/10 stars and no more. A moronic dumb kid's father is a fighter pilot who gets shot down by some Arab country. They never name the country in the movie its really ridiculous they just vaguely refer to some Arab nation this movie is really ignorant like that. But Lamar from Revenge of the Nerds is in here he is friends with the main character Doug Masters. Well Doug Masters who lives on an Air Force base his father is an air force pilot yet he fails to get into the air force academy conceives of a plot (with help from his retarded friends) to steal two jets and go rescue his father. Yea exactly - this is One of the Greatest Films Ever Made!!! Louis Gossett Jr is fantastic in his role. You can tell he basically wanted to smack the hell out of Doug Masters the whole movie. Well anyway you can probably guess how the plot ends I can't believe they made 3 sequels to this movie. ,negative
 It actually pains me to say it but this movie was horrible on every level. The blame does not lie entirely with Van Damme as you can see he tried his best but let's face it he's almost fifty how much more can you ask of him? I find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together Undisputed 2; arguably the best (western) martial arts movie in years created this. Everything from the plot to the dialog to the editing to the overall acting was just horribly put together and in many cases outright boring and nonsensical. Scott Adkins who's fight scenes seemed more like a demo reel was also terribly underused and not even the main villain which is such a shame because 1) He is more than capable of playing that role and 2) The actual main villain was not only not intimidating at all but also quite annoying. Again not blaming Van Damme. I will always be a fan but avoid this one. ,negative
 Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves civilized however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized. ,negative
 Okay... she's on the boat with this guy realizes he's out to kill her knocks him out and then finds the reason he's out to off her is this disk that got her coworker killed. So what would any rational person do? Maybe conk him over the head again to make sure he's really out?? Tie him up?? Look Sandra honey you've got the chance to escape while the guy is out for only so long. Until you know how long it will take you take you to escape make sure he's not able to come after you. I HATE these stupid female victim roles. The rest of the movie was just a series of twists and turns that were completely convoluted and too unbelievable to remain interesting. ,negative
 Camp Blood looked great when I was buying it but when I watched it boy was I wrong. Its tacky the acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is shocking. Being a movie fan I usually find humour from tragic horror but at times I couldn't even laugh. Maybe Camp Blood 2 will be an improvement. ,negative
 My mom would not let me watch this film when I was in grade 2 because she said it was too violent. Well years later and the only reason I remember this film is because of my mom I stayed up and watch it on PBS. Well maybe the build up after all these year lead to the big disapointment of this film but I found it lame. It did not age well and this made the acting choppy huge unbelievable holes in the script but there is a few cool scenes like car chases and a big gun fight. I will not stay up for this film again. ,negative
 I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his trash movies but nearly every time I see one of them I just see missed opportunities and plots that don't play out well. This film is unfortunately no different. The film certainly had a lot of potential as Franco has fused the intriguing theme of the classic film 'The Most Dangerous Game' with his usual brand of trashy sleaze but the plot here gets lost too often and it takes an eternity for Franco to get round to the main point of the movie. With this being a later Franco film you might be forgiven for thinking that the director would have got better but actually I've found that the opposite is true; as this and the terrible 'Killer Barbys' are two of his very worst films. The plot focuses on a stripper and her sleazy boyfriend. The pair is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover. However they soon find that they haven't been invited there for social reasons as they are 'released' on the island so that the wealthy woman and her friends can hunt them down for sport! What attracted me to this film was the front cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of sleaze flicks. You'd think then that I'd be pleased that the movie features a plethora of sex scenes and general sleaze; but I'm not. The reason for this is mostly that the sex and sleaze in the film is really boring and most of the time served only in giving me the condition known as 'itchy fast forward finger'. However my inclination to see everything through to the end ensured that I had to lump it. There was a time when I didn't think girl-on-girl could possibly be boring but I have since been proved wrong. The only positive I can pluck out the movie really is that the soundtrack is quite catchy and despite it being silly foreign pop music; actually blends quite well with the sex scenes. I did enjoy the last ten minutes; as that's when the plot finally got going but it was a case of too little too late and unfortunately this is a severely lacklustre film. On the whole I only recommend this film to those who feel they must see all 180+ Franco movies...everyone else should watch Vampyros Lesbos Faceless or She Killed in Ecstasy instead. ,negative
 **** Possible Spoiler **** If you were making a serious movie involving a powerful but aging father with three apparently ungrateful daughters featuring actors of the highest caliber with great cinematography and a beautiful Midwestern setting now where would you go with it? Why you'd fashion a modern tragedy after King Lear of course. That's what I was expecting. That certainly wasn't what I got. What I got was 105 minutes of feminist tripe--one long harangue about man's inhumanity to woman. Why there wasn't a decent male in the entire story. You see early on where this film might be headed but you can't believe anyone would waste all these fine actors and craftsmen on that trite scenario--you just want them to get on with the King Lear theme. But it never happens; and there's the real tragedy if you ask me. Aside from the panorama of glorious rural heartland about the only thing worth watching in this film was that wonderful chameleon British actor Colin Firth practicing his Midwestern accent. Now there was a treat. 3/10 ,negative
 Absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in English class. This is literally one of the worst films I have ever seen. It totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present so the story is just really really dull. Thank god the 80's are over and god save whatever man was actually born as James Bond III . ,negative
 I saw and have the original 1959 black and white that stars Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins and no matter how many times I watch it I can't help but not to cry. This version was (obviously) a set like the 1959 was but there were so many mistakes in layout. Spiral staircase? Items that did not exist in that time period existed in the film. Doris Roberts sad to say CANNOT play drama she a comedic actress and that will not change. James Coco was a horrible Mr. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel resembled a college professor of mine rather then the dentist he was supposed to play. In the original film Anne walked the gauntlet to go to Peter's room that seemed to take her more then a minute. In this crappy remake it took her under 10 seconds. The first reviewer was correct... This remake is just that a remake. What was the director thinking casting comedic actors in a drama role like that. I'm sorry but James Coco cannot play drama. Max.. Schell was better in Deep Impact then this movie. The cranky Mrs. Frank was just that cranky I couldn't stand her. Referencing and comparing to the 1959 version I like her better she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother. Out of 10 stars I give this remake 3. Don't waste your time get the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex. ,negative
 Filmmaker Bryan Forbes who once displayed a light sardonic touch with beguiling material such as Whistle Down the Wind and the original Stepford Wives completely bottoms out here. Not only is his direction inept he also sloppily adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel; the results are atrocious. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger chewing the scenery is a hot-under-the-collar cop (it's easily his most embarrassing performance). The only actor here to exhibit some life is Elliott Gould who knows a thing or two about enlivening a bum script. Bland choppy and produced on the cheap. NO STARS from **** ,negative
 Since I am required to write minimum of 10 lines and this garbage deserves not only a single one I'll start with the following: 1. I voted AWFUL for this dreadful so called movie . 2. Let me explain why these turkeys Mr. David Varod produces are shot mainly in my beautiful homeland Bulgaria (just in BTW for the illiterate people around - this country is IN EUROPE based north to Greece and has absolutely nothing to do with Mexico and Uruguay) Some years ago NU Image has invaded our country and started making crappy mostly direct-to-video releases. Why here? Because here they pay derisively low fees to the Bulgarian crew and to the Bulgarian actors (most of them distinguished ones) which are in many ways better than most of their American colleagues. Personally I am ashamed of that fact. The reason is of course the greediness of the Americans involved and their wish to get most if not all of the profit. Actually it would't be so bad if only the production wasn't so filthy and pale. There hasn't been a good picture shot here for years. At present NU image is being sued here over the very questionably purchasing of our national cinema production centre called Boyana Films. No doubt about it there has been corruption there has been deceit there has been a lies in this recent purchase. The Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live the Bulgarian cinema! ,negative
 I bought Jack-O a number of months ago at a Blockbuster video sale and at the time I wasn't expecting anything outstanding from it. Upon watching it I realized I not only got less than I could have ever bargained for but a whole lot more as well. It seems strange I know. And it is. But it's perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is Jack-O The movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow thru ancestral ties he is marked for death at the hands of a demented scythe wielding Pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's Great-grandfather-uncle-cousin-etc and now that the villain has been resurrected Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hell-bred mission of vengeance. Anyway much horror ensues as Jack-O hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling Shawn to the finish. I'm not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who may find any worth in this movie. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time. The acting is deadpan (except when it should be) the script is apparently a 1st grade group project and the production budget must not have exceeded $150. Some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this anti-thriller and they're all the more humorous when you realize director Steve Latshaw actually seems serious in his movie-making. And yet I heartily enjoyed the film. I can call it a terrible horror movie yes. But I can also say I had a great time watching it with my friends and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie intolerable and needlessly time-consuming and that's understandable. If you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously you'll find Jack-O an instant classic which is also understandable. That's why it's so hard to rate this movie. If I were rating Jack-O's quality as a film I wouldn't give it anything. In fact the studio would owe me stars. Yet if I were rating it's on the basis of pure enjoyment I'd give it an 8 or a 9. I'll give it a 4 so to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone go out rent this and form their own conclusion. ,negative
 I want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie. The acting was horrific! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never look at them the same again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise. Everyone knows they never could act. Thankfully only Dan attempted an accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from Minnesota. I hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. The only reason I was able to sit through the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read. ,negative
 Ever have one of those sneezes that seems to build up forever? You gasp and you convulse and you grab the nearest paper product in preparation for the world's greatest hanky-blower...and then it fizzles. Frankenhooker was the cinematic equivalent of that lost sneeze. Now I'm big on B-movies and I always look the other way when a boom mike pops onscreen or an actor speaks his or her lines with all the enthusiasm of Gerald Ford but this one really let me down. The cover of the video for instance IS the tag-line of the whole movie. Using parts from murdered New York prostitutes Dr. Franken rebuilds his deceased fiancee only to have her run amok in Manhattan as a sort of superprostitute with a bad attitude. After an hour and a half of build-up this fairly funny ten minutes seemed a little anti-climactic. ,negative
 Martin Lawrence could be considered a talented man but those days are long gone. Runteldat shows a man who at once tries to play the sympathy card to his plight yet takes responsibility for it whenever he thinks it'll benefit his ego. The sad truth is that at this point in his life his best days were behind him: his half-funny show was dead in the water after his co-star left and to today he faces a career of voice acting and god awful action films. One gets the impression that this concert film wasn't made to give Lawrence's career another boost after his humiliation but rather a childish attempt to clear the air by both trying to pathetically salvage what remained of his life and somehow twist it into something to be proud of some defining moment in which he showed himself to have 'earned' his fame. Sadly the concert is nothing but a gravelly-voiced Martin incoherently trying to be funny invoke pathos and then claim he doesn't care about it at all because hardcore. The sad truth is that this is the real public embarrassment for Lawrence: the way he rambles on invoking sad pity laughter makes you wish that he would just strip down to his underwear on stage wave a gun around and just reenact it all over again. There is no real insight to his performance at all. Much like the childish title states Martin is trying to make his ultimate moment of truth his own in his way and fails miserably. He would have been better off waiting for the E! True Hollywood Story instead of running on a stage and making an idiot out of himself for the second time. Perhaps the saddest thing about this concert film--or rather career eulogy--is that Martin didn't put any thought into this. What was this film supposed to prove? Sadly that his fame was fleeting he was a flash in the pan before the underwear incident and now that the only way he can get work is piggybacking Will Smith or a Pixar production. They might as well called this concert 'Tombstone' because that's what it is. Martin Lawrence just dies on stage here and with it goes what could have been an interesting career. Now? Just a pathetic side note in history. ,negative
 the worst movie i have ever seen i didn't even watch it all i just fast forwarded it to Burt's bits and then the end!!! he is the only reason to watch this!! i have to admit to owning a copy as i am a HUGE Burt fan (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection i wouldn't care when this movie came out i had a nightmare renting ti as my local store only had 2 copies and fans of all the various stars always beat me there imagine my disappointment when i sat down and watched this movie!! THERE ARE JUST NO REDEEMING QUALITIES ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!! Absolutely NOTHING WHAT SO EVER TO LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!! this movie became a running joke between myself and a mate Burt's worst!! Rob Lowe's worst WORST HOUR AND A HALF OF MY LIFE ,negative
 A film about an interesting and sensitive period of history filmed in beautiful surroundings managed to present an appallingly trivial and clichéd production grossly clumsy script poor continuity intrusive slushy music sugary casting and pallid acting. It was a toss up between the script and the acting as to which was worse. The script probably won - the historical background backstory and character descriptions were spelt out in painful detail in the dialogue. .. actually words can't describe quite how bad this film is. In a pre-release screening there was a massive exodus from about thirty minutes in. At about an hour many of those who remained were laughing loudly. I should add I am a Francophile I am fascinated by Canada and love historical film. This really was a one off. ,negative
 A really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities. It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks I'm not sure. She jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie. She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff...). He's taking photographs and she's translating an esoteric German book about witches I think. Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman I thought was their daughter. Evidently she was an architect and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple's children. I guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately). The hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isn't used to any great effect. An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder. People start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are OK but not enough to recommend the movie. Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. Much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots since we're not seeing anything ourselves. The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone. He looked particularly nasty. There's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave Exorcist behind her (except for the yearly horror conventions). In the weird largely Italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That is it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse La (1988) - it's not (that's also a better movie than this one). La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than those). There's also a Casa 5 La (1990) AKA House 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987) The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III and House IV (1992). How's The Horror Show fit in there? It doesn't really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) confusion. Oddly The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Does your head hurt yet? ,negative
 Carmen is a prostitute that lives seducing and stealing soldiers of the Spanish army; she is without any doubt the best femme fatale at the moment. When a man resist her charming attentions she decides to do everything to destroy him. At the end he falls in her web and he will be forced to make all the things he ever hated only for being with Carmen. Despite Paz Vega is very beautiful she doesn't seem a gypsy (as Carmen is) and neither her acting nor Sbaraglia's are good. The story results very boring and in most moments it is very absurd while intending to appear truthful. in the same way are the scenarios and the Special Effects despite not being but they are not but acceptable and too much artificial for a historic film as it is. To sum up boring and bad with a very absurd development there are much betters thing to watch. ,negative
 Pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie. Nor is it terrible. The acting was wooden at least on Pinocchio's part.The puppet had all of 2 expressions.As did most of the actors except strangely enough...the secondary characters...most of them were enjoyable over the top. The special effects in this are pretty B and as I said earlier the puppet really blew. The 2 best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand...looked pretty good i think they spent about a 1/3 of the budget on that...and the shower scene...WOW...I think they must have spent the other 2/3rds of the budget on talking the actress who did that scene to do it.Outstanding. Seriously this is a slightly below average b horror puppet movie...rent Chucky if you have a urge to see puppets kill. The story had a few interesting idea's enough to keep me watching it to the end. ,negative
 In one sense I kind of liked this movie because of a 'mindless' positive atmosphere it sort of conveys. I had a problem with an aspect of the plot but more about that later. First the characters were a little goofy and one dimensional. The 'good people' had similar physical and character traits and the 'bad people' had similar physical and character traits ... hmmm. The basic storyline was OK (pretty simple and standard) - nothing too exciting or objectionable. The main attraction was of course the miniature dinosaurs - kind of a nice fantasy element to have. However they had a very minimal presence in the movie. Outside of that the movie kept a brisk pace and didn't get too bogged down in any one place. I liked this about the movie. The problem I had with the plot had to do with the the idea of stealing . I think this movie may not have been thought out enough - something's wrong especially if this is a kid's movie. I'll keep the next sentence abstract to not be a spoiler (skip it if you're worried). The 'good guys' do some stealing and they don't have the same info the audience has - so it's just stealing and that's kind of a bad thing for a kid's movie. Overall if you have kids because of a questionable plot aspect I'd consider passing. However this whole movie is pretty low key anyway so it may not matter. Pass this one if you have any other interesting choices. ,negative
 This movie has it all: it is a thriller a chase movie a romance story a mob tale a comedy a road movie... well in fact it's none of this at all. All the time you are waiting for something interesting to happen but no you are still watching the same dull uninspiring and superficial cliché of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. Even the star cast acting is lacking in credibility. A hit man with his quirks a girl who's playing hard to get mob guys acting tough and incapable cops yawn... I'd recommend not to watch Backtrack. If you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor go and see 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada' by Tommy Lee Jones. Now that's what I call worth watching. ,negative
 I have always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular movies. I also have always enjoyed so-bad-it's-good flicks you're looking at someone who actually liked recent cheese filled kid flicks like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). So I watched this and it turned out that all the critics are right about this one. It's a MAJOR flop but unlike a lot of flops it isn't even enjoyable on any level not even just to make fun of. It's just one boring cringe-fest after another all the way through. I had been warned. I didn't listen. I am a fool. Don't be a fool don't waste time and money on this pile of trash. ,negative
 I was so looking forward to seeing this at the film festival in Sydney. I left the theater like many others before the end credits because I couldn't sit through it any longer. It was badly shot the sound sucks and the acting was worse than an episode of The Love Boat. Now I know why this film hasn't been able to find an American distribution company to release it in the United States. This screams of a low budget high school production. ,negative
 Excerpt from TV GUIDE: This week on THE LOVE BOAT Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo! Join the Captain Isaac Gopher and Julie in a fun-filled Halloween Special. Guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the Chupacabra. This is typical lame Sci-Fi Channel cut-rate fare. The Captain of a cruise ship played by the once respectable John Rhys-Davies is in charge of a Carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is along for the ride and she's earning her keep by being the ship's kickboxing instructor. Pay attention everyone that kickboxing will come in handy later! It should be noted that the Captain's daughter is pretty uncoordinated and painful to watch. It would have been good if she might have taken a couple of kickboxing classes before trying to play an instructor in a movie. Captain Stupid and his daughter join Mrs. Thurston Howell from Gilligan's Island a kooky cryptozoologist and a dark mysterious stranger on this 90- minute ride into boredom. That's right I said cryptozoologist. He keeps mentioning that he brought some precious cargo on board that he needs to check out. Needless to say the box contains a Chupacabra that somebody decides to let out. From this point on a man in the rubber Chupacabra suit runs around the ship killing people. Captain Stupid is powerless to stop it. He decides to call in the Marines but telling them that there are a bunch of terrorists on his ship. The Marines respond. They say all that Marine-speak stuff like Hooya and Get Some . But those silly Marines are no match for a Chupacabra. They don't really tell anyone where they're going either so there's no help in sight. I guess no one will really miss some lame battalion of lost Marines. But don't forget... Captain Stupid's daughter is thankfully a Kickboxing instructor. Yay for Little Stupid! She comes in right in the nick of time she beats up the bloodthirsty Goat Sucker and saves the day. Chupacabra means Goat Sucker. Therefore Chupacabras suck. But there's no way that Chupacabras suck anywhere near as much as this movie. ,negative
 It's too slow paced and complex for children and too lightweight and dull for adults. None of our family (6 weeks to 66 years) could be bothered watching it all the way through. Are there jokes in it? I couldn't really tell. There was certainly some unnecessarily adult innuendo. There was probably a bludgeoning message of sorts but I wasn't engaged enough to care. The live talent are just stumbling and mugging their way through it. I have to wonder if they were actually being paid or whether it was some form of community service or plea bargain. Please keep watching whines Daniel; honestly I wouldn't bother. ,negative
 I don't normally write reviews in fact I never write reviews. This film was so atrocious it actually inspired me to start. Virtual Sexuality attempts to be a light hearted and cheeky teenage comedy regarding the usual trappings; virginity boys etc. except the main character apparently turns into her perfect boy that she has created using the help of a machine at a technology fair. Sound interesting? Well it isn't. The acting is the most half-hearted and appalling I have ever seen. The unfortunate thing is they appear to be genuinely supportive of script and movie which probably explains why I have never seen them in any memorable production since. I have not bothered to learn the actors names nor their characters. The lading lady does not enrapture or charm you and thus you do not care for her whatsoever. The leading lady's male friend raises no sympathy even when the script is vociferously screaming for you to pity him. The only rise he will get out of you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half decent actor was the blonde leading man who despite his miserably weak role really gave it all he could which wasn't much in the light of such a horrendous piece of work. I will not even talk about the acting abomination that are the 'bad guys' of the plot. But then again what plot? I watched this film unfold incredulously as I had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the foolish audacity to write such a script nevermind produce act in and direct it. I can only wonder. The only reason my companion and I continued to watch such a mangled example of film was the disbelieving laughter it managed to arise out of us as cohesion logic class and even impotent storyline were disregarded within half an hour into the film. I have completely no idea why anyone wanted to violate the movie industry by releasing this to the public. This is a joke of a film and is best left to gather dust in warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 out of 10. If that. ,negative
 A man is pulled off a London Street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect. Dull banal film bored the hell out of me. More an idea then a film. I was half way into this 77 minute film when I realized I had no idea who anyone on screen was. It was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character. Certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough. Its not. And while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it especially if one has seen the other better films of a similar ilk (rendition with Reese Witherspoon for example) ,negative
 In spite of its high-minded ambitions Zurlini's film must be seen as a failure. It's one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist (which I think is what Zurlini was attempting). It's another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and meaninglessly episodic. Despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location - and a wonderful score - the film never lures the audience in. Too much is unintentionally funny (the phony sound of dripping water in Drago's quarters for example or the silent-movie mugging by some of the actors) or simply confusing (Why exactly does Drago want to leave the fort the first time?) for the film to succeed as a coherent work. ,negative
 There seems to be a whole sub genre of cheap tired old sex comedies out there that say the same old things about middle class couples. Sort of like Friends but with more soft porn and no wit. This film is no exception- it had situations so familiar I died from deja vu. People sat on couches spinning out clichés about sex and relationships? Check. Monogamy versus cheating with some woman/man who would never look twice in reality at some other woman/man? Check. PORN The BADDIES!!!!111? Check. Some guy/girl in it who happens to be the only reason you're watching this rubbish? Check. The lesson seems to be- when it doubt make a tired old sex comedy about people no one cares anything about in order to make some statement that everybody has already heard three thousand times before. That'll get your film made. It'll even attract some sitcom nobody in a bad wig! ,negative
 Fool for Love is one of the several now forgotten films Robert Altman directed throughout the 1980s. This one a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role just simply isn't very good. Altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career and many times the fault was his. But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a flimsy play. Altman's direction is assured the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere and takes its time getting there. Shepard is Eddie a stuntman who has a love/hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes. Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman caller. The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddie's and May's relationship is incestuous. However this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots. The last half hour or so of the film is especially bad when Eddie's and May's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone somnolent voice over. Chalk this up to another of Altman's experiments gone awry. Grade: C- ,negative
 After reading both _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_ I can't begin to express how disappointed I was with this film. While I agree some poetic license may be admissible this movie is at constant variance with the books doing an incredible injustice to the exciting plausible and wonderful stories written by Wilbur Smith. I can only believe that the writers director and producers of the movie have never even heard of Mr. Smith let alone read his work. Smith's vibrant characterizations are converted into wooden stick figures all historicity is ignored or discounted the realism of the books has been changed to include phantom monsters more appropriate to a cartoon. And why is an Egyptian henchman speaking Spanish? Geesh no wonder the movie was made into a TV miniseries! Did Wilbur Smith have any input into the making of this movie? I can't believe that he did. Terrible terrible movie. If you've read either or both of the books don't waste your time or money watching this money. You will be sorely disappointed I assure you. Only a moment of supreme generosity persuaded me to give this movie a ranking of '2' and that only because of the beautiful sometimes spectacular photography. ,negative
 The Racketeer stars Carol (deprived of the e that usually appeared at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic and torn between her love for him and the interest of New York crime kingpin Robert Armstrong (top-billed). It's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction immobile cameras stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines. At the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s-l-o-w-l-y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs. Done about five years later this could have been an interesting movie but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder's dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know Lombard and Armstrong had from watching their later movies. The Racketeer was made in 1929 a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces  Vidor's Hallelujah! Mamoulian's Applause Wyler's Hell's Heroes Capra's Ladies of Leisure  all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically. Too bad Howard Higgin wasn't that strong; as it is watching a naturally rapid-paced actor like Armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he's been told to speak one can't help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him. ,negative
 ok i am really into King's stuff but this is just dreadful. the whole movie i am waiting for the main character to do something profound with his new youth and power. i can tolerate the worst of movies as anything is better than watching a cut movie with commercials in it. but this takes the cake. i gave it a 2 and i would never recommend it to anyone. ,negative
 Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of movie-making was out of favour in the late seventies). Rather it more closely resembles a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least the shortened 150 minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a video nasty. As one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of 'Penthouse' there is much naked flesh to be seen and the film lovingly catalogues Caligula's sexual perversions including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla. What is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence as though Bob Guccione Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone. (It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called 'Brass' and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called 'Gore'). Characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. The Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles so the film's concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. I do however question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' and 'Gladiator' were set during the reign of Commodus an Emperor quite as cruel and licentious as Caligula. In neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of 'Up Pompeii!' 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and both those films are artistically far better than 'Caligula'. The acting in the film is not particularly bad with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a suitably insane Caligula. (Suitable that is in the context of this film. The real Caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill). The great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished British actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only Dame of the British Empire with a past as a porn star) it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy but heaven alone knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike some other famous stage actors such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton Gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of Nerva a decent and honourable Senator of the old school. Unfortunately in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill. Guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence. (Whether Brass and Vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question). The film does not however succeed upon any other level either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of dictatorship. Even seen as erotica it is second-rate. 4/10 ,negative
 I would hate to have anyone watch this inspired by a true story movie and draw any conclusions about the true event. Few things they did get right were overshadowed by the things that were just not true. Ed Gein never dragged anyone behind a car never met up with anyone at the graveyard and killed them no proof he returned body parts to the graveyard. The things he did were awful enough why try to make it worse? This movie ranks among my 10 worst wastes of eye strain. In the Light of the Moon is a much better film on the subject it is more factual and the acting is superior in contrast to this one. ,negative
 I was expecting a lot more of this film than what I actually got. The acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of something I don't to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy. An example of the acting is when Paxton's character Vann is upset the South Vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the sand map . It was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic. To make things worse I have no idea how I'm supposed to feel about Vann. He's obviously presented as the protagonist but as soon as he gets to Vietnam he starts an affair with an Vietnamese English teacher. The only thing the movie had going for it was that it wasn't particularly boring. I give it 4 stars out of 10. ,negative
 Why is impossible to write in french ? Very Kitch! This journey in the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities nevertheless current in 1976. These big Casimir of monsters is completely ridiculous! The film deserve however a remake as was KING KONG (the last one) with a little more supplied scenario. The professor has resemblances with the Professor Calculus and is rather funny. David (the character) is enough inconsistent but cross(spend) to the people from below a good message you unite and will overcome you! Altogether we would say a film made in the 40s. Now that I said everything (or almost) the evil of which i thought of it we can say that if we have the brain get tired or anything has to see of the other one then the thing(matter) is even rather entertaining. Hugh! Such is my opinion! (translating French to English with Reverso : sorry for possible mistakes !) ,negative
 After watching this film I decided that it was so awful that I must join IMDb and write a review to warn other people of the pit falls of renting/buying this film. To be fair to the film there is only one good section to this film and that is the end credits cause then you know that this crap is well and truly over. I watched it to the end in the hope that I may get a little bit of pleasure out of the film. Just tunnels more tunnels and an old man talking to himself (If you watch this film too many time so will you). As for Val if he keeps selecting films like this he may as well kiss goodbye to his acting career. There is no point in even writing about what is in the film as that has already been done. Keep your money and sanity and keep well clear. ,negative
 Okay so writer/director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye-catching names. Good for him! Now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here. Hell Ride isn't a movie; it's a hectic and hopelessly inept fan-boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker-flicks of the 60's and to the recently revived Grindhouse cinema formula in general. With Hell Ride Larry Bishop embarrassingly fails in his set-up and there are many obvious reasons for this. He hasn't got a story to tell  or at least not a very interesting one  but gravely tries to cover this up through numerous redundant plot twists loads of gratuitous and very women-unfriendly sleaze overlong and piteous dialogs aspiring to be cool and giant amounts of senseless violence. The plot looks complex but can actually be summarized in one sentence. The ancient vendetta between two rivaling biker gangs flares up again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or not be the long lost son of a double-crossing wench that got executed back in 1976. That's it seriously! All the rest going from betraying gang members over to the recruitment of old timer members over to toying with his nymphomaniac informant girl is all completely pointless and confusing padding material. Another major problem in Hell Ride is Larry Bishop's very own tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego. He definitely shouldn't have rewarded himself with the role of tough and relentless gang leader as that only comes across as incredibly pretentious and narrow-minded; especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie. Granted Bishop starred in a couple of genuine 60's biker exploitation movies (like The Savage Seven and Angel Unchained ) but that was a long time ago and he honestly isn't any good as an actor. Maybe it simply was Bishop's life-long dream to play a character that always outsmarts his enemies and for which every hot babe sexually craves and just wrote a whole screenplay around it. The veterans in the cast like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen don't really bother to leave a plausible impression and I can't say I blame them. This whole production is lame and pathetic and I can't bring myself to recommending it to anyone regardless of many beautiful babes parade around with bare breasts and naked butts. ,negative
 The opening credits are pure poetry and I have watched it several times. It had a corny 20's adventure feel to it. Of course Kathy is gorgeous but that voice! Did she realize this was a talkie. One word--voice coach. Great film for chronic insomnia (along with a bottle of scotch). ,negative
 Wow... just... wow. There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own. I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing - whoo boy does it ever. However I think there is some other problems here. 1. Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? The film acts as though you just can't be a Christian and also allow for the possibility? Why? They ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e. The Bible doesn't say there is aliens. Well the Bible doesn't say there isn't.) but the actual rebuttal is never answered. The Bible really doesn't say there isn't. So how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand? Or better yet acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite God there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them. 2. How come the ONLY two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax? What about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences? What if it's something else entirely? Too bad the film makers already have their minds made up. 3. The film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult. That's a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present. I'm not necessarily arguing that they don't but if you're going to say something so asinine you'd better have the facts to back it up. 4. Why does the other reporter (not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy the other one) always have his hands in his pockets? It's hard to take someone seriously when they're constantly playing pocket pool. I WISH this had been an exploration of Christian faith and UFO phenomena but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their Faith Message to care much about make a thought provoking movie. As a Christian myself this saddens me. ,negative
 Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and Q T the plot is very superficial and lame and unless indirectly intended this film actually glorify the Nazis and portrays them as men of honor and show that the Jewish people are deceiving cant keep promises and bloody vicious. ((THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler together with the most notorious Nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game STUPID the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards including Oscars as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the Jewish people but hey reconsider its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole Nazi - Jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis. ,negative
 This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. It features a bar with no visible staff or customers a university with no students a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are dire - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem. Pretty entertaining for its pure comedy value but I cannot believe that this thing actually masquerades as a serious drama. Bonkers. ,negative
 Geoffrey Wright the director of Romper Stomper transplants Shakespeare's Macbeth in the contemporary criminal underworld of Melbourne Australia. The result is a semi-awful piece of cinema. Sam Worthington is Macbeth and walks around looking very self-conscious and bored. Victoria Hill who wrote the script with Wright is Lady Macbeth and she's neither awful nor good. Lachy Hulme who plays McDuff is the only actor in the cast who exudes any kind of authority. The rest including Gary Sweet are wasted and misdirected. Shot on HD by the late Will Gibson the movie's visuals lack character. Everything is too clean and too deliberately lit. Wright's direction is uninspired in the extreme and the action sequences are confusing and inept. Marketed erroneously as the most violent Australia movie ever the film is violent at times and reasonably bloody but it fails to deliver a single impactful moment. Slow moving and terribly pretentious this umpteenth silver screen version of the classic play is the personification of wrong-headed. ,negative
 The movie starts good it has a thing going for it. About 1/3 into the movie things go downhill. Carrey starts obsessing about the number 23 because he sees it everywhere. So what? Thats no reason to go nuts and start writing stuff all over your body and on walls. The acting by whoever is playing his son is bad. From the get-go as soon as he hears of his fathers obsession he jumps on the bandwagon and is hysterical about it. Totally unbelievable. I hope I never see this kid in another movie again. Its a waste of time watching this movie. Grab another. Boring piece of ... well. The number is killing him? Give me a break. I won't spoil the ending for you but let's just say it is equally disappointing. 3 / 10. ,negative
 The first time I watched this show it was OK. There were some funny moments and I laughed a couple of times but this show is getting worse and worse. Carly and Sam's web show is NOT the least bit funny. They play a stupid video from the internet scream at the camera and make some very bad jokes. And then the laugh track goes off?! One problem with the show is that none of the main characters are funny. Carly is not funny. Miranda Cosgrove's acting is lackluster at best. Her acting in this show is nothing like her acting from Drake And Josh. Her friend Sam is very rude and crude and the show is written in a way that makes her look like some kind of hillbilly. I mean they make jokes about her mom driving a rusty old truck her mom smashing an old TV with a bat and then there's the jokes about Sam failing in school getting detention all the time and running from cops. None of that is funny at all. Then there's Freddy who is a computer geek. He isn't too funny unless his Mom is treating him like a baby. The show's only somewhat funny full time character is Carly's brother Spencer. He makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things like pretending to drive a space ship while making spaceship noises knocking over a girl scouts' cookie table for revenge as they did the same thing to him. His material is the only thing worth laughing at. Aside from the characters other things make the show bad too. Like the fact that a couple of kids doing a local web show from a Seattle apartment is a worldwide hit and got them a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is that how can a 26 year old single guy with no real job can pay for a 2 level apartment in downtown Seattle and raise his 13 year old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound equipment including a remote controlled projector and a green screen and an HD camera? This sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. The worst thing is that the show contains some pretty questionable content. There are a couple of times when Carly(remember a 13 year old girl) appears on her internet web show in a bikini top. WTF? Then I saw an episode where Freddy tells Carly and Sam that he slept in JUST his socks the night before. I mean WTF? Then there's an episode where Carly's rival Nevel blackmails her by taking her website rights and agrees to give her the website back in exchange for a kiss. Creepy! And I just saw an episode where Carly meets a boy who just moved into their apartment building and he has some kind of back injury and he takes off his shirt and Carly stands there drooling over him. I can't believe Nick even lets them show that kind off stuff and I can't believe that this was created by the same guy responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not appropriate for kids under the age of 12 and that's even questionable. iCarly is just another addition to the long list of awful Nick programming. ,negative
 This tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. Here people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. A well-heeled London solicitor (Tom Wilkinson) discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. He throws up but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers. Written and directed by Julian Fellowes who won an Oscar for writing Gosford Park (this is his directorial debut) from a novel by Nigel Balchin it's quite comical although I am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. It's like a throw-back to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life. However it's not all bad. Wilkinson is terrific even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson (the adulterous wife) and Rupert Everett (the highly amoral high-class totty) are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye. ,negative
 Is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after um death. Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (a soul-mate of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) provides blow-by-blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables scalpels surgical saws human entrails and warped minds. Welcome to the autopsy room! I don't know which facets of the film apart of its notorious reputation may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high rating. Storywise it's fairly simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually half an hour) of a troubled coroner (or perhaps assistant pathologist or whoever he is) that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non-traditional fashion right at his workplace. I'm perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one-note plot. I suspect it may be somehow inspired by Udo Kier's character's quirky demeanor in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. Artistic values of the film are also questionable. It's hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that don't squeeze a single word. Their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks. There's also not enough room for great camera-work - basically the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls. Authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible but only a handful of medical/forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here (if anyone cares). Honestly I used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death. Now I know that dead bodies are severed raped and humiliated intestines are ripped apart brains are retrieved from the head stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts then the body is stitched back and washed - nothing personal. And what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterward? Shock and disgust factor - it's much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover to his horror that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a Christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection. This obscure item is barely available sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended. Hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film. They are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see. Cerdà is really gifted and stylish director which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his trilogy - preceding 'The Awakening' amazing black and white short and 30-minute 'Genesis' visually stunning and moody piece with an off-beat and interesting concept. And I'm pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new more mainstream oriented material. And sooner or later 'Aftermath' would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his early warm-up works. But in the meantime I'm afraid it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations. ,negative
 I have been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time read the biography watched the specials and saw the Karen Carpenter Story. This movie really didn't show the real Karen Carpenter. In the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend). The real Karen Carpenter was much different. She was outgoing and friendly. She had lots of friends especially Olive Newton-John. The movie doesn't even show Karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy Karen . Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York she did see a psychologist but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room. Also Karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid so she could loss weight but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too. Also the Karen's husband in the movie is named Bob Knight but in real life was named Tom Burris. Also Karen wasn't divorced from Tom but only separated. Karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. Also Agnes found Karen naked in the closet unciousness unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend on seeing it. ,negative
 The Box is a film with great potential but the makers totally misused that potential. The film seemed to take for ever because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and job-dialogs between the action. Those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill. The philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds were even Harry Potter would flunked his class with! Probably the best part was that moment when Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz)has been shot to death by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will. I wonder how Hobbes would react if he could... ,negative
 It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge as well as sex. Unbeknownst to her she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her purse a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. Just call it a romp and at least a few people will show up to the theater. I'm not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in New York this past April but I sincerely hope not many. It sounds like a light and playful pinku flick but it has art-house pretensions and is really just incredibly boring. Many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations but this film's aspirations just make the time that elapses between the sex scenes excruciating. And then the sex scenes aren't even good! I've seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty Japanese movies. I've never seen this country produce something with sex this dull. The Spice Channel is more imaginative. The only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress Emi Kuroda. Otherwise this is pure torture. ,negative
 Can u believe a college professor made this film????? The same man who made DHOOP The film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes ever The main message is nice but presented badly The film looks like a collage of amateurish scenes miscasts.etc and bad performances Direction and everything is poor Music is okay Emraan's naughty streak works and he does well Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha are bad Paresh annoys when he looks at the mirror ,negative
 Nothing about this movie stands out as either being great or terrible. In the end that is what kills it. The blandness is just not good. I can't say I expected better from Will Smith but I definitely did from Kevin James of The King of Queens -- but hey I'm getting used to saying that a lot lately. This film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy but it never hits the bull's-eye. In fact it never hits *anywhere* within the target. The allergy scene is disturbing; the fact that Kevin James can't dance is something that wouldn't exactly catch anybody off-guard and is therefore (in a movie like this) not funny. This movie constantly tries to win your heart but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time. Some parts are okay (but I'm searching my brain for examples) but I really think this movie should be avoided. ,negative
 Granted HOTD 2 is better than the Uwe Boll crapfest that was the first one but thats like saying drowning is better than being chopped alive. OK OK I'm being a little bit harsh with this one its just that Video Game adaptations of Zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth. Resident Evil was alright but its sequels are pure rubbish. The first HOTD was entertaining crap more than anything else; Uwe Boll saw to that. And HOTD 2 was...better? The entertainment value was there the hot chicks were there the gore was there but... this is it? The script even though subpar was better than the first one. But in the script dwells horribly written characters stupid action sequences clichés and an ending that drags on and on reaching a level of ridiculousness which would make the Bollmeister very very proud. But it could've been worse right? HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes Sid Haig) as an insane doctor looking for a cure to death. As you may guess it all goes to sh*t. A nearby College Campus seems to be the center for the Zombie (or Hypersapien?) epidemic and as you may expect a group of Commandos and two Zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. Their main goal? No it ain't blowing sh*t up. Instead they have to get a sample of zombie blood so they can create a cure to the deadly virus. Between this and that lays bland character interactions an insufferable amount of clichés (but hey at least the black guy isn't the first one to get killed) and decent looking Zombies. The acting is passable. Who would've thought that Sticky Fingaz was a passable actor? Not me. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine somewhat as the leads. And the supporting cast was passable too. It was all passable. The make up effects on the Zombies were alright it could've been worse like in the first HOTD: just guys running around in dusty mummy suits. The gore was alright too. Cheap scares and even cheaper tension are almost non-existent in this movie which is a good thing. The action sequences were stupid as f*ck but at least there wasn't any sword fighting zombies or that ridiculous slow motion bullet effect. Overall this movie will appeal only to Zombie enthusiasts fans of the arcade games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap Horror movie for the weekend. Apparently there's going to be a third one as hinted by the ending but I wouldn't count on it. Unless Uwe decides to do it. A 4. ,negative
 Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in everyday life. As I go through my day I see blacks whites Asians Latinos etc...How do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you? I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention. I don't care if it takes place in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was one token black. This was typical in the 80's. Hey! it's 2007 with all the rappers singers and athletes working as actors Thomas Haden Church could have paid more attention to his cast. Aren't actors supposed to be more liberal? ,negative
 A SOUND OF THUNDER. One of the greatest short stories ever written. By one of the grandest Grand Masters of Fantasy Ray Bradbury. What a great story. But what a vomitous movie! In Bradbury's science fiction short story a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule Number One is: Stay On The Path a floating metallic walkway that ensures no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt a man steps off the path and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present - the world as they know it has drastically changed. Though there are paradoxes in any time travel story Bradbury's tale was a quick jugular stroke a parable of the ripple effect. A Sound of Thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia the most republished science fiction story of all time) and illustrated Chaos Theory Darwinism and The Butterfly Effect (which would only be coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's story the wonder of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed in turn overshadowed by the mortal danger to humanity's existence itself. While in the movie A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by the uneven Peter Hyams CAPRICORN ONE 2010: ODYSSEY TWO) a clutch of bad actors goes through the time portal again and again to try to rectify their mistakes like an excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The movie has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful tale except the initial jolt of the time traveling prehistoric hunting party. Egregious liberties are taken with Bradbury's story - baboon-faced reptiles plants overrunning Chicago's concrete time waves rippling through the city CGI insectoids - for which Bradbury should sue the pants and underpants and ass-hairs off the filmmakers. Novice writers Thomas Dean Donnelly Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency for thinking they could actually add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with balls this big? Ben Kingsley is the corporate owner of Time Safari with a hairpiece so bad it looks like a hairpiece Edward Burns is his lead hunter Travis and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough in BRAVEHEART) is the scientist with the best breasts. I can't possibly relate the hundreds upon thousands of egregious stupidities and asinine pieces of dialog but here is just one spoken by David Oyelowo as some kind of scientist : he refers to the Pleiades star cluster The Seven Sisters they look like stars don't they? But each of them is a whole galaxy. Uh no idiot scientist they're actually uh stars. Those three morons who rewrote Bradbury's story forgot they didn't know anything about physics or astronomy. Or writing. Best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's chest straining against her disheveled one-size-too-small blouses. --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania). ,negative
 While the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film it is not however this that lets this picture down. Rather it is the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious script that the film so obviously relied on a little too much. With an idea that had potential the simple plot is diminished still by Graham's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege. As Downey Jr proves as usual what a gifted actor he is he shadows the two actresses in their scenes together which is constantly noticeable. The pointless yet intense sex scene seems merely to exist in order to prevent the film from being too verbally expressive giving the actors a much deserved break from talking. With an unsatisfying conclusion Two Girls and a Guy has very little to recommend it other than Downey Jr's formidable if not out of place performance. ,negative
 I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept production. The Covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen. The story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of Ipswitch a survivors of the Salem witch trials. They also happen to be a part of the secret sect called The Covenant . Their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive. In theory this would make a pretty good action sci-fi movieor at least an interesting teeny flick. But there were just too many glaring downfalls that don't allow this movie to reach its plot's full potential. That acting wasn't good the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues. For sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job. The movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline or any feel of pacing. The movie has it's moments but overall was a little disappointing. A witchy 4/10 ,negative
 I've only seen most of the series since I leave the TV on as background noise in my dorm. I've been a fan of Mencia but this show really doesn't do much for me. Occasionally he'll say or do something to pull a chuckle out but he has this aura of smugness that completely ruins it. I've always thought he was funny because of his raging angry-man routine that's not terribly prevalent in this TV series. Instead he's just smug. I guess that just reflects how funny his comedy is: stale and uninteresting when he isn't in the proper mode of delivery. I've seen him get into it sometimes on his show but for the most part he just sits there smiling and looking smug and it doesn't suit him well. Just my opinion though. ,negative
 This movie was really bad plain and simple. How a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to me. It's a decent idea but it just didn't flesh out. Edward Burns is a decent actor though. I liked his small role in Saving Private Ryan. Let's get down to the big issue here. The visuals were so incredibly bad I thought I was watching an old Dinosaurs In 3D CDROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I mean I've seen cut-scenes in console games from pre-2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this. I mean heck... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this one. The lizard-monkeys were laughable. I thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from Killer Instinct I've seen better sock-puppet monsters now that I think about it. You know there's a ton of made-for-TV movies that are better than this. How does a gem like Scifi Channels The Shining get such a small audience but this load of CGI easy to make 4 Kidz gets put out in the open? I don't care if it's a Ray Bradbury story. Lameeeee ,negative
 OK this is one strange film! Fans of Ed Wood Jr. will appreciate the inventive techniques director George Barry utilizes like stock footage and cheesy voice overs. He can make a crack in the wall into a plot device! There is more humor than horror here but I found it an uneven blend. You will be laughing and crying and probably wondering why you got your hands on this. Barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of $10 000. That's 59 months and $9 900 too much! If you like your cheese on the campy side with vintage '70s gore you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack. ,negative
 Blind Date (Columbia Pictures 1934) was a decent film but I have a few issues with this film. First of all I don't fault the actors in this film at all but more or less I have a problem with the script. Also I understand that this film was made in the 1930's and people were looking to escape reality but the script made Ann Sothern's character look weak. She kept going back and forth between suitors and I felt as though she should have stayed with Paul Kelly's character in the end. He truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle Neil Hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time. Paul Kelly's character although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved Kitty (Ann Sothern) as opposed to Neil Hamilton while he did like her a lot I didn't see the depth of love that he had for her character. The production values were great but the script could have used a little work. ,negative
 Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this film I was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain and end my life. It's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. I honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. The film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. I normally don't have a problem with SOV movies are shoddily made 16mm films but this was just so awful. And where did they find these actresses ? I have seen some bad acting but this takes the cake. Watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what I mean. BCI Entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this god awful sludge. This has to be the worst film I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. I want my 74 minutes back! If you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes without either shooting your TV or committing mass homicide then give a shot. After all what have you got to lose? ,negative
 Here's example number 87 358 of Hollywood's anti-Biblical bias so typical of them. Early on Ray Liotta's wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking (dress mannerisms speech) who immediately lays down here strict rules stating that there will be two hours of Bible study ever day. This is said of course to make it sound like reading the Bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone especially a kid. Once again the Bible is equated with stuffy mean-spirited people. That woman of course is dismissed immediately. Naturally the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and voilà saves the day! Yawn. ,negative
 This film is little more than an ersatz Verhoeven. The filming is supposed to be tele-realistic but is simply sickening. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously. The Brechtian pauses for non-existent advert brakes are tedious and even painful; undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film Brechtian it was just an accident which happened like that. If you want to see a parody of reality tv watch Celebrity DeathMatch - it's funnier and wittier and most importantly shorter. I have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film. To be avoided like a rabid rabbit. ,negative
 Caligula shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 Fellini Satyricon with bizarre sights freakishness and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the glory of ancient Rome. But Fellini it ain't... First of all it is not as entertaining. Far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed rubber-faced McDowell in the titular role. His performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing. The portrayals by Jay Robinson in The Robe (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in Emperor Caligula (1983) are far more persuasive and believable with the latter being the most nuanced. Relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. As it is they are little more than cyphers. One example is the role of Macro played by Guido Mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role but is mostly left in the background. The only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. These two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium however. ,negative
 This show demonstrates the depths to which UK TV pre-watershed drama has sunk. With these dull scripts mediocre acting poor plots awful dialog one is forced to watch a DVD of any old ER episode to see excellent hospital drama. None of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to actually act! If you want low quality but easy to absorb soap opera style TV this is the show for you. Personally I like something with more meat on the bone. Sadly as with all other UK licence payers I'm funding this dross. ,negative
 There's an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie - it's just a brainless comedy don't take it seriously. Chillax dude!!! Well that's one point of view. The other would be - why are we accepting exactly the same script the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these comedies . What you get is a slacker who through some totally unreal circumstances has to change his life (always a he) overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more money/self-esteem. On the way somebody does something gross but very illogical. This means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like you won't believe it maaann. This guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative brownies. Then he shines his shoes with it . Hilarious. Most of the usual names turn up. David Spade and Rob Schneider do unfunny shtick but they're crrrazzeee characters - a Russian and I'm holding my sides a waiter in a vegan restaurant. Adam Sandler the king of the brainless unfunny illogical comedy co-produces and some talentless nobody called Dante shows up yet again. The US will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy Dante is famous for cos we are clueless. Allen Covert plays a 36 year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me. He was 42 and looked years older. Did I laugh? Yes but no more than I would at a TV sit-com and I don't have to pay a penny to watch them. Please stop making these movies. ,negative
 [Warning contains spoilers] I felt no sympathy for any of the characters incl the main one who gets over the death of his girl friend v.quickly (but it's OK as he shacks up with an ex prostitute from the casino he works at). The main character is portrayed as this wonderful intelligent writer who gets drawn into a web of deception all the while there is running his monologue of the book he is writing. I can't say I would buy the book a much better premise perhaps would have been if the voice-over (which annoyingly cuts in to narrate any bit of the film that you might not have understood via his book) would've had 52 different personailties... to represent each card in the deck but I digress. In the end there was a twist whereby the main character has been setup by someone close to him but as I disliked his character so much by this point (I found it impossible to like anyone in this film the characters are all one dimensional zombies) that I really didn't care and was glad the film was over. Plus points: The English actress from ER doing a dodgy south african accent Minus points: An irritating film ,negative
 I rented this movie because Elijah Wood has done some good work and I thought this might be an overlooked treasure. It was not a treasure. I don't know if this was straight to video but it should have been straight to the dump. Elijah Wood fans will like the fact that he appears shirtless in a much-too-brief shower scene. But no sane person would like this script. Imagine Memento played by teen actors but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible. Case in point: Janeane Garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently `keeping the chain of mediocrity alive'). As if false memories syndromes and mind-over-matter medicine weren't hokey enough the movie also hinges on one of those unexplained psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience baffled. This same twin bond creates a few too many contrived love scenes between Wood's character and the girl from She's All That who plays the saintly sister of Wood's angry cancer-victim friend. Adding to the triteness of this screenplay Wood's other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and Kidney a young black boy afflicted with a mysterious kidney disease. Kidney's dying wish comes true when Dr. Garofalo gives him his own Walkman. This character's hackneyed function in the story is matched by his on-again off-again relationship to walking. Usually bound to a wheelchair Kidney has several inexplicable scenes showing him pushing others around in it. Kindey's characterization may be one small detail but it is indicative of this film's many other flaws. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is definitely bumbling but it never flies. ,negative
 I found this on the shelf and swooned with joy !! I danced up to the counter slapped down my money and ran home! You know what?! I fell asleep less then half way thru! Tried again the next day...YAWN!! What the heck !?!! I could NOT watch it! I love all the other stuff he's done (I didn't see the one with the monster in it yet). What gives? Is it me? Or him? So sad. Boo hoo. P.S I did like the camera work. ,negative
 Again like many other TV Shows a certain actor/actresses in thrust into the limelight in this case Miranda Cosgrove having built up her reputation in previous Movies/Series (especially by Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider. She is now the star of the show gets to sing the soundtrack ( which she DID NOT WRITE and thus gets even more fame from that). Wonderful? It creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other co-stars especially Nathan Kress who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode except iDont Want to Fight. Cosgrove's music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song (which was not written by her) and other covers such as About You Now and Stay my Baby. Let's not forget that she lip sync/sings her song live too. Is that how you create vocalist nowadays? Back to the show Cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini Hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out. Bras and seen in many cases (though not of the other actresses). Wedgies are mentioned panties have been mentioned once. Og let us not forget Oh My God a come phrase (are any of the scriptwriters/actors Christian?) Granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids I'm surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female undergarment especially in the first episode where the phrase pointy boobs were mentioned. I'm not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at home/in school afterwards. It's not that I'm against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments (which girls will wear) but for a show from Nickelodeon the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff. I doubt that other Nickelodeon shows have such content in them. As mentioned is other reviews the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts--for example when the character Sam cries how on earth is that a time to laugh? It distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence. As mentioned Cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from Cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single vs Cosgrove's covers). As noted the third co-star Nathan Kress is the least noted of the lot. He is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology. His height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his character's crush on Carly/Cosgrove. Beyond that Kress isn't breaking into the music industry and as Cosgrove's fame grows with each episode Kress falls behind. I would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors. The content of the show is of course fictional but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times (thus the laughter track is used).It also contains several continuity errors (how can your father be and Air Force Colonel on a submarine? US Special Forces have their own branches and the Air Force doesn't use US submarines--that is for SEALs). A unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy. Once again it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments exposure of skin and over used laughter tracks. It is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songs/actions are excessive supported by her fans leaving her co Stars behind. ,negative
 I preface by stating I am a big fan of JJL and NOT one of Patrick. Therefore I watched this to see her performance and of course it was excellent. I do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re: shot angles blocking etc. If the director was trying to give it a realistic feel they failed and lost some good performances because of it. Nearly always felt that the camera was way too static too far from intense facial reactions -- and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters the dialog was slow and plodding. This easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle. But the impression I got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times and the energy coming from the actors was... used up. ,negative
 Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one: he's co-screenwriter producer and director of this cartoonish epic about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the Earth. Potentially exciting story fails to take off despite an eclectic cast. Varied players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. Good for a few stray laughs but Allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong solid adventure and campy nonsense. Later a popular TV series. ** from **** ,negative
 I have to admit I picked this movie just for the cast and while Sutherland Scacchi and Prochnow were - as usual - great performers the rest of the movie was such a let down. It feels like it was put together by a team of adolescents with low level scripts that is scripts lacking any depth awful photography and editing and hilariously lousy score! I can't believe I was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end... the sad thing is this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. All the potential was there to make it a hit; that is two main ingredients are there: a great story of national conspiracies and a great core cast (even though many other actors are pretty much soap opera quality). But maybe I'm missing something; until then it's still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion. ,negative
 I tried watching this movie but I didn't make it past the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment considering the cast but I can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors pretending to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has 1/6th of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries I don't think it would have been hard for the film-makers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the part. And I don't say so because of some blind patriotism but because it's absolutely and totally absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian/Pakistani. Now some people say that 'as long as she's convincing who cares?' but my point is exactly that she's NOT convincing and never can be - not due to her acting skills but due to her ethnicity. For example however good an actor Tom Hanks may be he'll never be able to play an Australian Aborigine! But that is still minor to the biggest faux pas the film-makers made: having the dialogue in English. It totally destroys the mood as well as any semblance of authenticity. Had the same movie been made in native languages (Hindi Urdu Punjabi) with English subtitles this may have been an excellent movie. Unfortunately as things stand I would not recommend anyone seeing it apart from film students who want to study What not to do in movies. ,negative
 No one expects the Star Trek movies to be high art but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately this movie had a muddled implausible plot that just left me cringing - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. Even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can't save this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk Spock and McCoy at Yosemite. I would say this movie is not worth a rental and hardly worth watching however for the True Fan who needs to see all the movies renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie. ,negative
 Although many Billie Dove fans are delighted with her work here I have to pass. As a socially prominent member of the British smart set her British accent is basically non-existent and her line readings sound just like well line readings and her emoting seems trance-like and ponderous. Basil Rathbone usually a fine actor seems off-kilter throughout and also speaks with a weird sort-of-accent - in his case something like Italian though we cannot be sure. The script manages to keep his precise ethnicity a secret. He is further hampered by the script which gives him one of those old movie diseases something to do with nerves which requires surgery. The only real entertainment is provided by the illustrious Kay Francis sporting a lacquered bob with side curls in her role as a depraved countess who shamelessly devours men including Rathbone and then spits them out. She pulls it off with her unique aplomb. She is the only living thing in this dead sea of a film. ,negative
 Too fractured to be enjoyable too loose to be interesting and too clumsily photographed to be tolerable MR LONELY is an interesting idea ruined by really bad film making. Like a Ken Russell film at its worst or DAY OF THE LOCUST remade by amateurs MR LONELY might have seemed like a good idea on a few scraps of paper (no script you see) and a free holiday to somewhere but in the end we have a widescreen film that seems as if it was made by film students whose parents told them that EVERYTHING they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I get the film maker right? MR LONELY is a waste of resources trying to be (gawd!) quirky and deliberately off kilter. It ends up being annoying and indulgent.. and pointless. What's the point of going to a commune in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this film about Hollywood delusion. Maybe Korine wanted to remake GODSPELL ... well the result is GOD-AWFUL. Oh and there is some subplot like leftover footage from FITZCARRALDO including Werner Herzog nuns and a plane. Add slo-mo drifting and violin music all wistful and melancholy add James Fox who seems to hope he might be seen as daring (like in PERFORMANCE) and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen. It might have been fun to film but the result on the screen is a mess. Imagine American PIE BAND CAMP with food poisoning. ,negative
 Being a huge fan of Conte d'ete ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/ ) I was expecting to be wowed by another French beach romance with a lot of honesty realism and humor. Same director same actress- what could go wrong? Unfortunately Pauline a la plange is a huge disappointment. It's very slow and talkative which would be fine if the dialog conveyed insights into the characters was meaningful or original. But it comes across as a typical soap opera alternating between irrelevant pillow talk and jealous accusations. The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least character change with regards to Pauline. The source material is standard fare (sexual awakening during a beach vacation) but it could have been a decent film nevertheless if any of the characters were sufficiently interesting. Unfortunately that's not the case. Event though there are other shortcomings with Rohmer's season cycle most of his later films are definitely leagues above this one. ,negative
 Few videos in recent history have been as amateurishly produced as this one -- at least none that have been released by such a reputable distributor. Every frame of this film is a plaguerism of better films of the past. The word 'cliche' is given new meaning by a talentless writer/director who should reserve his imagination for lesser masturbatory efforts that don't victimize film viewers. Assisting in the amateur night 'horror' effort is a number of less than capable technicians who contribute poor cinematography and laughable make-up and special effects. Unfortunately the one or two of the amateur actors in the film who display a hint of talent that will go unnoticed due to the reputation that this atrocity will produce. ,negative
 Don't get me wrong. I've got a considerable soft spot for the works of Charles Band both as producer and director. But you've got to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name to Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys sticks a pseudonym on anything. As a bit of bad-movie fun Head Of The Family is rather lacking although it is better acted than you might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a definite talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies. J.W. Perra is also quite funny as the titular monster though for such a superintelligent being he does get hoodwinked quite easily. Y'know I'm nitpicking because the rest of the movie is so sharp and witty of course.... And having a lead character called Lance Bogan? Nice one guys. We didn't know you Americans knew that piece of slang! ,negative
 If you are home on a weekend very bored and lack the will to move with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next couple of hours you could enjoy making fun of this movie. The acting and script and general movie making of this film isn't actually all that bad which is why it makes it possible to actually sit through this. This is defitnly a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of pre-marital sex. Or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very lame music - that 'rock' band Brian Austin Green is in is really terrible I think thats a much greater threat to society than unwed parents. ,negative
 I really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons -- the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works (e.g. Linda Grant's When I lived in modern times)usually from the Israeli side of the fence. Also a bloke I like told me he thought it was the best film he'd seen all year so with such a recommendation... HOWEVER I actually found myself nodding off at points! Admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but I found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters. Once I'd got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes I went with it but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film. I liked the concept of a restrained almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments - the sexy girl the red balloon and the ninja Muslim fighter. But personally i think the film has been over hyped. I'm not saying narrative and plot is everything (it's definitely not) but even a little more dialogue would have helped. ,negative
 Congo is another multi-milion dollar adaptation of Crichton's works. Like Jurassic Park The Lost World Sphere etc the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence. I'll make this short and to the point. The scenery is beautiful. The actors well it's the best they can do. The script? Try congesting hundreds of pages into an hour and half movie. You get a mess in the end but how neat of a mess is what counts and Congo falls somewhere below that. There were some silly moments like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava? And Amy raised by humans surrounded by humans yet can intimidate dozens of killer apes around her? What sort of twist of common sense is that? Which brings me to this. If there was an annoying character in every movie Amy ranks of one here. You see Amy is this naive little female ape who can talk with a special backpack and harness strapped to her. Neat idea but it gets annoying after awhile hearing her talk. Congo is worthwhile to see and not deplorable but certainly not a memorable film either. ,negative
 Ron Howard and his editors only had one job to do... Follow the guidelines of the book which was rich mysterious moving and highly cinematic in its approach! What they did? They changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What is left is something that has no right being called Angels & Daemons ! I really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way! I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself for this film. I really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made it is pointless....... ,negative
 Red Sonja is flawed weak and lacking. Even the camp-ness isn't good. There are only two good things about Red Sonja ; The costumes (even though the Red Sonja costume is ridiculous. It's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men because she was raped still choose to wear so few little clothes even when it rains.) and the music by Ennio Morricone. Still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable. The story is extremely simple and they didn't even bother to make it interesting. The story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways. The movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely. Brigitte Nielsen is an horrible leading lady. I don't know who's accent is worse; Hers or Arnie's and on top of that; She can't act. There is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was somewhat good in his role but my God he looked horrible he changed so much since his (only well known) role in Raiders of the Lost Ark . Maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991? And by the way what was with all those Raiders of the Lost Ark actors in this movie? Next to Ronald Lacey Pat Roach Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow appeared in a role it seemed like some kind of Raiders of the Lost Ark reunion. The only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the (sword)fights even though some of them are needless and weak. Only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy-genre. 4/10 ,negative
 Admittedly I watched the MST3K version of this but it's not actually too bad outright at least compared to others which deserve my cinematic hatred. The story centers around a troubled girl wrongly sent to a reform school called Girls' Town. Along way races redemption and wackiness (unintentional) happen. The story and acting are a little flat as is the action. However the entire thing is actually entertaining to a degree if you are absolutely bored. Overall just a simple sub par 50's flick but far from the worst movie ever made with some bright spots in the movie (The Ave Maria sequence was good for me). If you get a chance to watch the MST3K version you won't be disappointed. By it self not so much but I can think of worse methods of torture ( Spiker anyone?). ,negative
 This movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What it tries to show you is only ONE side of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children which this movie does not show. Indian Parents are culpable for the following: a. Destroying the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age. Such children grow up to be Adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds. Since everything has been provided to them by their great Indian parents They children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parents. B. I can show you so many Indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adults. The reason why they do is the same selfishness. Indian parents expect their children to take care of them when they grow old. They do no savings for themselves and once they reach the age of 50...They cry out LOUD......We have grown old now and so we are dependent on you children since we have done the GREAT SERVICE of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weak. Most of the Indian parents at the age of 50 have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure. Most feel that they ABSOLUTELY have no need to take care of themselves since they expect their kids to take care of them. In the west the opposite of that happens. People start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they retire they are financially secure. Indian parents do NOTHING of that sort since like I said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at that?. I am a victim of my Indian parents (i am sure there are countless other Indian kids like me) who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on THEIR OWN and they continue to have pestering 50 year olds who cry out loud for HELP all the time. This movie shows only ONE side of the story.....UTTER piece of JUNK ,negative
 Visitors is a hard hard movie to enjoy. It's so slow and leaden in it's pacing that at times I was drifting off during the film. This was about 11AM on a hot sunny day I might add not midnight on a cold winter evening so you get an idea of just how slow this movie is. Strange thing is it's not long. At 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf that I'd quite happily watched the day before. It just drags an awful lot enough for you to lose interest. When it's not mistaking S-L-O-O-W development for atmosphere Visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen. While the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round out Radha Mitchell's boats-woman the hauntings/aliens/whatever are actually quite creepy and effective especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night. Full marks for not splurging make-up all over the shop too. The single person boat is a creepy place and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you. Still though I find it hard to recommend Visitors. I came out of it not only feeling like I'd just watched a 4 hour film not a 100 minute one but also feeling like I'd been cheated somehow as while offering many explanations as to the hauntings (Mind games? Real ghosts? Space aliens?) Visitors doesn't pick one for definite. All that watching Radha Mitchell talk to her cat and Dominic Purcell smoulder for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past for nothing?. Say what you like about Shyamalan but at least he tells you what happened however crazy/stupid you might think it. If you don't watch a lot of these movies your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat but I found this slow boring and highly derivative. If you want to scare yourself silly there are much better places to do it if you want a clever thriller there are many that are smarter. ,negative
 That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious star power of Bela Lugusi Vampira Tor Johnson Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. The special effects which took place in someone's bathtub further doom this film to the dung heap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady Cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the Castle De Sade doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. No wonder talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion which is where this film should find its deplorable end. ,negative
 The plot involves a new hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin's barbershop. So he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such. Sounds real exciting huh. As for the rest of the film a lot of it involves the same material from the first film. The people that work at Calvin's stand around talk loud and mouth off to each other and the customers. Once again Cedric the Entertainer was mildly funny but it is more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie. And Calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money. He's already shown that he will do the right thing in the end. FINAL VERDICT: Nothing new. I don't recommend it unless you thought the first Barbershop was the best thing since sliced bread. ,negative
 The film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity. Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? It looks like the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not a lot) of nudity of the local stars together with slang which otherwise in the nowadays Portuguese society is repulsed with horror. If you watch advertising for Portuguese films at Portuguese TVs they all have included a hot scene from the movie. I'm not saying by any means that Portuguese society is alienated; just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success. Going back to the movie... There is nothing left from the spirit of the book which is a masterpiece. The film could have been a good one had there been emphasized the real idea of the book (of actuality at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients... but the chef was awful... ,negative
 Last night I am sitting in my TV room beer in hand bowl of pretzels on the TV tray & I decide to put the movie Monster Man into my trusty VCR. Expecting a fun-filled gory crash & bash cheesefest of a movie. What do I get instead? One of THE most silly stupid unfrightening & predictable films I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. And what's even worse all during the(& I use this next phrase loosely) sex scene the girl keeps all her clothes on! I'll make this summary short & sweet: mix Dude Where's My Car (about a good 1/2 of the film) with a very watered down Hitcher add a redneck version of the antagonist from I Madman as the primary villain & finally some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo & you'll kind of get a clue how rotten this movie is. It's also utterly predictable throughout. The only notable factor to this buddy movie disguised as a horror film is that some of the moments between the 2 guys (even though the hero is one MAJOR annoying geek & the other is a Jack Black clone) are kind of funny (just mediocre funny i.e..like most of SNL skits). Other than that Monster Man is a monster mess! 3/10 (This one I'll be handing out at Halloween time-just hope after the person views it I don't get my house egged or worse) ,negative
 Oh Gawd. I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. It is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.I just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view. The weird storyline shows cranky vaudeville trouper Grace Hayes bulldozing her blowsy way into a college where her rat-bag son is rich college clown. She's gonna fix his playboy ways no matter what.Her real life son (weird looking) Peter Hays plays her screen son. His real life wife plays her secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect this talent package was almost the raison d'etre for Monogram financing this back-lot musical produced by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire Sam Katzman. As with other Monogram musicals it just looks more like a reason to film recent new furniture purchases and light fittings in order to show off to other studios that Monogram Pictures are 'lavish' in their B grade ways. Have a ghastly look at SWING PARADE OF 1946 for genuine evidence of this: they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it. Story? None. Anyway ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where was Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed them? Probably standing at the boom gate of PRC Pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there. Junior jive hepster Roland Dupree springs to life to rappety tap his teen legs around two wobbly dance numbers especially in the 'big show' finale set in the new and expanded malt shoppe/club set. The usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall and the stage set of mis matched drapery even has one dark main rag that is yanked back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one. The chorus girls and their very plain looking partners in this finale just look like Monogram office staff borrowed (from typing and carpentry) for the morning of filming. They have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on screen... ALL the girls look like they are all called Joyce. There is even a costume calamity where they wear frilly hot-pants...on one leg only. It is all so awful and crummy...and actually annoying when one more tweak up by all concerned would result in ZIS being actually FUN. The one strangely interesting thing is the dialog delivery between Grace and her son/daughter in law: it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the script and logic. She has a very life like presence which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling. The Dupree kid is the real star. He can actually do something...in spite of looking like a tubby Liberace tap dancing teen... You read that right. ,negative
 When I say worse I mean less entertaining. Todd Sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last Zombie Bloodbath which makes the movie even less tolerable. In the last movie there were no special camera effects where in this one we are treated to shaky cam and constant switching to black and white. Also this is called Zombie Bloodbath despite the fact that the zombies are barely in this one. The movie starts in 1945 where some satanists kill a violent burglar and put him up as a scarecrow. Back in modern time some kids have a car problem and go to a house the same house in which the satanist murder happened. Some mean people try to rape the kids (or something) and they bring the scarecrow burglar back to life who comes back with some zombies and now talks like Darth Vader. Mr. Sheets amped up the language and lessened the violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is check this out! My rating: BOMB/****. 96 mins. Not rated contains violence and language. ,negative
 Circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed each better the film features a very gifted cast that mostly perform well however it totally loses the audience basically everyone is back stabbing everyone else and not back stabbing them at the same time because they are backstabbing someone else and working with .... did i lose you? well the film is even more confusing clearly written by a first timer writer it has some redeeming qualities though in the acting especially Famke Janssen shines as Lily but sadly gets a lot of USELESS screen time just standing there doing nothing.....the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the accents sometimes irritating but its still worth watching if you're a fan of any of the actors especially John and Famke who get the most screen time just remember to watch it with a notebook so you can write down who is double crossing who every second.... ,negative
 OK here is the deal. I love action movies and generally have no problem suspending a great deal of disbelief over plot holes or other implausible actions. However this movie went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous. Let me get this straight. The police send a notorious gangster and cop killer (along with a number of other prisoners) on a bus with a grand total of two guards. They then are forced to stop at a precinct where precisely two cops are working one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out. Apparently the building was about to be shut down so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the entire precinct got the night off for new year's eve. Right. But wait it gets better. Gabriel Byrne shows up to take out Fishburne before he can rat him and other dirty cops out. (although we never find out anything about their relationship or dealings). Interestingly the cops launching the assault on the precinct are in full SWAT gear with night vision goggles assault rifles the whole nine yards. Later on they even bring in a helicopter with MORE people in full gear. I'm not a cop but I'm pretty sure you can't just waltz out of the station with an entire swat platoon worth of equipment without someone asking what you are doing. And the police helicopter??? In the supposedly terrible winter storm??? Also no one near the precinct happens to hear or see this major siege going on with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire going off? I mean seriously come on. I know this is set in Detroit but even there it would raise suspicion on a supposedly top secret mission. I also love the fact that they find a Tommy Gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable. I could live with some of these problems if there weren't other glaring issues also. For one the opening couple minutes of the movie are shot nicely in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and I thought was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was wrong. The remainder of the film has no sense of pacing or tension or drama. The characters don't relate to each other in any way which is probably largely due to the fact that they aren't particularly interesting. There isn't enough interesting action to make this a good action movie and there isn't enough character development/storytelling to make this a passable thriller/drama. The relationship between Hawke/Fishburn is the only thing that the director even tries to make interesting or intense. Oh and by the way the final scene in the wilderness? Uh I thought this was in the middle of a run down industrial section of Detroit and suddenly we are in the woods?? The acting isn't terrible in this movie it is just that the directing and writing are atrocious. I really enjoy some of Hawkes Fishburne Byrne Dennehy's other movies but this one is terrible. ,negative
 Ridiculous nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly superficially and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés about Tuscany and Italy divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow Tuscan lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?) which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever and therefore quite worth a look. ,negative
 A real insult to the original Spoorloos which is one of the most genuinely disturbing films (and I intend this as a compliment!) I have seen in the last years. Where the original is chilling and brilliant the remake is flat and even boring especially the happy end finale takes away what little suspense there was in this film in the first place. While such a distortion (especially grafting a happy end which wasn't there previously) is quite frequently the case in Hollywood remakes of European art-house movies and could've been expected the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this inane mess was created by the very same filmmaker who did the original Spoorloos ... Why Mr. Sluizer decided to ruin his masterpiece in such a fashion is beyond me. Avoid this abomination at all cost as it might spoil the original for you even if watched *after* that let alone the other way round... ,negative
 This movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. Scenes where Father Merrin is tossing in his bed and his glimpses of a gimpy native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. The lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to explode soon from all the crazy happenings. There was in fact nothing in the movie to make that line relevant. From the terrible job the movie had done I would have never known that there were any tensions in the village. If you are into cheesy movies go ahead and rent this but if you want to see this done right check out Exorcist:The Beginning ,negative
 The cookie-cutter gets to work overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story. The plot such as it is has been done before a trillion times so there is no need to recount any of it. Suffice to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make a face. Even the soundtrack is awful! Its not that I dislike figure skating although I don't its that I dislike cliched bad movies. ,negative
 When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry. It completely blew in my opinion. I didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell let's see. I'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong. My guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff oh noes what is happening oh its a dream oh its not a dream oh wait i see something spooky oh never mind -sucky storyline. Those sequels don't even require the box to be opened or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead. The first 3 hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place. Nothing fantasy nothing weird the box got opened boom they came. Kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it first because of uncle Frank. Then because she had information about the cenobites. This movie at least attempts to stick to all that even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser. No I'm pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series. Now they are remaking 1 and I don't even think I will watch it. Oh who am I kidding I probably will and probably will be disappointed.... again. ,negative
 I bought this movie sight unseen at a sci-fi convention and I got what I deserved for doing something so silly. Simply put this movie is implausible boring and unwatchable. I was so bored and disgusted with the lack of plot development that I turned it off to watch a repeat of Mythbusters. I understand that this was a very low budget move or least it looked like a very low budget move but that does not excuse the horrible acting terrible plot and even worse camera work. It looks like something a group of college students did in between classes and getting drunk. Maybe if the villain wasn't so laughable and the plot was something that actually could happen in real life with respect to law enforcement it might become so bad it's funny. This movie isn't funny it's just bad. ,negative
 At the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner'.. at least where I come from. A bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. Lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. Has one of the weirdest array of costumes I've seen in a film for a while and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. GREAT job on the dubbing too guys(!) Best moment: when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck he just gets out his gun and BANG! Why not do that earlier? It's a mystery. As is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place. I'm still puzzling over that one myself now.. 2/10 ,negative
 Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I hadn't known that I would have staked my life that the director was Brian DePalma . Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot to even the title this screams Depalma DePalma Depalma Unfortunately since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans Hitchcock over the years Russell should have tried emulating a style of his own . Sure an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would have been bizarre with a capital B but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience . Stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market . Oh and Anthony Perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s . Yawn The only thing of any real note to CRIMES OF PASSION is the controversy it caused . I guess the studio were the happiest people to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity but as for the controversial sex scenes ... What controversial sex scenes ? There aren't any and the only controversy I can think of is of China Blue dominating an on duty policeman with a truncheon . Needless to say he didn't come quietly HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA ,negative
 I will admit I didn't pay full attention to everything going on in this film but to be honest I don't think it would have mattered. Basically local councillor Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) persuades the incompetent Mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) of Firecombe to hold a beauty contest to improve the town's image. They face opposition from women's liberationist Augusta Prodworthy (June Whitfield) trying to sabotage the contest but they do have publicity agent Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and Palace Hotel owner Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Soon enough the young beautiful wannabe models show up including Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor) Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon) Dawn Brakes (Goldfinger's Margaret Nolan) Debra (Sally Geeson) and Ida Downs (EastEnders' Wendy Richard). When the girls have cat fights it does draw away regular residents but after quite a while of some plodding not that funny innuendos and William (Jack Douglas) having over-active twitches it does finally reach the competition and it's just afterwards I couldn't be bothered. Also starring Patsy Rowlands as Mildred Bumble Peter Butterworth as Admiral Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dukes David Lodge as Police inspector Angela Grant as Miss Bangor Arnold Ridley as Councillor Pratt Robin Askwith as Larry Patricia Franklin as Rosemary Jimmy Logan as Cecil Gaybody and Dad's Army's Bill Pertwee as Fire brigade chief Charles Hawtrey had obviously quit the Carry Ons but where's Kenneth Williams? I suppose seeing Babs and young beautiful looking Pauline Fowler in bikinis but for comedy value this fails miserably and the overuse of the swanny whistle just gets on your nerves. Pretty poor! ,negative
 Well the movie was no terrible but whomever created the screen play did not do a good job of even creating the essence of unger. This movie was slightly below average and did not tell the story correctly on one of the most interesting persons ever born. I suggest reading the book one of a Kind the real unger story. They left out huge parts of his life. They also at times did not understand the real caractor that he was. The actual facts of his life were at times out of order. And in the end they really did not portray the actual personality that he did have. So please don't watch the movie; read the book. By the way I'm not just some prick who feels you have to stay 100% to the real story but they did not even come close!!! ,negative
 After hearing that some of the people behind the low-budget flicks Terror in Rock'n'Roll Önsjön and It came from outer space... and stuff were involved in making this movie I decided to buy it unseen on DVD. I wish I hadn't. The other movies were funny tongue-in-cheek and kinda stupid. While Kraftverk 3714 is devoid of any humor at all. And it is so god-awful that I'm getting angry just thinking about it. The worst actors possible the worst script possible the worst special effects available. And the most unsexy sex scene ever. Uhhh. And the whole thing goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please do not ever make another movie. ,negative
 Actually there was nothing funny about this monstrosity at all!! This movie was a complete abomination. The absurdities in this movie almost made me want to vomit!! I think that the people responsible for this movie took advantage of their viewing audience. They took a relatively decent series of movies (I did say decent NOT GOOD!!) and totally trashed it by trying to put money in their pockets. The making of Airplane! was a way for Hollywood to make up for this crappy flick. The worst part about it is that either nobody in 1979 realized the asinine events of the movie (such as Concorde's door popping off at some ungodly high altitude or Patroni shooting a flair gun out the window at Mach 2 to avoid a NUCLEAR WARHEAD!?!?!?....what were they thinking???)were totally unrealistic or they just didn't care! I think that it is the latter of the two. The writers and director of this film if you want to call it that really tried to suck the Airport dynasty dry with this crap! ,negative
 I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much. I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army. I still watch the show so it´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future. ,negative
 I don't know why IMDb lists all the Ghoulies films as theatrical releases.. They were all straight to video films. Same with the Puppet Master series. Why hasn't anyone noticed this yet? Right somehow you've stumbled across Ghoulies IV probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from 1993. You looked in the discount section and found this...Look at the back and front covers. What do you expect The Shawshank Redemption? There is no need to review this film so critically. It is the fourth GHOULIES film! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 because... it was 6.50.. I knew it wasn't Kubrick material. And I was right. An unremastered DVD with no extras not even a trailer boasts an uncared-for film. It actually contains the star of the first Ghoulies film Peter Liapis... who really didn't get many 'big' roles apart from those two films. And I don't see why... He's not too bad an actor and is pretty fun. But I guess if you're gonna take a lead role in the Ghoulies films Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his idiot sidekick Bobby Di Cocco who despite having a very small resemblance to Al Pacino (very small) retains none of his acting ability... A complete idiot who's just awkward to watch. Then there's Stacie Randall - obviously a porn star I don't need to look that up. She does look quite sexy though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility which is no easy task for such a film. Then there is the Ghoulies themselves! Who also manage to let us down. Ghoulies III made them start talking mistake no. 1 but Ghoulies IV takes it a step further. Instead of being puppets this time the Ghoulies are in fact KIDS in COSTUMES!!!! The filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers. Also there's only TWO of them and they're not the main highlight of the film as they don't appear in a lot of it. However at times they are MILDLY amusing... And they're not evil this time either. This really is hilariously bad stuff it's amazing that I was actually able to enjoy it. I dunno why... Some of the black humour is actually funny though the script is mostly effortless. Imagine Satan's only threat to you being that he will kill you slowly...painfully... . But at least Full Moon had no involvement this time. Did they? Yeah a very bad and cheaply made film with 0 production value but not so bad as to be in the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2 Lawnmower Man 2 Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III. ,negative
 I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me no one knows it because I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters I was glad! My agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. They later told me that once back in California (we shot in Atlanta) these professionals had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! Even edited down to 90 minutes it's at least twice as long as it needs to be. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming but otherwise -- what a waste of film! ,negative
 I saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and I can only imagine that guy is a shill. The acting of the female lead is actually quite good but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring I could hardly bear to sit through it. This is the very definition of dullness. So far this film is rated as 8 out of 10 on 7 votes. That must mean the director director's girlfriend producer actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a 10. For the rest of you who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story avoid this. This man on the street shall give it a 2 out of 10. FDA note: while this movie can be used as an aide to obtaining a good nights sleep no medicinal value is implied or offered. ,negative
 I can imagine why he'd want to die after starring in this rubbish. The man is incredible but even Sidney Poitier couldn't save this tiresome morality play about racism in the old West. He and Joanna Going are both fantastic in this film: too bad the screenplay co-stars directing and score couldn't match those two. ,negative
 Hadn't really heard too much about this movie so I went and saw it. I realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. And even those people would think this movie moved too slowly. When the movie opens up you see Nicole Kidman going to a nudist camp. Whoa. Shock. That scene the dialouge were all great. And then the movie went downhill. While I respect the vision the filmmaker must have this movie sucked. It was too slow too predictable and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great as usual but this movie is not good enough to sit through. It tries to be shocking and abnormal but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors. Don't waste your money even the sex scenes were boring. ,negative
 Unfortunately I went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information I had seen on Fandango. Since I am a sci-fi buff the notion of a movie about UFOs interested me. Instead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical Christian propaganda flick. Appropriate for an audience of like-minded individuals but very un-Christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci Code did not hold back its wild-eyed craziness. So this B-grade movie (and I am being kind) production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to Wednesday and Sunday evening youth groups. But if you are a mainline Christian or non-Christian you will not be comfortable. ,negative
 I watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn't bag out that one though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going. The effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movie. I borrowed this one with an open mind i am also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champ) and was hoping it was a decent movie. Boy was i wrong the movie sucked the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary the storyline was SO predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode as i already would guess what will happen the music was so bad with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen. Overall avoid this crappy movie. Save some money. ,negative
 Phoned work sick - watched this in bed and it was so awful I would have went back to work if I could have gotten out of bed. The dog ran off with the remote so I was stuck. I'm positive Hammer was grooming the eldest daughter to become his beeeatch. Horrendous to watch - made me vomit more than what I was doing anyway. So there you have it - this would be the film that they play in the waiting room of Hell before you go in. Or maybe your stuck in the film for all eternity with the Hart kids. Just remember to take a gun with you.... ,negative
 I watched this film on Telly the other night and little did I know what a cringe-fest it would be...I knew it would be stupid but not this bad! This film exemplifies everything that is awful in Australian comedy. Apart from the most tedious uninspired scenarios and characters I have ever come across (aside from those dubious French produced American tax break comedies!) most of the situations were boring unbelievable stereotypical and SO not funny just...terrible! One such scenario that really annoyed me was the nerds on the bus scene. From a screen writing perspective the writers used the most uninteresting - not to mention unbelievable - scenario to get these three stranded without their luggage...They are on the holiday of their lives and they're going to risk it all (including a $300 deposit luggage and room) to exert their rights to dance on a bus? I mean they're about half an hour away from their destination! At least they could have had the bus driver kick them off but no they leave willingly cos 'they can't take it anymore!'and wreck their holiday...Anyway I can't believe the writers didn't workshop this appalling scenario out. I think a ten year old could come up with 5 set-ups more clever funny and believable. I can go on with many others - the really unimaginative stereotypical psychopath the whole relationship with the angry jilted girlfriend and tag along virgin the 'Wow Man! Out there goth girl' inhaling stuff on the train - EVERYTHING was just woeful! I cannot think of one redeeming feature of the this film except that maybe the third wheel nerd was kind of cute. Spoilt his career by appearing in this trash though! ,negative
 This movie was perhaps one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films I've seen in a long long while. To be fair I was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula but I was anticipating to at least be entertained. With such low expectations how could I manage to be disappointed? Jim Carrey possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm) did little more than tread water in this film. He seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his Fletcher Reede from Liar Liar. This new character Dick Harper (a.k.a. Fletcher 2.0) is a poorly rendered and miserably written whelp. If you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character it is most likely because Carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him. Carrey's outlandish posing becomes humorously awkward--and ultimately sad. Tea Leoni as Jane does little more than provide the Abbott to Carrey's Costello. I typically find Tea Leoni refreshing and underused but not in this case. Jane Harper could have been easily played by any actress from age thirty to forty-five and it is in that non-specificity that the character of Jane becomes uninteresting to watch. She simply has no defining trait other than her following of the movie's general theme which seems to be that... Wait no this movie has no theme. Unless you count Big Business Is Evil as a theme. I thought that was more of a given. Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin both deliver believable (though tired) supporting performances but neither man seems truly invested in the role they're playing. It's very clear that Alec Baldwin was putting about as much effort into playing his role as the sinister C.E.O. as he puts into eating a sandwich (which he seems to be doing a lot of lately). Slight tangent but has Alec Baldwin played any roles in the past few years that hasn't required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit? Anyway take my advice if you haven't already witnessed the horror for yourself: save your money. This is the one to catch on HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are present but there's no fun to be had. ,negative
 This should be re-named Everybody Loves Sebastian . The 1983 rural go-nowhere town high school junior (or senior? - they seemed to flip flop on that one) with weird hair and Leo-like good looks has a big plate full of issues. His step-dad announces definite plans to have a sex-change operation upon which his mom calls the marriage quits; Sebastian is called the f word by everyone and their mother all-the-while kissing around with various girls getting high on Ready-Whip at a supermarket and saving a strawberry prostitute from the clutches of her ruthless pimp. Sebastian's buddies make Eddie Haskal look like a choir boy; bad association doesn't get much worse. Sebastian seems to go for Harold's suicide attempts record (although he won't admit suicidal tendanccies). For no apparent reason the genius level SAT scoring Sebastian MUST graduate a year early although he has no clue about the future nor does he want to attend college (what gives with this nonsense?). This film is a look into a few weeks in the life of someone who is PRETTY MESSED UP. The final scene suggests that things will be alright although the HOW is left entirely up to the viewer. The makers of this film seem to bank solely on the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male lead. The story leaves a lot to be desired. Looking for what will this gorgeous kid do next...? doesn't exactly satisfy. The lackluster production values just don't measure up to other films independent or otherwise. A low budget and weak story need more than a pretty face to carry it through. The results of this project are forgettable and an insult to intelligent cinema fans. ,negative
 Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches. My sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces. After every Lnych movie I tell myself again one and a half hour lost of my life. But next time I will check the director's or producers name. So you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time don't watch it. But if you think that you need to kill someone watch it this is probably a better medicine than to spend your whole life in a prison for mentally insane. ,negative
 The not the best movie in the world???? That was an understatement. I personally didn't like this movie at all. Not because of the story line not because of the graphic violence and the nudity. The nudity didn't really need to be in it it did nothing for the story except maybe the girls were going through a rough time and being naked probably messed them up even more. But one of the things in the movie that I hated.. was that it was sooooo dark. You couldn't really make out what was going on. I think if it wasn't as dark and you could see where they were then it might not have been so bad. All you know that its a basement somewhere. You see no house no road the killer in it all you could see was half his face for about 5 seconds. I wanna see some stuff in a movie. It gets boring after 20 mins of pretty much darkness and all you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall. Then you will hear the girl sobbing. There was nothing that really stuck out to me that was good about the movie maybe the suspense in the first 10 mins of the film... but not the suspense of how the movie is going to end but the suspense of.. will I get to see anything in this movie but a few naked bodies and various flashing lights. But honestly people this was a Saw meets Blair Witch Project wannabe. Both top notch movies and both with the correct lighting to figure out what was going on. Forget this movie if you can see.. if your a blind person.. you might wanna rent it to hear the screams if your into that sort of thing. But then again if you are blind your probably not reading this either.. so anyway... BAD MOVIE!!!! ,negative
 While the film has one redeeming feature namely some striking shots e.g. the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree the scene of the funeral procession on the raft or the scene of the boats leaving the village (which seemed influenced by the scene when the warships approach in the fantastic Fellini Satyricon ) these were more photographic than cinematographic and would have been better appreciated hung on a wall in an art gallery than embedded in a painfully slow-paced film that comes in at a whopping 162 minutes and suffers from terrible dialogue extremely poor character development over-acting uninspired symbolism and heavy stylisation. This is the first film I have seen by Angelopoulos and his reputation having preceded him I expected a lot better but can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I won't go out of my way to watch any of the director's other work in the future. The four friends I went to see it with agree. ,negative
 The Bone Collector is set in New York City & starts as one of the world's foremost criminologist's & crime scene experts Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden quadriplegic. Jump forward four years & Alan (Gary Swanson) & his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped soon after New York cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of Alan. Amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses Rhyme when he is asked to work on the case he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of Lindsay. Having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for Rhyme & the police... Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night & I have to say it's one of the worst big budget post The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & Se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers I have seen in fact it makes Friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on the book by Jeffery Deaver & is so poor on so many levels I hardly know where to begin. For a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. The character's are truly awful & I didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. First we have Lincoln Rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. He is seemingly impressed with Amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance I'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there's Capatin Cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies how exactly did this guy get to be a police Captain? Then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? If they wanted revenge on Rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything I could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves the intended target Rhyme anything else. Also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! How did that happen? I should also mention Amelia who is a terrible character she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason. Besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better We never find out why the killer is using The Bone Collector book as inspiration We never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. It's never explained why a rookie cop like Amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. There is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. Also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? I mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? Logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of New York to choose from? There's some nonsense about a bird that sits on Rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours The Bone Collector is really slow going. There is so much wrong with The Bone Collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. Apparently Angelina Jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting. With a supposed budget of about $48 000 000 The Bone Collector is well made with good production values & that Hollywood gloss about it. I also must add right now that I think Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen I think she is absolutely terrible in this. Denzel Washington just sort of lies there really Queen Latifah is awful & even Michael Rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clichéd & one dimensional character. The Bone Collector has to be one of the worst Hollywood films I have seen in a while I saw it for free on telly last night & I still feel cheated & ripped-off. There are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? Works either way to be honest... ,negative
 I've seen some bad things in my time. A half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud; a head on collision between two cars; a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor; human beings living like animals. But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as The Cat in the Hat. This film is worse than 911 worse than Hitler worse than Vllad the Impaler worse than people who put kittens in microwaves. It is the most disturbing film of all time easy. I used to think it was a joke some elaborate joke and that Mike Myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something. I shudder ,negative
 I have now suffered through Parts The Clonus Horror. To have the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror. The story was about a cloning-central owned by the The man They grow Clones for harvesting organs from the clones later on for the original humans in need of transplants. One clone escapes The government gets angry and kills all involved but the story somehow leaks out anyway. It is Truly Shameful how a movie with potential is destroyed by amateurs such as Fiveson. The only thing he genuinely succeeded in doing was to weave in the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect what makes a human a human and would it be OK to grow clones for organic harvesting? Sadly mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left town until the very end in where a pathetic attempt is made to sum it up. But!! What disturbed me the most was the introducing of new characters lacking actual relevance for the plot. Despite that Fiveson feels the need to kill them off in a bad explosion which only Sir Coleman Francis Himself would be proud of. The setting was interesting. How Fiveson thought that pulling out sheets of plastic and running water over them would make a believable river is beyond me but I guess if you were to compare the setting to Coleman Francis' gray pasty oatmeal of a setting this film would win. Perhaps Coleman has changed what bad movies are for me. 3/10 ,negative
 This movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together. I wouldn't call it a movie it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished illogical stories which are not all that funny. There're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning and they just disappeared from the story. He's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1/2 hours. I left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy. I think this movie is just an extended version of Hitch padded with a lot more characters and dancing. If this is the best movie that this couple has ever made then I'm pretty sure I'm not interested in any of his previous ones. ,negative
 How is this a documentary? Much more like a walking ghost tour one might take in any given Southern city. Quotes were generously dropped throughout without the first effort at identifying the source. George Orwell was the most identified quoter. Documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form. Flat out fraudulent shots depicting period film stock were spliced aside historical film reels with no separation from reality and self-promotion. Film reels which were entirely unrealistic and improbable for the time at hand were dropped in as if trying to ape Blair Witch hoping to drum up a spook house on what would otherwise simply be dead real estate. Is this not in some way a great disrespect to actual victims of TB a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism? The line between actual footage and manufactured self-service is so thin; the drippings of doubt so insignificantly played down; the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored... how could this possibly be listed in my TiVo as documentary? It's a vacation promo and at that it fully succeeds. Hell I'd visit the joint if I could locate it on Google Earth. Not scary said a previous poster. Not too serious either says I. Fascinating story. Flimsy film-making. ,negative
 I'm a big fan of the demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of this one it looks pretty good! You've got Decapitron the puppets and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately the little punk that's doing this project to animate inanimate objects can't act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If they were left out it would probably be cool BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I'd watch that for 2 hours. But instead the puppets role is down played and the whole movie suffered because of it. The mystical Skull guy who created the totem is corny at best and Decapitrons appearance is long awaited short and really quite disappointing. You'd be better off watching the first one again. ,negative
 Always enjoy the Classic Horror films however this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments. This film was made during WW II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world. Bob Steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film. Mantan Moreland (Jeff) gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention. I hate to criticize a film made in 1943 but this is really a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula throughout many films during the 1940's you just might like to watch John doing his best. ,negative
 While I am a long-time Shatner fan (since we used to watch Trek re-runs over the dinner hour in the early '70s) I cannot think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film whether for personal development or business reasons. Did he lose a bet? As a movie fan I like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones. But Shoot or be Shot doesn't have any flair or funny bits unintentional or not. While unrated there were no objectionable scenes (blink or you'll miss it nudity cartoonish gunfire violence with the endless bullet gunfights) so one is led to believe that the producers merely wanted to save the fee required to get the MPAA to rate it. This will make its way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited out. Of the eight people that were in the theatre with us four of them left mid-way muttering statements like This is stupid . Shatner plays an escaped mental patient who has been denied release because he views himself as a screenwriter. The examination board stamps his request INSANE . He runs into a group of Z-grade moviemakers who shoot on video because its 80% cheaper than film and decides to force them to shoot his script at gunpoint. There are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters but for the most part that is the whole movie. If you want to spend 90 minutes on a Shatner art film see Free Enterprise instead it is a much better film. ,negative
 Look at the all the positive user comments of this movie then check to see how often each one posts user comments. They post once. It seems companies are probably paying for services which post junk pro-movie comments on IMDb. This movie was awful. The plot was stupid. The acting was poor. The jokes weren't even funny. The movie included minor nudity from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters. It was clear from the first 15 minutes that movie wasn't funny. There was some slapstick here and there but most of humor was supposed to be derived from the characters talking behind each other's back and spreading rumors. This isn't even done well. Every joke is obvious and you see it coming. The movie is worthy of fast forwarding or better yet not watching. I regret watching this movie and if I could charge the studio and distributor for 1.5 hrs they stole from me I would. ,negative
 This movie had an excellent premise and could have been a fascinating look at racism attitudes to women at work and male female relations in England early last century. However it simply turned into a soppy love story. But what was worse is that the love story was totally unbelievable. The acting was for the most part poor the direction confusing but most of all the screenplay and the story were non-existent. The only thing I liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting. I really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out. ,negative
 First off the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I don't understand how was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. The first time I saw it I just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off. After about the 10th time it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you haven't seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game. Now about the film. This movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid ghost story; however the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely. You begin watching the movie under the assumption alluded by the TV commercials that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children; particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger. The opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film. **(SPOILER)** The movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in the home. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar. The young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. After his family is killed the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as well. As I said this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a two-year-old. This began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well; completely ruining the only children can see illusion set forth by the commercials and opening scene. Regardless of this the movie didn't actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end. In which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie. All of a sudden after being attacked by a swarm of crows the man snaps and tries to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be HIS family; which he killed at the beginning. The whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf. First why was the family's souls trapped in a house? If the director was going for a Ju-On (The Grudge) approach in which the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting stop after the father was captured by the ghosts of his family? If the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them why were they attacking the new family? Here's another one for you. It takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest. This tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie was living on the property for months. During all this time why didn't the ghosts just go kill him? This movie included a lot of clichéd horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. However I'm telling ya this movie still could've pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end. It's like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending. For this movie to have been a success they should've stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning (would've opened the door for possible sequel too). ,negative
 The Women (2008) by Diane English is sadly such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning Candice Bergen Bette Midler Cloris Leachman whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen them and Meg Ryan Jada Pinkett Smith Debra Messing and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at how could the movie be boring predictable embarrassing sloppy and simply bad? It was made by Diane English who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. The movie has been a labor of love for English who had tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with the supporting players Bergen Leechaman Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos funny smart and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand Sex and the City which was released few months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it but next to The Women it was simply brilliant. At least Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we the viewers together with her? The movies like The Women give the whole genre chick flicks a bad name. It is nothing wrong with the genre but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships about dealing with marriage motherhood and proving yourself professionally? These are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to. Why making movies with the lines dialogs and situations so clichéd predictable not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over? After I saw the new movie I checked out from my local library the original The Women and I truly enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago and kept my interest all the way. The old movie had a real star power. ,negative
 boring horrible piece of Italian euro-trash about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time guzzling beer(this is what makes him American right? Our scientists spend most of their academic life soused out of their minds sure. That's where all the really great theories come from) who's studying something(dolphin calls fish migration patterns who knows). He hears a weird sound through his headphones proving that his radio is picking up a station in Jamaica. At the same time a Jack Skellington girl with one of the worst most bleached manes of bad 80's hair that it has ever been my pleasure to witness is trying to calm down the dolphins in the Seaquarium she works at as they're apparently upset about the amount of fish she's been doling out lately. The beginning of the film was a really badly colored storyline about two annoying very Italian people who's boat is attacked by something unseen under the water. The whiny woman is never seen again(best part of the story) and the guys' corpse is found with no legs. The dim alcoholic scientist(who has an inexplicable English- American- Italian accent) and the stick girl with the hay hair begin to theorize that there's some kind of giant monster lurking under the seas off the coast of Italy...err..Florida. They enlist the help of an electrician to set up an underwater mike so that the monster can sing karaoke. This guy has a beautiful girlfriend who's only drawback is that she pronounces Peter Pey-tah but for some reason he's sexually drawn to the anatomical skeleton with the frizzly hair a situation that leaves one blinking. The dubbing is awful the editor a spaz and the storyline generally a yawn. There's a bit about how this weird scientific corporation genetically engineered this monster giant shark-squid-barracuda thing for some reason that makes no sense and a really unpleasant greasy haired guy goes around killing women again for no apparent reason. A stupid sheriff and his bulked up deputy are along for the ride along with a female scientist(who we know is smart because she wears huge glasses). At one time the woman scientist takes on the huge terrible monster(yeah right Ed Wood's giant octopus was more believable) with only a small handaxe and she wins the contest. Hooray for skinny little women who obviously make the best monster hunters! The solution to the problem of the giant thing is to blow up half of the Everglades leaving a dead zone for several miles in every direction. To Hell with ecology and the environment right? We have to kill this giant monster! At the end the electrician and his broomstick love ride off into the sunset on her Vespa which is o.k. since she's gotten over her colleagues' death and he's not very upset that his girlfriend got whacked by the crazy guy with the greasy hair. Hooray for true love! Wait a minute isn't there something fishy about all this... ,negative
 I have just watched this latest version of Macbeth and was pleasantly surprised with the solid acting and obvious effort that had to turn a low budget historical piece into a fully fledged watchable movie. One note however the music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the film and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of samplers as opposed to a full orchestral score. I think Paul Farrer needs to get his act together!!! ,negative
 Why did they unleash this movie upon us? It seems as though they set out to make this movie a total slap in theface to Anne Rice and every self respecting Vampire Chronicles fan. It ignores the ground work laid down by Interview with the Vampire mutilates the plot of the novel and has Stuart Townsend stumbling around drunk. Stuart is NOT our Lestat! Our brat prince our adventurous rebel with the damndest sense of humor. Stuart IS a second rate boring rip off of Dracula in black leather. He DID NOT read the books or know the character...is he illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and still he made a point to read the books and know and love Lestat. Don't kid yourselves it is not a Stand Alone vampire flick it's trash plain and simple. ,negative
 NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of The Ten Commandments and The Greatest Story Ever Told and instead they chose to make some halfhearted cartoon that was more like Waterworld than anything else. I don't recall a Bible passage where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark nor do I remember one where Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange nor do I remember Noah being some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting nautical terms like hoist the mainstay! This was possibly the worst marketing decision in history. Obviously the majority of people watching this were going to be Jewish and Christian parents with their kids so why on earth make the movie so offensive to those people? If they were intentionally trying to offend why not advertise it that way and at least reel in the right audience?? I hope they make a REAL Noah movie someday one done seriously and thoughtfully one that actually appeals to people and makes money. Until then don't waste your time with this trash. ,negative
 My mother told me not to go to see Kadosh -- but who ever listens to one's mother? I was so turned off by it while I was watching I thought I must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater so I checked with card-carrying feminists the next day. No they also thought it was much more an anti-Orthodox screed than a pro-feminist statement painting the Orthodox as equal to the Taliban. While this Israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultra-Orthodox Messianists it is so nasty as to be unbelievable (plus that the non-fanatic Orthodox rock-'n'-roller(!) one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy--even in Israel that must be fantasy). The theater was quite crowded so there's a pent-up curiosity to see Israeli movies; too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution. This was almost enough to drive me back to insipid Hollywood romantic movies. (originally written 4/29/2000) ,negative
 Days of Heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films I have ever seen. In no way shape or form would I recommend it to anyone...unless you're trying to put your kids to sleep or God forbid give someone an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do one thing I would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters. Why? Days of Heaven's plot is simple but extremely vague. Long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film. The characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with. The climax of the story does not touch you: by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone. The only things working are your eyes and unfortunately your ears who must listen to the sound of Linda the little girl in the story who talks like a man. I am now dumber for seeing this movie. Don't let it happen to you. ,negative
 This movie is really bad. The hero can't play. You see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart. And believe me he walks a lot. For 45 min nothing happens. He only walks to places and gets out..... Like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring looks-like-a-suspens scenes. Dialogues are very poor. I counted around a lots of hello's and few hang on on the 1st part. Blood is orange like the Mercurochrome you put on kid's blisters. And scenes are not following themselves. A bloody neck on a scene a clean neck on the following. The story could have been improved. Yeah I mean what the hell is the story? Martial arts? Where? Is that martial arts? Watch how hesitant and slow are the moves!!!!! If giving a kick and receiving a punch is called martial arts then I am Bruce Lee!!!! The only good point I have found is on fight scenes : They don't play with zoom and fast switching scenes that gives you headache in most of action movies. There are plenty of low budget movies that are great. That one was just to make money. Nothing else. ,negative
 This movie was very disappointing in that several elements of the book were wrongly done. The main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the movie. 1) Boobie Miles gets injured in the beginning of the story in a preseason game at Texas Tech. This means he won't get anything done during the season at all and Chris Comer comes up sooner on the team. 2) The game against Marshall was lost at Marshall. The team depicted as Marshall was actually Midland High one of Permian's main rivals and here is the proof- Marshall High is the Mavericks colored Scarlet and Silver Midland High is the Bulldogs colored Purple and Gold. Look at the jerseys and you will see who it is. Also the real Marshall High's football roster is overwhelmingly Black the team shown was racially mixed like Midland High. 3) Permian only loses to Midland Lee by one point in district play. Midland Lee loses to Midland High and Midland High loses to Permian. These are the teams that set up the coin toss as such. 4) Boobie comes back on the team as a reserve to Chris Comer and after not getting any playing time in the Midland Lee game he quits the team completely at half time and never stands on the sideline or goes to any games again. 5) Brian Chavez was a Tight End and Defensive End who wore #85 not a Tight End and Strong Safety. In addition Boobie wore #35 and Ivory Christian wore #62. 6) The coaches end up liking Chris Comer as a player more than Boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more straight up plays the way the staff prefers him too this is in part why Boobie quits the team. 7) Dallas Carter is played in Austin at Darrell K. Royal Memorial stadium where UT plays in the state semi-finals not the state finals. Carter wins the state title but is forced to forfeit due to an ineligible player. The acting is done pretty well but if you read the book you will see these flaws are pretty true. I am also tired of hearing all the PC hypocrites out there complain about the depiction of Dallas Carter's football team. The team according to the book is as large monstrous talented and black as the movie shows. People say it is a racist depiction but reading the book you see a true depiction of the team. The story is very altered giving this movie a score of 3.5/10. ,negative
 Graduation Day is a result of the success of Friday the 13th. Both of those films are about creative bloody murders rather than suspense. If you enjoy that type of film I'd recommend Graduation Day. If not I wouldn't. There's nothing new here just the same old killings. Even though I've given the film a 4 out of 10 I will say that it's not a repulsive film. It is watchable if your curious about it just not creative. ,negative
 The theatrics and the drama included in the movie is fantastic but the facts and the research is far from solid. When quoting Dr. Bovon where the documentary tries to establish a connection to Mary Magdalene from Mariamene Dr. Bovon later clarifies it should be used for literary purposes (ie: fables of that time) not for a historical figure. In fact he states he does NOT believe the Mariamene ossuary in Talpiot is Mary Magdalene. He further comments on his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary but rather for information regarding Acts of Philip (a literary work in the 4th century). So what we have here is a director that took one clip for a 4th century Acts of Philip fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st century ossuary inscription. A very sad stretch and Dr. Bovon calls the Jesus/Mary Magdalene connection as science fiction -- as this documentary should be rightly labeled. ,negative
 This is unique in films of Hitchcock's that I've seen in that I didn't really enjoy it. In fact I actually found this quite predictable and annoying. Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newly married couple. He's the kind of lovable rogue character that you've seen in many films without ever being lovable as far as I am concerned! In fact it was a barely believable relationship at best and at times seemed particularly false and implausible. Unable to hold down a job and trying to live an opulent lifestyle Grant is led to borrow money that he cannot pay back. Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is insured for; and presumably what her late father was worth. Average and rather uninteresting all round actually but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date. ,negative
 Okay you have: Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) She's killed off in the first scene - that's right folks; this show has no backbone! Peter O'Toole as Ol' Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor. Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (Brit spelling not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. It's alright they have Col. Cricket's full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes 'round for Christmas!) Still she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!) David McCallum as said toy-boy equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. Pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus. and finally: Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls' Boarding-School serving tea in her office with a dash of deep poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: I've only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful but somehow not part of the real world. Well we can't say they didn't warn us. Ah Susan - time was your character would have been running the whole show. They don't write 'em like that any more. Our loss not yours. So - with a cast and setting like this you have the re-makings of Brideshead Revisited right? Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!) First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - hey it's just the sunlight! Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying her eyes are moist. That's the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is dewy-eyed. Henceforth Leading Lady shall be known as L.L. Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love. Still I'll give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?) And lastly fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is Mrs. She's either Miss or Lady. When all was said and done I still couldn't tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldn't even tell you what was said and done. To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all. OK at the end L.L. finds she's lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (there's always a meanwhile ) some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when I don't know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHE's going to find him there.) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be whisked away SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!) Great drama. ,negative
 I picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to. My first thoughts were that I have never been more ashamed to be an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this movie to be down right appalling. Please don't waste your time. As for the music there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope that I have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is. Yes it may highlight how evil people in power especially when it comes to religion may be but to sit down and watch almost 2 hours of this movie can make almost anyone gag. If your up for a good Indian movie watch something by director Mira Nair. ,negative
 Ring! Ring! Have-been horror directors hotline how may we help you? UmyeahPronto! I mean hello my name is Rugge err call me by my initials R.D! Okay Mr. R.D what seems to be the problem? Well the reviews on my latest movie Dial: Help were all negative and harsh and frankly I myself feel like my career has seen better days as well. Okay Mr. R.D and why do you suppose that is? Well I gained fame and a well-deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and another one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park for which I borrowed the idea from Wes Craven but Dial: Help revolves on  err never mind! No no Mr. R.D go ahead and tell me what the film is about. Um it's about a spiritually possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her. Ah I see. That premise does indeed sound a little silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists but I suppose there are deeper themes in your film right? Oh yeah sure Um what do you mean by that? Well isn't the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror? Or perhaps it's all just happening in the mind of your female heroine? Um nope It's just about a phone going berserk and murdering people with the cord vibrations electricity or even ordinary coins. Interesting Mr. R.D but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie? You see I figured the slowly unraveling phone-mystery plot wouldn't be that important or relevant so I just concentrated on processing all possible phone-gimmicks I could think of. Phone gimmicks? What do you mean? You know like wind blowing through the horn mind-penetrating dial tones and turn-tables catapulting into the air! Very original Mr. R.D but not exactly horrific and as an experienced director you must know that in the end people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events. Oh but there is! It all has to do with negative and unreleased energy if I remember correctly! It's all a bit fuzzy I admit. Hmm I see. Oh well as they always say a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story. Did you at least process some of your regular trademarks into the film so that your fans at least recognize your style? I tried! Lord knows I tried but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking anyone! That's a pity indeed Mr. R.D but what about sex? Everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril! Yes but  But what Mr. R.D? Well to tell you the truth we kind of promoted Dial: Help as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of Charlotte Lewis on the cover but in reality there's no sex in the film and Charlotte even refused to go topless. Mr. R.D! Now I'm really disappointed that's just shamelessly ripping people off and lure them with false promises! I know I know and I'm ashamed but I just wanted everybody to rent Dial: Help and love it! Well to round up I can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few erroneous decisions without it affecting his/her career immediately but be more cautious next time and do some research first okay Mr. R.D? I will; thank you! You're welcome. Tell me have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already? Yeah as a matter a fact I do! I was thinking about making a Giallo with a murderous washing machine! Doesn't that sound fascinating? Hello? Hello? ,negative
 Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jane Austen's works has been portrayed. Perhaps I am too severe on this adaptation but I'm afraid I am biased to the A&E version. I have a hard time imagining Mr. Darcy portrayed by anyone other than Colin Firth. The characters seemed shallow and often dialogue forced. Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. Her fancy for Wickham was overplayed and then her sudden like for Darcy was not believable. Darcy was portrayed tolerably well I will grant him. He managed to maintain the aloofness that is required but I felt he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that makes his character so delightful especially in the proposal scene. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were also played well but seemed lacking in many ways. The mean temper of Mrs. Bennet was not completely captured in her performance. Mr. Collins' was a good portrayal. Very much in line with the book. I will refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst portrayal in the entire film. Other problems I saw were the few liberties they took with the order of events such as Darcy being present at the first meeting with Lady C. and also that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy on her visit to the Collins'. The choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes. The scene where Lizzy and Darcy dance loses much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look akward on the ballroom floor. At least this BBC version left out the dialogue between Lizzy Darcy and Sir William when he commends the two on their dancing as they performed very ill indeed. There were occasional moments that it kept me interested but overall I find this version to be a disappointment. I would not advise this film unless you're like me and you are excessively diverted by such follies. ,negative
 I find it almost touching how Star Trek fans try desperately to like this film in spite of its unbelievable number of flaws. To begin with none of the familiar characters are really in character so to speak. Scotty is depicted as a bumbling tinkerer instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series. Uhura...Gods I can't even think about what they did to her character. All of her dialog was painful to listen to. McCoy seemed like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock...well let's just say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted. He was given bad dialog ( I do not believe you have grasped the gravity of your situation Captain. Gravity get it? Get it?) and made almost into a buffoon. Kirk...oh man don't get me started. William Shatner is a hammy actor to begin with so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we got. The plot is beyond ridiculous. Giving Spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap operaish. But hey let's go with it. The search for God. Again a weak plot basis. You don't think so? OK let's go with that too. So assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound what's wrong with the script? Well for one thing it recycles way too much. The Enterprise for example is yet again not working properly. Are we to assume that Starfleet would send a grossly malfunctioning ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation? If that's the case then why not put him on a better ship as an adviser? Adding to that...the crew is grossly incompetent. Scotty has the ship in pieces (and apparently is cloddish enough to bump his head knocking himself into unconsciousness WHILE there are hostiles on board!) no one seem to notice the Klingon ship decloaking at a crucial moment (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in weapons range) and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other. In other words there is no sense of discipline. If this is the flagship of Starfleet then it's a wonder that the Klingons hadn't already overthrown the Federation. As to the personal struggles with pain it was crap. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor but even he couldn't save this turkey. In short no one could. Of all the people involved I imagine Leonard Nimoy is the most embarrassed by it. I hope he is anyway. Thank god the original cast didn't bow out on this cloddish opus. ,negative
 Every time I by pass this show on TV I absolutely and truthfully want to claw my eyes out and rip my ears off.It's so unbelievably horrible.The jokes aren't funny the acting is completely terrible and the whole entire show is one major disappointment.I hate Charlotte Arnold's guts and I just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time I hear her talk. She is a no talent low IQ big waste on society and I think she would be doing the world a favor if she just shuts the f*ck up and went away for a long time. Please I say this with all my heart DO NOT EVEN WATCH ONE EPISODE OF THIS SHOW!!!!!!It's not even worth 30 minutes of your life and there are thousands of better things to do including killing yourself than watch this show for half an hour. ,negative
 I really wanted to like this film however after an amusing opening few minutes I hardly cracked a smile. I agree there was no chemistry at all between the two leads and the other characters were cliche ridden. The script totally wasted the talents of Bud Tingwell and Kim Gyngell. It must be said however that there was plenty of laughter around me and even a smattering of applause at the end. Perhaps I just couldn't relate to it enough. I'm just glad I went on cheap tickets. ,negative
 The first movie of this series was well written and original. This show drags on poorly written gags boring flashbacks not the comedy that I expected. Even the young folks found it boring. There are certainly bright moments historical elements and some good acting but overall I can only recommend this for DVD/tape at home. ,negative
 The Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the silliest and worst movies of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies but this one is just a sheer waste of one's time.Terrible terrible terrible!I watched this movie last night and it was all I could do to finish watching.I understood that this weird crazy man wanted to capture Bigfoot but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie.It did have some amusing parts though.There was this very cheesy and corny disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to go on for far too long in the movie.I think the director was trying to fill time.The worst thing was the way the Bigfoot looked.The obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur Bigfoot.It was laughable.If you want to see a very bad Bigfoot movie then I suggest that you purchase this movie.Personally I wasted my time and my money on this one! ,negative
 From what I understand Mr. Bava abandoned this project before completion...AND RIGHTFULLY SO!!! If I were him I definitely would have made sure that EVERY copy was burned and if anybody in the future ever asked me about this film...IT NEVER HAPPENED & IT NEVER EXISTED...end of story. Despite some great sets and good photography this is one horrible film...is it supposed to be scary? (not in the least) is it supposed to be funny?? (puh-leese) A total waste of time...and I really don't like to have to say that!! ,negative
 Ramsay  the kings of comedy (or was it horror whatever) wake after years of hibernation. And yes I did get scared. No not because of the horror element (of course I am not that squeamish) but because rats were constantly dancing on my feet in the khatmal-chaap theatre (where else do such movies run). So check the plot. A man is repeatedly stabbed choked to death stuffed in plastic and dumped in a pool. But he still returns to take revenge. Now was the film a thriller or a horror? That itself is the suspense for you to discover. And the end turns out to be another mask mystery. Remember those trademark Ramsay undercover agents  men wearing some stupid horror masks. Only here the mask is of a human. I suppose no more detailing is required to skip this flick. Amarr Upadhyay tends to get over-dramatic and theatrical forgetting the difference between cinema and TV soaps. A cheaply and skimpily dressed Aditi Gowitrikar in her typical pink lipstick looks like .. (Uh! you know what). The background score is a straight lift from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Not a single department of the film whether technical or creative is worth commenting. Novelty lacks both in story and execution. Dhund certainly fogs your senses. ,negative
 A pig-tailed Linnea Quigley drinks milk strips and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after they have sex. She goes to an asylum makes a best friend out of Amy (Karen Russell) and the two blackmail their way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by Carol Burnett Show regular Lyle Waggoner). On the outside these two man-hating mafia princesses (!) stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball ex-boyfriends over to their large country home for a party where they're systematically slaughtered in very gory ways by a gloved leather-clad mystery killer. The hideous David Barton FX are so bloody but so unrealistic that they take on a sort-of surrealistic quality. Same goes for the movie. The dialogue is so strange and stilted the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other-worldly you'll start to doubt your own sanity. This film actually attempts to have a plot and three-dimensional characters but it's all so poorly handled it's almost like what would happen if Ed Wood did a rewrite of an Ingmar Bergman script! And like any good Bergman film this has a mature moral to abide by--Any good party needs a proper guy/girl ratio so there will be enough chicks to tickle your lizard. See it for yourself... or don't! Linnea (the only reason I was even interested in watching this to begin with) is very amusing in this one has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye-popping nude scenes. Unfortunately she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it. Score: 3 out of 10 ,negative
 This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad. I really lost it with those out of the blue not so special effect . Guys If you're an insomniac go with your girl to see this movie. I give it three sleepies! ,negative
 This is one of the best looking films of the past few years. The fact that it was done on a virtual shoestring ($1.8 million or so they say on the DVD:they infer that they ended up with even less financing) makes it all the more impressive. Not simply the photography but the design and particularly the locations (Eastern Montana) which are at once authentically American and otherworldly. Too bad there isn't a coherent movie to go with it. An extremely promising setup of the last 48 hours of clearing out a rural town in 1955 before it will be flooded for a dam is washed away with pretentious mumbo jumbo alluding to angels and a dying child. And what is presented as the real world is hopelessly arch. Note to the Polish Brothers:the Coen Brothers are funny-you are not. No doubt many cineastes will find Northfork 's abundant symbolism and inscrutability as marks of some sort of profundity the sort that sophisticated types wrestle the night away with in coffeehouses while the braindead masses watch Charlie's Angels or something. (Sigh) If you insist.... In the meantime recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its' impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty. ,negative
 Any of Law & Order's CSI (take your choice of city) and Homicide: Life on the Street's weakest episodes is superior to the strongest episode of Bones. David Boreanaz is stuck in crappy Angel mode and Emily Deschanel portrays Bones too... unrealistically. The actors as a whole have terrible scenes together be it with forced acting or just awful lines. The murders become predictable after a while as the foreshadowing and clues are just too obvious. Music is okay though really unnecessary at times. All in all Bones is hardly the show I'd recommend watching during the weekdays as it is a carbon-copy of better shows with unreal characters and ever-dulling stories. Skip this if you can. ,negative
 I just got back from seeing Comedian . It was...alright. It kept me looking at the screen. Its just not the type of thing I like to go pay $7 to see. Now don't get me wrong it'd make a great HBO feature. If this were something I was watching on TV i'd be hooked right in. It gives an amazing look at what comics go through before and after getting on stage. It will interest anyone who likes watching comics. But when I go to the movies I like to be entertained. I'm not there to be educated. Now I know what its like for Jerry Seinfeld before he goes out on stage....great. But truthfully I'd rather just laugh at his jokes than worry about any of that. One more thing: With the bad attitude Onry Adams has; I'd expect to see him taking my order from Burger King before I see his HBO special. He wasn't funny. He's the kind of person that you love to hate. ,negative
 At first sight I must say already watch The Contractor 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and with a more dramatic plot. The Detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb set in Romania and with awful directing for an action movie-- there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom. Really what you expect Wesley Snipes to do when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him? Don't blame him he needs the money. This was the first impression when I saw the movie 3 years ago. But I won't see it again no way. Screw it. It sucks. There. I said it. PS: I don't think I ever said this movie sucks on a IMDb review. Thank you Detonator! ,negative
 The film has so much potential which was not developed. Mark Hamill gives a good performance and so does Bill Paxton. The scenery is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft are neat. The problem with this film is that the story is way underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere. The film at certain points almost puts you to sleep. I give it 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes. ,negative
 Seriously all these Satan comes to Earth movies always involve the Catholics. Why doesn't Lucifer ever mess with the other denominations. The plot is that Asmodeus (Played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a plot to become human (but wasn't he always a demon) by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child. Except maybe she isn't his sister. The plot isn't clear on this and they inter-splice these scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problem. The lead girl gets pregnant while still a virgin with an incredibly creepy scene of her father giving her a gynecological exam to prove her hymen is still intact.... Eeeewwwwww. Her sister (played by a washed up and looking much worse for wear Denise Crosby) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. Praise be! Well the demon baby takes mom's body for a joy ride and picks off in order a truck driver her friend's boyfriend and her friend all being watched by an ex-military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born. We discover that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic Cardinal who is running the whole thing. The ending is pretty much incomprehensible and if you could make it that far straight through you have a stronger stomach than I did. (I paused the film a couple of times it was so awful.) ,negative
 Here's what's good about The Slaughter Rule: --Ryan Gosling Clea Duvall and David Morse all give great performances. Gosling is as always pretty darn outstanding. The locales are often breathtaking. Here's what's bad about The Slaughter Rule: --Everything else. The script is horribly muddled. And while I can certainly appreciate a non- feel good movie this movie is just boring. Great performances can't make-up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw-away lines that often don't even make it sense. Just getting through the first hour became a chore. I stuck with it because of Gosling but eventually I did myself a favor and changed the channel. Spoilers on here relayed the ending to me. I didn't miss much. Do yourself a favor--if you want a good Gosling flick check out The Believer. My score: 2 out of 10. ,negative
 Why does C Thomas Howell do these movies? Cruise (Howell's one time co-star) does a huge blockbuster of WOTW and Howell follows with this lame effort. Where do I start here? Production Values - I'll start with the good stuff. The look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. The set-ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad. Script - Terrible. A series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie. The amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable. Very poor storyline (but so was the Cruise WOTW) takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off. Special FX - Okay I don't want to be too harsh here as I imagine the budget was smaller than Cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done. Some shots are quite impressive - mainly far off destruction shots of bridges Washington liner. But in the main the alien machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful. Also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others. Acting - I'm a fan of Howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the over-acting bug a long time ago. Look at his performance in The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. There is no comparison. He overdoes his facial expressions his flailing arms and legs (where did he get that running style???) and for a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family. Hysterical. But after saying all that - he is still the best actor on show here. Busey is embarrassing to look at and Peter Green (Zed is truly dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. I honestly could not understand one word he said - I even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene - but the DVD did not have subtitles. This seems to be a real keep-it-in-the-family affair too as Howell's son the director's wife and the line producer all make it into the film. None of them are good. Direction - not bad but not good either. Score - Dismal. Overall a lame duck effort that will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. He should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the A list but if he keeps doing stuff like this he won't have a career soon enough. 3/10. ,negative
 I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did. Gary played by Andy Garcia was such an unlikable character that I found it hard to be supportive of him. Andy's acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie. Andie MacDowell did a fine job with her portrayal of Linda Gary's romantic interest. I can not say anything bad about Andie I always enjoy her acting. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andie is so far fetched and unbelievable. The two do not make a good pair on the big screen. The end of the movie was almost as much of a let down as the movie itself. A nod from the Pope and all is forgiven come on. The event that allows this movie to have a some what happy ending and that the writers would expect us to accept it is pathetic. Gary does not change and only by the death of a dear friend does his situation get better. There are tons of great movies that should be seen before this one. Don't waste your time. ,negative
 A party-hardy frat boy's sister is brutally murdered by a street gang sending the young man into a sudden psychotic rampage. He and his buddies massacre half the city to bring his sister back to life. SAVAGE STREETS was released a year after this film and was more entertaining. Linnea Quigley who has a costarring role in this film as the sexy (and briefly nude) girlfriend of one of the guys also starred in SAVAGE STREETS. This film is subpar though it delivers enough escapist entertainment and gratuitous nudity to please its intended audience (me). MPAA: Rated R for strong violence nudity language and some sexuality. ,negative
 Wynorski films are always excreble. This is just another case in point. Out of the five naked women shamelessly flaunted here MAYBE one has real breasts. And that's a strong MAYBE. No humor no gore just boobies boobies boobies. And some tepid softcore lesbo action. But know what? For fifty cents less than this video rental I could have rented legitimate porn. Do I feel cheated? With Wynorski always. So I prepared myself for a letdown as one must always do. ,negative
 This is one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross Peter Elliot Munro and Amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting complex and fast-paced throughout this impressive novel. And about 99.8 percent of that got lost in the film. Seriously the screenplay AND the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not fathom what was good about the novel. I can't fault the actors because frankly they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to Crichton's original work. I know good novels especially those with a science fiction edge are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original. But this may be the absolute worst disparity in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever. The book is really really good. The movie is just dreadful. ,negative
 This movie is awful just awful. Someone bought it for me as a Christmas present because they knew I liked a good horror flick. I don't think they understood the Good part. All I can say is next year this person is getting slipper socks from me. Avoid this movie-- it makes you bitter. Peace. ,negative
 Updating of the Clare Booth Luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment. The cast of women is excellent most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together. There is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. Granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common but at the same time its just as timely as ever I just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really don't feel pulled along by the plot. Wait for Cable. ,negative
 To be honest the movie was SO HORRIBLE that I loved it. Never in my life have a seen such a TERRIBLE movie. I was in shock. I mean i don't even know what to say. The characters couldn't even keep their own guns one minute a guy had an M16 and his friend had an MP5 then in the next scene they switched guns. (Don't ask trust me I know my guns)And i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like Vietnam to an Arizona highway to my backyard and then to a chemical plant in California that is what i took from it. Why would you be afraid of a guy in a Halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic arrows at you? How is that frightening? I wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie. I love how the skeleton man randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day. But hey whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a mound of fire ants. Good day. ,negative
 Leon Errol handles his double role of Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping superbly but I have trouble liking the Mexican Spitfire Series because they all are contrived to produce mistaken identities and these are telegraphed way in advance. Errol is funny as the stuffy Lord Epping but I would have preferred a lot more wit and much less repetition. ,negative
 Matthew Aldrich. This is a name worthy of remembrance. This is the individual that took fingers to keyboard and came up with one of the worst scripts of all time. Cliché. Predictable. An insult to the public's intelligence. Is he the sole beneficiary of blame? Of course not. Renny Harlin took this abysmal excuse for a script and made it into a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris actually read it (or not) and chose to star in it. Culpability abounds. This is the Denise Richards of film scripts. There aren't enough Razzies in the universe to give proper recognition to how truly horrible this writing really is. In all fairness Samuel Jackson's profession is incredibly novel and the manner in which it's presented is highly creative but at the end of the day it's all just trimmings. Pretty trimmings. Package it any way you want- garbage writing is still garbage writing. ,negative
 I'm sorry to say this but I didn't enjoy this movie at all. It was just too boring. So boring that I couldn't watch the rest of it. It's not as interesting as the Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate this stupid days because these days are just not what they used to be. The movies that Disney have released lately really sucks! I miss the old days when they used to produce good movies like the Lion King Aladdin Pocahontas Cinderella The Aristocats and Robin Hood. This movie is really awful. I really tried my best to be interested in this movie but I just couldn't. I don't think I could recommend this film to anyone. I would recommend the ones that I just mention above. ,negative
 The film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour but nothing more. The leftest agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling. So the women are kidnapped and sent to ex Yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because (take a deep breath) the American military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad. You don't need half a brain to see the relevance to Iraq war and Black Water Company. What a load of leftest excrement! Looks like I have been fooled all my life into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of Communism's grip on this region for 45 years. But no it was the American war on Iraq which is also responsible for earthquakes tropical storms and the constipation I had last week. The film ignores the fact that 95% of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the western block. You also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair. We have someone chasing down a woman in the streets of London in broad daylight beat her up then somehow drags her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her. No one sees this or calls the police and the running woman does not care to scream during the chase. Even better we later see 4-5 women lined up in the centre of London in -again- broad daylight to be sold one of them has a smashed face and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening. You can't make this stupidity up. I used to think that such trash was exclusive to Hollywood but apparently I was mistaken. ,negative
 I will not say much about this film because there is not much to say because there is not much there to talk about. The only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from Atlantis: The Lost Empire are back. Several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters it has horrible comedy horrible animation and James Arnold Taylor trying to copy the wonderful one and only Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch. The reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were and never should be animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible and finally why would somebody who did wonderful voice-over work for Obi-Wan Kenobi in Clone Wars want to copy Michael J. Fox? I happen to have an answer to this. Because they are the same person who thought he had to copy Eddie Murphy from Mulan in Mulan II. Yes sadly it is true. . ,negative
 *** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this does contain spoilers I have seen some pretty lame films in my day. And that only stands to reason seeing as I see about 80 films a year. I would have to say that out of those 80 films I see at the theater maybe 5 are really really good 15 or 20 are not that great 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible. Here On Earth falls into a category unto itself. This is one of the most predictable vehement despicable films I have ever seen. It is loaded with unlikable characters maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY. And I am not being unfair. This is an awful film. This is the story of a rich guy a poor girl a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk. Are you getting warm and fuzzy yet? Let me continue. One day the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at. So he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together. What this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see Chris Klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him. He has abs!!! Oh and he is rich!!! And.... he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone. He is James Dean he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn!! He is rude to everyone in town he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat. But Leelee Sobieski still falls for him. There is no reason given as to why she does she just does. Oh pardon me that's right I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does. Well if that doesn't get you wet then I don't know what will. Here On Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever been privy to in film. There was one point when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and I told my fiancée exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes. Upon my return she just laughed and said I was right even when I said that there was going to be a dancing scene. And furthermore the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I have ever seen. Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight they lose their hair their gums begin to rot. It is not a pretty picture. Sobieski glows after she contracts cancer like she is pregnant. What an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease. And how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field? Now I realize I have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times but this is ridiculous. There wasn't one thing to like about this film or the Chris Klein character. He is a jerk he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him. Here On Earth is not only a bad film it is an irresponsible one. This received a 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart and that is way too high. This is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again. 0 out of 10 and that is being generous. This film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film. If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this film choose cleaning the cow manure. It'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours. ,negative
 What a nasty cynical film. Apparently this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20 year olds do whilst crawling through the gutter of Sydney nightlife is supposed to be somehow connecting with its target market. Made by some Industry nobody and pals who seemingly thought they could cobble together any sleazy behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes SAMPLE PEOPLE deservedly failed miserably at the Australian box office. It is so offensive in its clichéd depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended. Shoddy and cruel and with no attempt to offer quality or resonance to the young audience who might have been attracted by the marketing or casting SAMPLE PEOPLE might have been interesting or even informative if not botched by its exploitive view of 'what teens want to see in a movie'. The character played by Ben Mendelsohn is particularly offensive and Kylie Minogue is again wasted by poor material and untalented film makers. It is as if the producers thought teens would watch any ugly trash and just slung-together scenes and characters who were shallow and soul less. Well the were very wrong. A mini budget film made in 1983 called GOING DOWN got this topic right and is an excellent antidote to this poison. ,negative
 This is officially the terrible boring corny and ridiculous movie ever created. The movie is all about a crazy kid and his friends and they land a 747. His dreams are very corny and make no sense at all and is very poorly done. Every special effect looks as if it was done without any modern technology and might have been created by the kid that plays the leading role in the movie. If you watch this movie it will definitely make you stupider. I advise you to never consider watching this movie and if you do good luck and don't miss the brain cells you killed off. My comment does not even fully grasp the awful creation from hell that has been made. The person that wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie that I dreadfully watched and wish I never watched. Peace. ,negative
 This is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen - it has no good features at all. It looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title graphics. The lead male transformed from deaths door to superman - eh you what Other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting. I left the cinema feeling cheated. Needless to say i could not reccoemnd this film to anyone ,negative
 Within the first 5 minutes of this movie I knew I was in for one of those pick at the faults kinda movie. The acting was terrible the script was even worse. Who ever let these people write write such crap for a movie need to be feed the Komodo's themselves. With Russian Mig jets posing as U.S. Air Force jets and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50 - 60 rounds rapid fire without reloading is poor detail to any story. In one scene komodo are killing special forces troops at night while in another they are explaining how the komodos and cobras are cold blooded and don't come out night!!!! Also with fantastic special effects available in today's movie industry they were only average even for this low budget movie. All that being said I did watch it to the end curious as to what other wonders bad film making could produce. Shame Shame Shame for producing such rot!!! This movie should have been left on the cutting room floor!!! ,negative
 Yet another Lo Wei production to completely waste the talents of a young Jackie Chan To Kill With Intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia melodrama supernatural action and plain old-school kung fu fighting that is pretty dull despite featuring several surreal WTF moments and lots of laughably bad dialogue. In an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from the Killer Bees a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) pretends to be a heartless cad driving her away and thus saving her from danger. During the attack Cao's relatives are all killed but he is left relatively unharmed by the gang whose leader a scar-faced woman seems to have the hots for him. Cao then goes in search of Chin Chin whose safety he has entrusted to his close friend Chu Chuk. During his quest to find his true love Cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil 'Bloody Rain' clan. Eventually after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan (a fun scene with lots of silly weaponry) and then nursed back to health by the scar-faced Killer Bee (who shows her love by burning his face!) Cao ultimately learns that he is a lousy judge of character: his friend Chu Chuk is none other than the power hungry head honcho of the 'Bloody Rain' clan who has plans to marry Chin Chin himself. Cue the drawn out climactic battle with Cao getting kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually choking his traitorous ex-pal to death with a scarf. Even die hard Chan fans will find this one a chore to sit through with only the final fight managing to showcase some of the star's amazing acrobatic abilities. Fans of general Asian weirdness might dig the spooky appearance of the Killer Bees at the beginning of the film (with one character inexplicably demanding back his severed hand!) or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero but for most this film will have very limited appeal. ,negative
 This movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in Russia. Epic movie about Russian culture Great saga of Russian spirit endless articles and interviews. For me this movie was the biggest disappointment. The main character played by Oleg Menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his comrades because of a woman who doesn't even look like a lady. What is there to admire? In the first part of the movie the story doesn't develop at all. People's festival scenes look like boasting about Russian audacity. I respect Mr. Mikhalkov for his previous works both as actor and director but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the Tzar of Russian cinema. ,negative
 To put it simply this was a pompous piece of canine poopie. Overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment. After a while i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed-up anal retentive. And this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn't have: all the scenes are in a sort of washed-out blue-steel-greyishness. Hmmm the last time i checked candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors. In fact the light they put out tends to be more in the warmish yellowish-orange range of the spectrum. So where's all the blue-steel-grey light coming from? This movie has fancy sets and glitzy cgi fx but it's still dreck. It's pathetic junk put out for today's movie-goers who are easily placated by pathetic junk. I very much enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices but this was a total hack job. Universal Studios' 1941 The Wolfman is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what could be done nowadays. I'm done with this franchise. The first movie was reasonably decent. The second still somewhat entertaining. But this one i couldn't even finish all the way to the end because it was so boring. ,negative
 The film is a gross misrepresentation of Orthodox lifestyle and practice. NEVER will a Jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place. Childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life but nowhere are they rejected by their community as depicted in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact many great Rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce. The depiction of Yosef a horrible human being is meant to - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox male. In reality it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable. It is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a MOVIE (by someone who is personally biased against a community). I have always thought that it is only the Orthodox because of their narrow-mindedness and insular lifestyle who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers or see in the movies. ,negative
 Three is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie. Masquerading as a psychological thriller it's closest relative is the monumentally superior Dead Calm (also featuring Billy Zane). Dead Calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman's grieving parents attempting to re-define their relationship on an ocean cruise. They end up being terrorised by Zane's adrift psycho-killer. It provided sharp increasingly ratcheted suspense a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded. Three suffers from poorly drawn characterisation (the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them) a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding hammy performances from the principal players. Zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion. In Dead Calm he was menacing wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence. Here he is bombastic petulant slimy and unravelled. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year? Ms Brook is very picturesque stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over-inflated by some sort of life-raft pump. They do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. Dramatic actress in the purest sense of the term she is not. The guy playing the voodoo-hexed Manuel the third component of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - no one would notice. In fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes (excuse pun). Plus sides: the scenery is nice and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible. I'm guessing this had a very limited (if any) theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail DVD. The reason for this is it's not very good. If you want something decent along these lines get Dead Calm. It was made by people who knew a bit about cinema. ,negative
 Wait... wait... wait... wait... wait... wait..... WHAT!? This movie is terrible absolutely terrible. 1. The only reason Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kiefer fans only to have their hearts broken. He kills one guy gets shot and dies before half the movie is over not to mention he was only in the first 10 min and then disappeared until the point which he died...WHY put him on the cover if his character BLOWS. 2. Where are the EPIC battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. It was way too confusing i mean whats up with the girl? She had to narrate the movie to TRY to get our attention she failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in a movie..... it fails. Now I am going to go watch 24..... THIS MOVIE FAILS! ,negative
 One thing I have noticed about British horror movies from the 1970s is that they don`t hold up to repeated viewing THEATRE OF BLOOD is a case in point as are all those Amicus anthology movies . Add THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR to the list Much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end . Once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat film . It does open with a fairly good hook but after that we`re treated to long boring sequences of two old ladies making small talk . Correct me if I`m wrong but how many people watch a horror movie expecting a couple of old ladies making small talk ? The only sort of interest to be found in THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR is the anti-smoking stance . Some people have mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-military film but watch carefully and you`ll see that everytime a squaddie lights up for a fly puff he gets killed . Rather strange considering attitudes to smoking weren`t nearly so hysterical as they are nowadays ,negative
 I don't really mind the creative ideas interjected in these movies but seriously. There isn't one coherent part of the game in this movie. That seems to be the trend buy the rights and then just make a movie that has zero to do with what the fans want. This butchering is almost entertaining because you know you are getting away with hiding behind a lack of skill and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do this. Play a game or hire someone to and please make a real movie or stand in the boxing ring and have your butt handed to you as you so claim won't happen. wow 9 lines of text and i was done. had to add blah to bug you sorry ,negative
 this movie is sooooo bad that it forced me to create an account with IMDb just to warn others about it. i have been using IMDb for a long time and many movies have come close to making me want to register to either praise or bash them however none have ever been that worthy. Until now! I am a huge Matt Dillon fan. all i could ask myself throughout this movie is how did Dillon choose this script ? really. i mean there are holes in it larger than Vredefort. i mean it is a modern day heist movie not one set in the seventies. For crying out loud even a child knows that armored trucks have gps tracking and the sort. makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in Hollywood. i could go on for ages but i wont. believe me when i say this. save yourself the time and give this a skip. Sorry Matt I'm still a fan but this movie sucked. ,negative
 I got this thing off the sci-fi shelf because I remembered seeing the first of the series when I was a kid. I'd rented the second one and it was a decent B sci-fi. This one was out right obnoxious. The special effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done. The two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that I literally cringed every time they came on the screen. The plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. I don't know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but I'm sure that they'd have done better to have left it at 2 movies. The movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible. I only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device. ,negative
 35 years after this was made Castro still reigns. Unfortunately we're left scratching our heads wondering how the dim-witted maniac played by scenery-chewing Jack Palance made it as far as 1960. I stumbled back across this recently and was amused at noticing the incomparable Sid Haig and B movie favorite Paul (Untouchables) Picerni among the rebels. Fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he directed this foolishness. Some of the lines are classic in a Did he really say that kind of way?' The other thing I just noticed is that the score and the sound (NOT the dialog) are actually excellent -- the only first-rate elements of the entire production. So don't watch this to learn anything about history or acting but if you feel like watching this as a goof bring the beers and have some fun. ,negative
 This movie was really bad. First they didn't even follow the facts for it. Half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of Ed Gein's victims. The acting was horrible except for the guy playing Ed Gein but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy. though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos. that was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill. The writer of this movie tried to spice it up but it didn't need to be. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough without falsifying information. ,negative
 Scarlet Dawn casts Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as a Russian baron rudely displaced by the forces of the Russian Revolution and now has to fend for himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats. He's also not terribly suited for any kind of real work. Doug might have been caught by the Reds but for the fact that his former servant Nancy Carroll didn't give him away. Nancy's got a big old crush on Doug and they do marry once arriving in exile in Istanbul which throughout the film is referred to by its former Christian name of Constantinople. They marry and settle down with Doug now reduced to washing dishes. But Fairbanks's former mistress Lilyan Tashman who's always playing bad girls of a sort on film spots him and offers to have him get back into somewhat the style he was once accustomed to as part of a swindle against father and daughter American tourists Guy Kibbee and Sheila Terry. Good thing this film has the incredibly short running time of only 57 minutes usually those were given to B westerns because it's both tedious and melodramatic. The ending is rather unbelievable. Doug knew he was in a Thanksgiving special and really overacts to cover up the defects of a unbelievable story. What I didn't understand was that Fairbanks was trained in the military profession why didn't he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new Soviet Union? That didn't make sense to me at all. I'd only see this if I was a dedicated fan of any the main players. ,negative
 I'm not going to bother mentioning any of the plot - this is strictly a B movie on its way to obscurity. The shock to me though is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film. Erika Eleniak never anything you'd call a thespian anyway seems to have morphed into Anna Nicole Smith (in her Big period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. He's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies but if you like martial arts eminently watchable). Here he is a shell of his former self - sure he's older but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested ... I just don't get it. Don't these people invest? William Forsythe is another heavy that I've always liked but his last several roles are what you would call mailing it in . I'm not going to even mention Mr. Reynolds - his gig here amounts to a throwaway nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff as usual a creepy evil pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk - the best kind! This is a movie you watch for laughs. There's nothing else to it. ,negative
 I'll preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's. I don't own any I've never rented any so I might lack the appreciation for these tongue-in-cheek low-budget stinkers that many other people have. I caught this movie on Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. Please don't ask me why I was watching Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker. Some atrociously bad acting courtesy of Misty Mundae (and I wish she wouldn't own up to being from Illinois as we actually turn out some very bright thespians here) caught our attention. Now normally the aim of some good soft-core porn would be to get you and your partner in the mood. Some good sex tongue in cheek humor and who know what could happen? After about 15 minutes and a scene where the title character seduces a mugging victim my lady friend said 'if you want to watch the rest of this fine I am going to bed so I don't have to. Please turn the volume off.' Here is what I gather from the plot: Misty's character is a sexless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super-sex kitten with super web slinging powers that don't come from her wrists. There is some sort of evil villainess involved who didn't look particularly evil or sexy. Spiderbabe saves the day has sex M.J. (who is male in this film) constantly gets propositioned by stereotypically bad gay bikers and somehow the evil villainess gets pushed off a building to her death. What was good about this film? It ended. What was bad about it? Acting to make a third grade pageant look like Oscar winners a script turned out by people who I picture to be drunken college-aged sex perverts who wouldn't know what sex is if they took a class taught by Dr. Ruth special effects that were about as special as someone jumping off a trampoline humor about as funny as well I have yet to encounter anything that is lamer. The sex scenes? If we were watching a video the only thing those scenes would have turned on is the fast forward button. And the action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games had better choreography. Now I know this type of film is supposed to be enjoyed for it's inherent badness. Companies like EI don't set out to make good movies: they have a niche and they target it. My experience as a marketer tells me they are right on the money in servicing their audience. But after my brief exposure to 'Spiderbabe' I for one can say I am not delving into that world again any time soon. Maybe the problem with the filmmakers in this type of genre is this: they spend so much attention to making the films bad that if they made an effort to try and focus on those things they do very well they would turn out some very enjoyable 'le bad' Cinema a la Troma films in the 80's. Sorry folks; the spirit is there but the effort isn't. Though I have to admit that Alice in Acidland intrigues me ,negative
 For all its many flaws I'm inclined to be charitable towards Thing . There is the nugget of an interesting creepy claustrophobic Hitchcock style story here. Put this in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer British perspective) Robert Bloch or the guy who wrote Day Of The Triffids and you might have had a nasty unsettling little spook story that was the best thing in an book anthology of horror and suspense stories. However someone chose to tell this story as a feature length movie and a cheap 2nd rate at that and so most of the potential is wasted. A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon's to bring out interesting quirks of character in a better light. His classic story The -widget- the -wadget- and Boff is an example of how he can gather together an isolated group of ordinary characters and in the space of 40 pages can turn them into the most amusing sympathetic and fascinating people you've ever met. A good writer can with a few chosen words make the reader see some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to scar his emotions. Instead we get a movie where some of the most irritating and unlikeable characters ever made are lumped together and made to interact in unconvincing Where did that come from?? moments that just lie there. (IE the blond psychic girl declaiming that You're all evil and I hope you are destroyed! ). We get leaden pacing and slow motion blocking and dull sets and stiff actors. I blame the director for the 'stiff and shallow' part. These are all 3rd rank character actors who never made the big time but they are also 'real' actors and a good director could have gotten better performances out of them. We get uncalled for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uneasy and exploited without delivering any kind of payoff. (If I'm going to have my baser instincts exploited and feel guilty about it I want done by stuff staged better than this). And we get over an hour of creepy build-up diffused in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climaxes I've ever seen. Good things about Thing ? Um well...some of the closeup shots of the warlock's head silently mouthing its directives were pretty effective. The miserly and shrewish widow rang true to life (even if I wanted to stuff a sock in her mouth). The first scene where the big simple ranch hand silently turns on the oily cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a fairly sympathetic character. And like I said earlier the idea of an insidious force from the past turning the members of an isolated community against each other is a good one and can sustain interest far above the actual merit of a bad performance. Which this definitely is. But as I said I'm inclined to be charitable because the director was probably working under a penurious budget breakneck time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge facile crap like The Cave Wrong Turn or the remake of House of Wax 40 years from now. I hope they are charitable towards our own tastes in supporting our generations wastes of film stock. ,negative
 ... in search of the cheesiest so bad it's good movie I've repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films only to be left disappointed and bored at the end. Not this time!!! My eyes teared up my belly and my cheeks ached from laughing so hard throughout the movie. Sure Hulk Hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is utterly predictable but everyone dives into this movie knowing all this - all anyone wants to see when renting this is Hogan breaking out a can of whoopass with a bunch of YEAH BROTHER s and WHATCHUGONNADO s flying from his infamously goateed mouth. And while the Hulkster on the screen pales a bit in comparison to the Hulkster in the ring seekers of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this backhand gem of a flick. A laugh riot. ,negative
 Just listen to the Broadway cast album and to the voices of Barbara Harris and John Cullum who do wonders for the wonderful Lerner and Lane score. Then with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind watch the movie with Streisand as Streisand and Yves Montand reading his lines with such a heavy French accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it. The best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what Montand does to the introductory part of the title song. Listen as he sings/says: Could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do? (That one part sums up the problem that results from casting name stars in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.) I can just see Rex Harrison entering that scene and suggesting Montand too could learn to do justice to the beauty of the English language. ,negative
 Boring cliched and predictable. The only original bit was the Brighton location for gangsters. It is certainly no Lock Stock etc....... Hannah was likeable in Sliding Doors . In Circus I developed no empathy with his character and couldn't give a toss what happened to either him or his girlfriend. Although this movie was so cliched and predictable the ending was no surprise I was so uninterested I didn't even care why the movie was given the name Circus ....... Booooring.......Don't visit this big top. ,negative
 This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever seen! The cast is an international one - Australian-pretending-to-be-British stage American and a character with an English name sporting an unrecognizable European accent. What passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity. So short were the shoestrings of this film's budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition. In the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and stalk'n slash thrillers of extraordinary (though not necessarily high ) quality which have been made on no budget at all. Recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary Blair Witch Project and of course - the most recent - that low-budget winner SAW featuring practically unknown leads (Gary Elwes is just someone you don't remember even if you have seen him before). In DARKHUNTERS it is shocking to find a known character actor Dominique Pinon and Hollywood has-been Jeff Fahey struggling valiantly to save the film. It is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man (Fahey) in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines. I would have rated this film 0 out of 10 had that been possible! ,negative
 I rented this film because I enjoy watching things with Lauren Graham in them. Well she was the highlight. Everyone else seemed complete separated from the picture. You kept looking around you at those watching the film with you going what? However she provided some clarity as she was the only normal character in the picture which actually isn't saying much for the film. Personally it was too far fetched for me. However I am glad I rented despite the fact I would never want to own it. I still feel that Lauren Graham proved to be a strong actress and even thought she was not the main character she seemed to steal the movie. My husband and I were happier and cared more about her character ending up with Josh's character than we were about the two main characters. ,negative
 An evil spirit takes over a girl and diffuses panic in the Louvre museum that's all I think the summary of the movie and the movie itself ! Which I think it's one of the worst French or non French movies ever made in the history of cinema ! Nothing good in here except the music (of the credits only !) some tender moments of (Sophie Marceau) and of course the movie's finale shot.. Not because it ends ages of what seemed to be a countless years we had in watching THAT CRAP but also for being so perfect as one magical C.G.I work that was too good to be true in here ! By the way I want to change the plot summary to be like this An evil spirit takes over some cinema artists to make lousy movies .. Just like this one for sure. ,negative
 In terms of historical accuracy this is the absolute worst Roman film I have ever seen. The list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three-hour film but just to give you an idea... Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats taking the side of the people against the nobles. This is patently absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. Their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war. There had been reformers notably the Gracchi brothers who lived about 100 years earlier and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens. There are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous if you know anything about the period. Cleopatra with Richard Burton will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded fanciful though it is. Historical accuracy is one thing. Acting and dialogue are something else and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production. I burst out laughing several times especially when Julia the daughter of Augustus meets a lover. They clutch passionately as she breathes: My father... Ah your father your father.... your father would disapprove. Peter O'Toole is at his worst forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines. The actor who plays Augustus as a young man is such a nebbish --- and the character is written as such --- it's impossible to envision him as the cunning crafty Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here he's just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time. Charlotte Rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as Livia Augustus's wife with dignity. Had she been given a fuller role to play she might have rescued this production from absurdity. There is some nice photography and battle footage helped by plenty of standard issue CGI. Oddly this was made for British TV (and appears to be a British-Italian co-production) but is labeled with an R rating. The DVD picture is excellent and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice although you only notice it during the few action sequences as the movie is mostly talk. Almost any Roman movie even Cleopatra or The Fall of the Roman Empire has more historicity --- to say nothing of compelling drama --- than this bizarre Classics Illustrated Jr. adaptation. This one gives new meaning to the much-abused phrase Based on a true story. In this case they could have said Suggested by real events.  ,negative
 Badly shot badly edited clumsy dialogue flat characters unsuccessful adaption of a novel. It doesn't really get much worse. Decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. Occasional good one-liners. David is a dim-witted young man who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a Chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a debt-collectors gang where every member has an IQ below sea level. A lacking script along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt-collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show. David rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher Haraldur who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces David he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. A severely lacking script doesn't offer David anything to base his opinion on. A couple of scenes SHOWING Haraldur doing something that David could have misinterpreted would have done the work. The potentials of film as media as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on are not exploited. At first David's connection with Haraldur raises his status within the debt-collectors gang but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. The plot of the film is fine but then it is based on the book. This could have been a much better film. A good screenwriter could have made something of this material. Sadly that is not the case. The acting is generally good. Pétur Jóhann is excellent and credible as David. Eggert Þorleifsson doesn't get much to work with but does his best with what little material he has. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a tiny role) manage alright. Overall opinion: What could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim-witted anti-hero in a debt-collectors gang becomes a boring badly-crafted film made after a poor manuscript. Staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable. ,negative
 Although I'm not too much of a religious person I still had relatively high hopes for this movie as it does have the amazing Steve Carrell and its prequel Bruce Almighty was actually a creative and clever Christian-themed comedy. However Evan Almighty comes nowhere near this originality and freshness that the original has and can't decide whether it's a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values. If it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on it could have lived up to its potential but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor cheesy dialogue and motifs that attempt to give the movie profundity but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience and also a very confused and clouded presentation of the movie's opaque message. It was very obvious that Evan Almighty was very poorly written there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense. For example although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet swarm to Evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood is their inclusion really necessary when the only flood that happens in the movie is downtown Washington D.C. and a suburban neighborhood meaning they are at no risk of being wiped out? The filmmakers it seems lacked the originality to modernize the Bible story whatsoever and instead just had it take place in a present time without changing anything to the plot leaving many elements that just don't add up such as this and make it obvious of the idiotic motifs and writing within the movie. Overall this work is tragic in that the acting talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes isn't exhibited because of the bland characters they portray and that it was so poorly written that it skews and clouts many of the film's attempted themes and makes a mockery of the first film. Finally Evan Almighty also is an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any halfway-intelligent moviegoer in that it fails both of them miserably. ,negative
 Man oh man this was a piece of dog sh#t. I read a few reviews on here after seeing the case in the local video store and thought to myself........ Ah this seems like a half decent movie.Vampires.Swords. Thailand.How can you go wrong? Right? No no no way f*cking wrong. Jesus if only I could gouge out my eyes and not remember this film I would be happy. The lead actor had THE whiniest gayest voice ever.Man!It really was bad.... Amandaaaaaaaa.... I gotta save my girlfriend.... F*ck off! My buddy and I actually changed the Audio Track on the DVD to Portugese just so we didn't have to hear the guy's voice. Subtitles and all...and this IMPROVED the film. I'm serious if your anything like me and wondered what this film was like..STOP WONDERING. I have the answer. WORST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER! No good action no good gore and only the smallest smattering of nudity. Just pure sh*t for 90 Mins. Don't rent this buy it think about it or watch it at 3:00am. It just doesn't cut the cake......at all....in any way. F*ck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You'd have a better time. I'm sure. ,negative
 It is beyond me why two million Danish people each week sit down to watch this terrible show. The dialogue is terrible and not realistic. The characters are hollow and simplistic. There's a tough man a tough woman and a sensitive man. The writers actually say that they have modeled the characters after Greek mythology! Give me a break! All the characters are of course brilliant policemen. When I have watched this show I have longed for District Hill Street and NYPD Blue . These are brilliant shows and Rejseholdet is a lousy copy. This program is a symptom of the disease Danish television is currently suffering from. ,negative
 Okay first of all I missed like the first 15 minutes of the movie so I missed credits and stuff. SO when I finally got to it I was like Who the hell is this dude? . I found out it was Flex like hours after watching the movie. Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson. Not one bit. He couldn't dance like him or move like him the only thing he almost had was the voice. People commented on Elizabeth Taylor but I can't really comment on that because I don't know much about her. The whole movie was like just plain wack. The dialogue sucked. The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked. The soundtrack sucked. The acting sucked. Yes even Flex...I'm so upset about it though. I didn't want it to suck. I'm so sad that Flex got told he can get away with it. But the whole thing looked like dress-up. You know? It's like nobody looked like they were supposed to except for Joseph Jackson. The concert sequences just sucked. I'm sorry but Flex just can't dance like Michael. I mean like what the hell was VH1 thinking? The makeup didn't even match like the time of whatever Michael was going through. For example in the movie he was still dark when Neverland got raided the first time around. In real life MJ was white as hell. There was some sort of stupid delay in his skin discoloring. The movie wasn't boring well for me it wasn't. It wasn't really anything. I was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it. I wanted to see how it turned out and if Flex could redeem himself. He didn't really. The only part I found like a bit interesting was the whole Lisa Marie thing. When they fell in love. That was nice. But I had to turn my face away when they kissed. Heh. And only two parts made me collapse with laughter. The first time was when they cut from Michael with short hair you know the Thriller era to Michael with long flowing hair from the Dangerous era AND HE WAS STILL BLACK! That was funny. The second time I laughed was when they showed all of the posters and memorabilia of Michael but they had Flex's face instead! It was so funny. Overall this movie was cheap trash. It was simply two hours of dress-up and could have been so much better. But no VH1 is cheap. Watch if you want. But this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it. I came out of it feeling angry. And when I found out it was Flex I just started to feel so bad. So...watch if you want. ,negative
 This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the Russian Revolution wrong - after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. In fact the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now back to our story. Here we have the revolution being rumored in Russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman Baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He flees his home with his former servant girl Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) in tow and they start to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution the Baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl not out of any real passion but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. The revolution doesn't change this and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot. Once in Constantinople Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer and that is when he meets up with his former lover Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha Vera's plan does not include her. This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little she is given to do but that is not much. Lilyan Tashman is the standout here even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland. ,negative
 Apart from some quite stunning scenery this Steven Seagal vehicle is devoid of reasons to spend any time watching it. For a Seagal movie it has very little (almost no) action but he does put in some reasonable (for him) acting in contrived character development scenes. Not recommended. To anyone. ,negative
 There is a lot wrong with this movie. It can be said that doing a sequel to Halloween was a bad idea in the first place and we should feel lucky that the previous entries even at their lowest were still watchable. But even still Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers -- even today -- is so bad it's shocking. Poor movie-making at it's worst indeed. There is so much blame to go around. But where to begin? Whose shoulders does this blame rest on? Was it director Joe Chapelle's style-over-substance directing? Well at the very least the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front. And as far the visual effects go you get to see Michael kill in some pretty gruesome ways even if it doesn't quite fit in with the overall tone of the series. So could Daniel Ferrands' troubled script be the culprit? Well to be fair he did the best he could. By the time you reach the sixth entry in any series you're running out of places to go. Finding a rhyme to Michael's reason isn't a bad concept so much as it's an uninteresting one especially the way it's handled here. And it really doesn't help that the movie was hacked to pieces and sewn back together so many times that the story got completely lost towards the end. Perhaps Dimension/Miramax could have botched the whole thing. Afterall this was the first studio film in the Halloween series and we all know what happens when too many cooks get in the kitchen. Heck look at the unbelievable lows they dragged Hellraiser to? I guess everyone is to blame because aside from the actors and the visual effects guys it seems nobody put in the effort to deliver a decent flick. The bottom line though is that no matter how you cut it slice it dice it or electrocute it until it's head explodes Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers was never a good film. Marking an all-time low for the series that nearly killed off any credibility for Michael Myers Curse is just that: cursed. The thorn angle was never interesting nor was it probably expanded upon. The needless gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the Halloween name. Towards the end the movie stops making sense stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and end the film before anything else is lost. It's sad that Donald Pleasence's final performance is immortalized in this film even if the man did the best he could under the worst possible conditions. And for the most part there's other strong cast-members in this film. Paul Rudd plays the weird anti-social adult Tommy Doyle rather naturally while Marianne Hagan does a fair job at portraying the sympathetic female lead. On the other side of the coin the re-casting of Jamie Lloyd was a shame and thank God Devin Gardner doesn't do movies anymore. As the child in the film being pursued by the Man in Black Danny is the anti-Jamie in that he is annoying whiny and absolutely unbelievable in his role. It's sad when you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror film. But I guess that's Halloween 6 in a nutshell. Essentially this is the anti- Halloween made by a director who didn't know what he was doing and a studio that had their own agenda. Hell even the music is bad. Many will try to paint this as the edgy- Halloween because of it's sci-fi twist but really it's just stupid. Save for some good visuals and decent characters The Curse Of Michael Myers is just about as bad as it gets. And this is coming from a fan! ,negative
 This is a movie about people receiving a love letter. Nobody knows who sent in and nobody knows who it is for. A good cast headed up by Kate Capshaw Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. This however is a completely dopey plot. As an example the Capshaw character one of the leading citizens of a small town in New England takes up with an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck the town firefighter who is crazy about her. If that isn't the epitome of stupidity I don't know what is. Just an example of how dopey this movie is. Watching Kate Capshaw jog is a pleasure but you immediately realize that she has never jogged a day in her life. Another obviously dopey part of a dopey movie. ,negative
 The people who bash this movie were looking for it to be as cool and slick as the first one which this isn't. This movie was supposed to be the complete opposite as Ocean's 11. This has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12 while it did lack a gripping plot is being bashed because it was different then what people wanted. If it were released before Ocean's 11 it would be taken much differently not as a failed sequel. The problem with sequels is people go into it with a preset idea of what it should be like it and have lots of expectations. They should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be Ocean's 11 again . ,negative
 Yes bad acting isn't only one thing to mention. Bad script not so bad music. Unfortunately. Nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too. First thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea to have some fun !!! Smiling ... They find everything in the sea. I mean things like fishing-net knife scuba dive things ropes bottles husband ... Woodoo stuff are you kidding. Stupid. They are so happy on the island they are going to die and they are happy. Love peace. Love. Just stupid. Terrible skip this one please. ,negative
 There are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is. What I wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small. The Manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge. Virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for electromagnetic separators. If there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both. The first sustained nuclear reactor was fired up under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate students wielding axes as a scram mechanism. It's a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. The other thing I really disliked was the huge moral debate over if we should continue the project after Germany surrenders. Okay we have thousands of (mostly) men who worked for years to make a really big boom. Does anyone think they didn't want to see it work? There was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device but it was not that serious clearly not the huge debate this film makes it out to be. ,negative
 This home movie is basically scandalously rubbish but you have to give them 3/10 for trying. The blood is rubbish but the granny that kills them is quite funny and I think the concept is good and make-up is OK for a home movie. However thank god it was only 55 minutes long and the twist at the end is quite literally Fight Club (as in almost as trash as the film). Just read this comment don't watch the film. ,negative
 I don't leave IMDb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. I fast forwarded through most of it stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene only to continue with the fast forwards. Formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted there was only the one left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene it felt as though I'd already read the script before because there were no surprises no mystery. The Tori character... bad bad acting. A true waste of time on DVD and a definite 'let's go to bed early' option if it's the only thing on television. If you watch this film you will find yourself realising you'll never be able to get back the time you've just wasted. ,negative
 A trash classic! Basically what we have here is a story about a couple of American teenagers (one male one female both beautiful people of course) who seem to be psychically linked in that every time both of them fall asleep they can inhabit each others dreams and express each others innermost desires... think Mills & Boon meets X-files and you'll be somewhere near the mark. Actually its more like an unhappy hybrid between one of Ed Wood's famously bad B- movies and a particularly silly episode of Melrose Place so tacky are the special-effects and so amateurish is the acting. The actors who inhabit (I wouldn't say act in) this flick say their lines like they're reading from cue cards and pout when they're supposed to be showing an emotion and it comes as no great shock (or loss to the industry) that they have since faded into obscurity. The whole thing is just a laughably misguided mixture of styles that don't go together at all and the end result is a intriguing curiosity that no doubt will be lapped up by purveyors of so-bad-they're-good films in years to come. I'll probably be the only person who ever comments on this film but if you are reading and have seen it please get back it gets kinda lonely round here... ,negative
 House of the Damned (also known as Spectre ) is one of your low budget haunted house horror flicks filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects. It is about a family that inherits an old Irish mansion and after moving in begin to experience strange phenomenon and ghostly apparitions including the ghost of a young girl who was murdered and buried within a wall in the mansion's basement. The couple's young daughter is then whisked away into some other dimension and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help. The ideas this film borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film Poltergeist are obvious. I will say that this movie does have some slightly creepy sequences but it is sometimes very very boring. The acting here is nothing special the mood is alright the score (which was mostly this dramatic Irish opera music) was somewhat annoying and the CGI special effects are really horrible. I mean it was 1996 you would think they could have done a little better than they did. The ending where the house was on fire was the poorest special effect I've seen very very cheap. But hey this was a cheap movie. Also the translucent monster wolf thing that their daughter sees looks horribly fake. And what was it's significance in the film anyway? What the heck does a wolf-monster have to do with a haunted house? The special effects in here are what really ruined this movie. The acting was pretty bad too. I usually enjoy many low budget horror films but not this one. House of the Damned is nothing special at all only consider watching it if you have nothing better to do. But you'll probably want to pass on it. 4/10. ,negative
 I'm a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes into this remake I started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasn't. The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. Two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister-excuse me while I barf. The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesn't make sense considering the situation he's in. If the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid found he's about to die and that he's accused of a crime. There is a reason for where the sex scene is at. Early in the movie Dexter isn't living life to the fullest so he's not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. I still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been lovers. One of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet NOBODY AT THE CARNIVAL NOTICES!!! Also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on. If you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds. Not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits. I would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but I don't want to put a spoiler in my post. ,negative
 I am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to 'Gone with the Wind' should EVER have been undertaken. Having expressed that I have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. The performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. The hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility. I think it will go down as one of the misguided films of Hollywood. I don't believe that the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film-making. The sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe. ,negative
 This movie is a fine example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie out of the gates at all cost. Only with this movie it truly is a near miss. Everything seems in place for Robocop 2 to be a worthy followup to the groundbreaking first movie. The complete original cast (apart from the casualties naturally) returns and gives it their best. Too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as neutralize their efforts. Irvin Kershner might have been the ideal go to guy for George Lucas to direct the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner there isn't much to ruin in Lucas' charmless film series. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have needed either Paul Verhoeven to return or a director with enough brass to give his own spin on it. Kershner doesn't know how to give his own spin on anything (Lucas hired him for that) and he's surely no Verhoeven. So what we get here is a movie that goes through all the motions to replicate the first movie but with none of the freshness humor or daring the original had. Kershner probably thought he could top Verhoeven by adding more gore and gratuitous violence but instead he reveals how much he was at work as a director for hire instead of a passionate filmmaker. And that's a shame since everything was in place to make this another classic. As mentioned the actors give it their best but Phill Tippet delivers some groundbreaking stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story by Frank Miller who was born to write a Robocop movie. If only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential come through. ,negative
 I concur with the other users comment. Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's. I think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up. If anyone can truly say this is a good movie they need to be locked up. It is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. I feel I lost intelligence from watching this. I used to have a little respect for Chuck Norris before I watched this but now I just feel bad. I bought this as part of a 3 movie pack for $9.99 and I can honestly say I would have been better off literally throwing the money away. Forgive me Jesus. ,negative
 This oddity contains Bunuel-like touches but doesn't sustain one's interest. A 10 year old roams a bizarro America in a stolen Mustang while the usual cult movie suspects (Dick Miller Mary Woronov Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS the screenwriter delights in making you squirm. I remained unaffected due to the broad acting. You know you're in for it when Meat Loaf and Flea give the most appealing perfs. (And what did this kid's screen test look like? He's insufferable.) Recommended to the dozen or so fans of SONNY BOY ('87). ,negative
 Glen or Glenda was Edward D. Wood Jr's first attempt at directing a feature film. For this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart...transvestism the art of a man wanting to dress in women's clothes. To his credit Wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately Wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film. The story opens with a prologue by Bela Lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite Glen/Glenda (Daniel Davis aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell) tries to understand why a man would want to live (and die) this way. Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores Fuller) and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession. And that's it. We see endless stock footage shots of anything from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach interspersed with shots of Wood walking down the same street dressed as either Glen or Glenda and looking longingly at women's clothes in a store window. Poor old Bela who was down on his luck and befriended by Wood keeps popping in throughout the story. I'm not 100% sure but I think Bela's scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completed. To add to the confusion of Lugosi's narration Farrell as Dr. Alton also provides off screen narration. Lugosi keeps saying bevare bevare...take care take care as well as some gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy dog's tails. The story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and Wood's character(s). The dream sequences are laughable. A wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example. Wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors(?) fully clothed but leaving little to the imagination risqué for 1953. This film along with Wood's other classics were so bad that they became embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. For that reason they have survived to this day. ,negative
 Not a good one. -Not at all. This installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the Amityville home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of Amityville itself. It's basically nothing. My bet is that this film was made for some extra fast-cash to buy a boat or something... because this one's just ridiculous... Thankfully it doesn't kill or ruin the series but it just has no effect on the series at all. I'd have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than The Amityville Curse . ,negative
 Jacqueline Susann wrote several novels all involving sex and melodrama and a few of them actually were made into films including this effort and they all have the distinction of being some of the worst films ever made. Story here is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of television by being ruthless and calculating to everyone around him. He's a playboy of the worst sort using and then throwing away every woman he beds including the wife of the IBC network president. *****SPOILER ALERT***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is in charge of the television network IBC and when his younger wife Judith takes one look at Robin she wastes no time getting into bed with him. Greg falls ill and has to take some time off and this is where Robin steps in and starts trying to run the network but during all this a model named Amanda (Jodi Wexler) who is in love with him kills herself. When Greg returns to his job he tries to get rid of Robin by using the morals clause in his contract when rumors start flying about his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings) who's a gay fashion photographer. This was directed by Jack Haley Jr. who went on to be a very successful producer in both television and movies but this was only his second film as a director and the material he was forced to deal with seems way over his head! The script comes from Susann's novel and that would probably be why this resembles a cross between Alfie and The Valley of the Dolls and I think the reason why her books never could translate well onto film is because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking her stories seriously instead of tongue in cheek. With that the laughs that come from this are unintentional especially during that totally ridiculous fight towards the end of the film which starts when Cannon refuses to give back the slave bracelet to the gay characters! Hemmings was a very good actor but his role here is completely over the top and it has him wearing one of the worst beards in history and using the term chic in every other sentence. Law was not the original choice for the lead but another actor that was cast had a serious accident and Law stepped in and delivers one of the more wooden performances this side of Miles O'Keeffe. The film's script suffers in two different areas in that it's both completely silly and horribly dull and it will test a viewers patience if they choose to watch this. One has to wonder what would be the outcome if a director decided to film one of Susann's novels and not take it seriously because the attempt here is ponderous and ridiculous. ,negative
 This film is a hodge-podge of various idiotic cliches. For instance boy-meets-spoilt-rich-girl and gets her to fall in love with him by harassing her in college (an over-used backdrop in recent Indian commercial films). A male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (having been used ad nauseum in several other films). As with many other recent commercial Hindi films the film abounds with the incongruous insertion of songs which probably contributed to the film's success more than anything else. ,negative
 This movie is about a young girl who goes to live with her rich cousins falls in love with one of her cousin and reject the advance of a amoral suitor who brings trouble on the family. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book I decided to watch the older version. I found it did stay true to Fanny character in the book but it was also boring character. Fanny character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was lackluster; she often appeared to be about to faint. I also did not like Robert Bourbage who played Henry Crawford. I could not imagine him being interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood who played Mary Crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interested in her acting and I kept staring at her wig. I kept expecting it would drop off her head. I could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig. ,negative
 the actors cannot act. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression... EVER. the story is nothing new at all. some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around. that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying that those movies were any good either but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table). and the dancing... THERE WERE ONLY 3 DANCE SEQUENCES IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND 2 OF THEM WERE TAKEN STRAIGHT FROM THE COMMERCIAL. perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer but maybe thats what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is NOT by any means a b-boy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style technique or any wow factor all of which are part of a street dancer's criteria. All of the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable twirls but nothing more. the grande finale left me thinking ... OK now they're gonna get serious all the way through the end when i realized it never was going to happen. i'll admit that im sure it is difficult to make a good dance movie but Step up is no exception to the rule. You Got Served with the exception of its inconsistencies with street dance culture at least had the dance aspect. Save the Last Dance was garbage and so was just about any musical from the past 10 years (although i was impressed with Moulin Rouge)... look to Center Stage for Ballet look to Beat Street for Hip-Hop ,negative
 Want a great recipe for failure? Take a crappy leftist political plot add in some weak & completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known. Let stew for a week (the amount of time probably spent making this trash). The result is 'Steal This Movie ' a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places never before conceived. This movie utterly blew chunks at my face for its entire run time. Words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of. This is not 'Plan 9 From Outer Space.' This is a long boring and sad waste of time. 'Steal This Movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen. It depresses me when I realize that people *actually* took time out of their lives to act in this tripe if you can call it acting. But then again when you have poor direction poor writing poor EVERYTHING - acting is the last thing to criticize. This movie is like a huge disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. I really wish I could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. Thank you Robert Greenwald for giving me newfound respect for every other movie I have ever seen. You have shown me what is truly awful and why I should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy and/or boring. ,negative
 I suffered the watching of this movie at Sitges Festival last month. If there would be a possibility of unfilm a movie to avoid its existence this should be the first in the list. María Lidón isn't a director she is just a dumb woman that pretends that holding a camera with the hand and shout action makes her a professional film maker. What a mistake! The movie itself is pointless and a total waste of good actors that could be doing something better in another project. Val Kilmer does nothing but place his face in front of the camera. His character don't have specific weight in the movie. The same thing can tell about Joss Ackland Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida. It's a shame the way Rade Serbedzija's character has been written. WARNING SPOILERS He spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking with himself in the way (now I'm doing this now I'm low of bats I'll search in my bag now I'm turning left now I'm turning right...) only to bring the audience a clear idea about his actions. It's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director. END OF SPOILERS The usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it: ZERO ,negative
 *****Spoiler Ahead***** I suppose that you shouldn't expect much of a made for TV movie but this one was especially bad the plot was a good idea but badly done the acting wasn't especially good. And the ending of the film was just terrible. The main character was perfectly normal all the way through the film and then suddenly when we find out that she was the killer she just turns into a mentally challenged psychopath. It's completely pathetic. There is only one reason really to watch this film Yasmin Bleeth although haven't we all seen her in a swimsuit before ? Don't bother even watching this waste of time if you want a film about the world of beauty contest then watch Drop Dead Gorgeous instead it's only an infinite number of times better. ,negative
 Travolta and Thurman deserved a better movie. This one is very secondary in all aspects not a single fresh idea. But the biggest problem is this film's ridiculous philosophy. A gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people are becoming almost positive Mickey Mouse-like heroes performing on stage and giving away awards at the ceremony. Perhaps this matches the real life. But showing it as a quite normal happy-ending is beyond my imagination.. What's wrong with shooting a couple of bad Ukrainians if they are not politically correct? - the show must go on! That makes me think that Hollywood writers have a big problem with separating good and evil even if the genre supposed to be a black comedy .. ,negative
 Avoid this one! It is a terrible movie. So what if it is very exciting? All it is is just pointless murders. And the whole thing with Thorn and Michael's curse that was the absolute worst thing they could possibly do to the series! Why couldn't they leave Michael's story a mystery? He's supposed to be the Boogeyman not part of some stupid cult!! Ugh! Thank God for Halloween H20 which wiped out Halloween 3-6! They all sucked! But anyway if you see this movie please expect no more than pointless murders and gore. ,negative
 This was the second MST3K'd movie I ever saw and still holds a place in my heart as one of the most hilariously awful film experiences you are ever going to have. Miles O'Keeffe (sp?) is in this using his chiseled physique to score another payment on the mortgage on his condominium. He's stiff wooden and unconvincing but he still comes across as a cool likable guy and at least he's photogenic. That's the only decent I can find to say about the movie so I thought I would get it out of the way right up front. The fact that he is in the movie adds another point to the score and saves it from being a 1 out of 10 . In no particular order examples of how badly put together this film is: 1)OK the Tanya Roberts clone (Mila) quests to 'the ends of the earth' to find Ator which takes 3 minutes of screen time including the time she spends stumbling around dying from a poisoned arrow in her shoulder (which I assume would have slowed her down quite a bit). So Ator heals her up and takes his trusty aid Thong and sets out to go back to the her castle...and proceeds to take the next 50+ minutes of the movie recovering the ground that Mila traversed in 3 minutes. How does that work??? I know that the intrepid crew is being harassed by magical forces and enemies etc. on the way back but still...! 2)Apparently the writer/director felt the need to add 'depth' to the film by adding a running debate/Socratic dialog/game of 20 questions between Zor (the mean John Saxon wannabe) and the wise man Akronas (the Richard Harris wannabe). But Joe Damoto apparently got his philosophical training from Hallmark cards T-Shirts and bumper stickers and he doesn't understand tempo pacing or timing...and neither do the actors. (Crow's remark during one of these exchanges is the tag line for my entry). The scenes with these two drag on and on bringing the movie to a screeching halt and killing any momentum or excitement generated by the sword-fighting and questing of the heroic trio. 3) Once Ator arrives at the castle (and is captured) things go even farther downhill. Zor decides to feed a bunch of women victims along with Ator and Mila to the Serpent God he keeps in his basement. This scene had some potential for excitement so the director immediately kills this potential by instilling the scene with all the drama of people waiting in line at the DMV to pay their traffic fines. Ator proceeds to have a big battle with the Serpent that is barely more convincing than Bela Lugosi's battle with the rubber octopus puppet in Bride Of The Monster . 4) The climactic scene in which Ator invents the hang glider out of twigs and animal skins is so patently silly that it completely blows the viewer out of the movie and makes you roll on the floor laughing until your sides hurt. 5) Oh yes and the filmmakers decided to include stock footage of an atomic explosion at the end with the moral that Ator decided to destroy the 'atomic nucleus' McGuffin that drives the movie because mankind was 'not ready'. ( Zzzzip! MESSAGE COMING IN!!! ) Just like Bride Of the Monster again come to think of it. All it needed was a bystander to observe They tampered in God's domain. 6) For some reason the version of the movie I saw features introductory and closing homo-erotic credit sequences that have absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone or anything else in the movie. I have no idea where this footage came from but it is actually WORSE than the actual movie it bookends. Watch this only if you are a big fan of Miles or if you enjoy the way MST3K skewers material like this. ,negative
 Rock Hudson's second venture in the science fiction genre after Seconds is Embryo a film that combines elements of the Bride of Frankenstein and Pygmalion in one rather weird film about for lack of a better word a test tube baby that grows up to be Barbara Carrera. Hudson is scientist experimenting in organic development and gets a chance to first experiment on his own Doberman pincher when it is accidentally hit by his car. Some pituitary secretions from the female dog are given to a prematurely born puppy and it grows remarkably into an adult. Exalted with his success Hudson takes a fetus from a dead accident victim and gives it some of the same stuff. What he gets is Barbara Carrera. And she develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious rate. What she doesn't do is develop emotionally. Still Hudson passes her off as his new research assistant to friends and family like sister-in-law Diane Ladd son John Elerick and daughter-in-law Anne Schedeen. Embryo doesn't explore some of the real issues in this kind of science it exploits them instead. The special effects as they are are pretty second rate. Hudson looks like he lost interest in the project about halfway through the film. Now what would have really been interesting is if he had gotten boy child and it grew up to be a harlequin novel hero. Now that would have been something Rock Hudson could have sunk his teeth into. ,negative
 I vowed some time ago to never get another Joe Castro film (perhaps after Near Death ) but I sort of ended up with this one by accident since it was a Troma release & I didn't read the cover carefully. Oops. Well I watched it and it's by no means good but it's I guess sort of tongue in cheek ....if it's not it sure seemed that way. Some intrepid folks from the University of the Rio Grande set out to find if the Chupacabra exists because of surveillance camera footage from someone's GOAT BARN that shows this weird thing hopping across the field of vision. And also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition. There's a couple of camera men one of whom whines the whole time and there some ex-Marine named Army (?!) who is some kind of munitions expert or something. At any rate the do find the Chupacabra on some guy's ranch & set out to find it getting involved with two supposed witches along the way. The creature itself is rather ridiculous-looking with spines on its back & a great big long tongue that Gene Simmons would die for. Eventually after a bunch of folks done get killed so does the Chupacabra and they take it back to the university for an autopsy. So is it from another planet? Is it a genetic creation from some lab in Puerto Rico? Uh they don't tell us really. Not exactly intriguing but not quite terrible either. Definitely not a wide audience for this one. 4 out of 10. ,negative
 Wow. I felt like I needed to shower off after watching this one but maybe there were other reasons that I will leave to your imagination. I felt used and abused after wacking I mean watching this film. Hairy chests thick mustaches and well hairy everything describes this porn/horror movie but hey it was 1981 you can't call it porn in the 70s and 80s without the hair. As a horror flick this bites. But as a piece of exploitation/porn from Italy's rich cinematic history- it definitely has a place in my library. The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles. I wish it had the really poorly dubbed English I think it would have added to the sleaziness factor that already existed. The only white guy who gets laid in the movie is Mark Shannon - he is the moustache wearing hairy chested piece of machismo who really does try and give a performance every time he steps up to bat . This was at the end of an era where porn producers were actually trying to make something artistic. Nothing like panning the camera from a tropical backdrop to a hairy man having doggie-style sex with a woman. I can't help but laugh. This is one of those movies that I pray my future wife and kids never find. ,negative
 Ewww! A Disney sequel that is rubbish! Who would have thought it? Actually quite a lot judging by the comments here and they aren't wrong. I actually looked forward to seeing this awful film based on my liking of the original. And therein lies Disney's whole cash-in mentality. Shovel out any old junk on the back of a success and people will go for it. Don't think they are that cynical? Ask yourself this then....How many Disney films have sequels? And then....How many of those sequels spawn a follow-up? A significantly lower number. Kronk's New Groove is just another example of this. The plot is laughably simplistic and drawn out. Even more annoying was the increased number of out of place items and scenes - an old folks home for example and God forbid an Aztec version of the Boy Scouts! Worse yet Kronk's opposing Chippamunk leader has a completely bewildering over-the-top English accent for no reason whatsoever. An accent that was after a very short while intensely grating on the nerves. There are a couple of good things. The animation is very nice and the voice talent do well with the sub-standard dialogue they are given - especially Warburton in the lead role. But other than this there really is nothing to recommend it. Sure little kids may like it but there is little to amuse mum and dad whilst they sit through this tortuous maiming of the original concept. Avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal you'd use in avoiding a pack of ravening man-eating lions. ,negative
 This movie is absolutely terrible... Definately a bull***t story and even worse acting. Too bad Charlie Sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies. The special effects are 'A-team'-standard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hood. Of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say '-Die evil Americans'. Unless braindead movies are you game don't spend 113minutes of your life on this rubbish. Pick up 'the Platoon' or 'Apocalypse Now' instead. ,negative
 Dustin Hoffman's debut feature isn't as bad as it's reputed to be; a Spanish/Italian co-production filmed in Italy with the director using the pseudonym Dan Ash (!) the film is uneven but generally diverting and deals with a plethora of shady characters in search of a $1 000 000 hidden by gangster Cesar Romero (who despite being third-billed - after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expires before the credit sequence has even rolled!). Hoffman's performance obviously is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an amiable klutz - an accident-prone American treasury agent of Sicilian descent (named Puzzu which nobody seems to be able to get right!) sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain inconspicuous but instead is forever getting into trouble - though he ultimately proves surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot foiling the crooks and winning the girl (Martinelli as Romero's daughter who's somewhat wasted here)!! Still the film's best moments are provided by suave gangster Riccardo Garrone: apart from his would-be hard-boiled persona and the hilarious use of dialect he's flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance in the fulfillment of his various schemes! Also in view of the story being set in Rome it's odd that the police officer investigating the case is a Spaniard (doubtless an exigency of the co-production deal)! Along the years I've missed out on Hoffman's other Italian comedy - ALFREDO ALFREDO (1972) - a number of times (I guess mainly because Leonard Maltin only rates it *1/2 in his Movies & Video Guide ...but then MADIGAN'S MILLION gets a BOMB!); with Pietro Germi directing and co-starring the luscious Stefania Sandrelli the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable and I really hope it turns up again on Italian TV soon... ,negative
 Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie that Julius Harris had a role in. I have not seen all of his movies but Julius Harris was in many good movies and I remember him best from Live and Let Die where he played Tee-Hee and which was full of Voodoo references something that is common here in South Florida! I always thought LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique unlike most of the 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo persona! He has a great style for mystery and the occult and his part in this movie is excellent. Sadly the rest of the movie is something of a comedy. SPOILERS: Three kids who look like they were fired from the cast of THE LITTLE RASCALS get killed by a neighborhood hoodlum who looks like he got fired from the cast of FAME! or as a dancer on DICK CLARK'S AMERICAN BANDSTAND. In other words these kids give LOW BUDGET another dimension. Julius Harris goes to the mortuary-Funeral Home cuts off the three kids' heads (and nobody notices) and then takes them to his Condominium Unit where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids. The three heads get tossed in along with some herbs spices and Voodoo items. At some point Mr. Harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he spills his blood on them and they come to life as talking heads! They can fly make jokes roll their eyes and exact vengeance from the Evil-Doers. They usually look pretty funny flying around but the effects are not bad. For some reason one of the kids always has a switch-blade in his mouth and he uses it to slice people's necks and to cut holes into tires. This movie is weird and funny but only the first time you see it. Meg Foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays a masculine leader of the local gangsters. Strange movie. ,negative
 I just finished watching this film and think it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was so boring that I found myself zooming through it at X2 speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes. I was not just disappointed but angry that I had wasted my money to rent it. It ranks within the top five of the worst films I have ever seen and I've seen thousands of movies! The plot was very confusing. Had I not first read the DVD sleeve cover prior to renting it I would have been totally lost throughout this film. I would not have thought that Tim Robbins after having made such good films as Shawshank Redemption would have agreed to appear in this film. ,negative
 Well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof. To summarize things up cop/dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal(Michael Keaton). well criminal agrees BUT escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop-dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead son). well the police in this movie doesn't have a brain in case they never heard of a TAZER to knock off the criminal without killing him. end of movie as simple as that. But it when all crazy and stupid including the death of 2cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly. ,negative
 I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the dismal movies he'd made after Eraser. End of Days however can be added to the dismal films he's had the misfortune of appearing in. End of Days starts well with a gripping action sequence yet quickly becomes a bore taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium (read Doomsday ). Performances are stale special effects so-so and gore plentiful. Considering myself a die-hard Schwarzenegger fan I couldn't believe I didn't like this film but with such an awful lame script what could Arnie have done besides passed on this turkey? 3 out of 10 ,negative
 Being a long-time Steve Martin fan it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliched script. The screenwriter must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there - it certainly is about the least imaginative movie I've seen in a long time - I knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it began. The African-American stereotypes and slave references are pretty offensive as well. But the thing that was the worst for me was to see Martin in a movie without a trace of wit. He probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally dumbed down script. He must be behind in his alimony to be in such a lame effort. ,negative
 I was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out. Commercials for it made it look quirky and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. Sadly I was terribly disappointed with Nurse Betty. Personally I've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully in my opinion are Tarantino and the Coens. There isn't that much violence in Nurse Betty but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when I was supposed to laugh. Of course for me part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where I was being asked to. The film doesn't much work as a drama either. Renee Zellweger's Betty the story's protagonist is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way. I will say Zellweger acts the role quite well and Freeman Rock and Greg Kinnear all do good jobs too. The problem is in the writing; Freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character. It's really too bad. 3/10 ,negative
 Director and FX man John Carl Buechler doesn't have to do much in order to terrify me; the sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to strike fear into my heart. His lamentable straight-to-video output in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental shop; twenty years later and his DVDs occupy the same space. It seems that the more things change the more they stay the same. You can rely on old JCB to serve up dreck whatever the format and regardless of advances in movie-making technology. In this contemptible offering a bunch of friends travel to a remote town where they discover the secret treasure hoard of Jeremiah Stone AKA the forty-nineran evil claim-jumping cannibalistic miner who caused havoc in the mid-1800s. Before his death Jeremiah cursed anyone who should find his gold and it's not long before the pick-axe wielding killer is back bumping off the hapless treasure seekers. With its dreadful script unimpressive make-up effects and Scooby-Doo style villain 'The Curse of the Forty-Niner' is par for the course for Buechler. Only genre stalwarts Keren Black Richard Lynch and John Phillip Law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to awful (although I'll forgive Alexandra Ford who is a complete hottie). Even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed since most of the women keep their clothes on and a lot of the deaths occur off-screen (which is probably not such a bad thing since the on-screen deaths are pathetic). 'The Curse of the Forty-Niner' is another in a long list of duds for John Carl. ,negative
 I was actually looking forward to this movie. The commercials made it look real cool and action packed. And I heard that Claire Daines' character was arrested for assault so I thought that maybe she would kick a lot of ass and that would be cool. BUT NOOOOOOOO!!. Their was hardly any action at all and the character were all kinda bland. The only saving grace was Omar Epps and even he didn't help this movie much. ,negative
 So bad as good - not only the script is obvious but the acting is not just poor but pathetic. The worst of all is the definition of the characters: unrealistic ingenuity affected reactions camera forcing to watch superficial aspects which are introduced as keys to the plot. Can't prevent laughing when at the end main character says to second something like 'your daughter plays no soccer and knows no cooking'. Such offense to female intelligence defines the level of this film. Is the film about the psychological behaviour of the second character? about its impact on the main character? or just a sequence of events set in order to heat for the obvious ending? Pls make more of these - I had a good time guessing what next would go wrong... ,negative
 Black Vengeance is an alternate title for Ying hung ho hon AKA Tragic Hero (1987). I have just seen this on VHS together with the first part of the story Gong woo ching ( Rich and Famous ) also 1987. (The poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-DVD set of movies starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo) Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2) Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth movie is called The Black Six ). Strangely while the characters retain their original names in Rich and Famous in Black Vengeance Chow Yun-Fat's character is named Eddie Shaw Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry and Andy Lau is called Johnny. Also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films. Perhaps that was the year they were American-dubbed. According to the release dates given on IMDb Tragic Hero was released before Rich and Famous . Was there any reason for releasing the sequel first? Despite some users' comments I enjoyed these films although they aren't among CYF's best such as The Killer and Hard-Boiled which are truly astonishing. However if one day I come across a 2-DVD set of Rich and Famous and Tragic Hero I won't hesitate to buy it. Hopefully these comments about Black Vengeance clear up which was also for me a mystery as to where it belonged in Chow Yun-Fat's filmography. ,negative
 Wow. The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre. But still even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense. Water has become incredibly rare substance? Well that's strange considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe. And pretty easy to make. Glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms and voilà water. Instead of water the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after. Water as a plot device was just dumb dumb dumb. The comedy seemed labored and contrived and forced. The comedy in the TV series Red Dwarf was labored and contrived and forced but it was actually amusing. Here instead i felt like saying Ha ha that was just so funny i forgot to laugh... Sigh... all that money put into sets costumes actors... what a waste... Rather than just whimper and whine and complain at it's lameness my recommendations to make it better: 1) Use a believable plot device. 2) Get rid of the comedy . None of the actors were really any good at it. The movie would work better as a serious action adventure. The obvious intention of the writers was to do a spoofy comedy but they didn't quite pull it off. It's not likely i'll ever watch this again. It's too much a total hack job. ,negative
 doesn't mean this movie is good. i was really frustrated by it on many levels. it's kind of the tip of the hat to bukowski. hey i've read that guy in college--let's see what matt dillon does with him. and i like matt dillon. i thought he came close to looking a little like hank but mostly just the ruddy cheeks. i have to care about a character though and there just wasn't much here to care about. i think time might be cruel to bukowski and that bothers me a lot because the writing was solid in a sort of post counter culture time. hard to sit through scenes that went nowhere and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit. i ask for very little got less. ,negative
 In Moscow the priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to guide him in the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija) that is missing while researching the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell beneath the city. I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. I am totally disappointed since this film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not understand how Val Kilmer accepted to participate in this production. There are two shameful reviews in IMDb promoting this movie and they are typically fake written by users with only one review in this site. There are two possible ways to see this boring and awful film: my wife and I napped many times because of the monotony of this pointless story and we used the rewind button of the DVD to repeat each lost scene. However the correct way should have been the use of the fast forward or the stop button to end this crap faster. My vote is one. Title (Brazil): Cidade Sombria ( Dark City ) ,negative
 In a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously and move into 'adult' films Mr. Hughes gives us this film about a young married couple. True it's got every cliche in the book in it silly fantasy stuff and all that but more importantly- it's got Elizabeth McGovern. Clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a John Hughes film she lends a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as her husband but McGovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty. The 'teen film' fun that worked so well in other Hughes films falls flat here- like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9 but keeps telling them when you are 15 and you wish he'd find some new material. But I keep going back to McGoverns performance because it's truly moving. Mr. Hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them (Some Kind of Wonderful Breakfast Club) and when his material bumps up against a true talent some wonderful things can happen. If only he'd trust that it doesn't have to be tarted up with the silly fantasy stuff. ,negative
 It's difficult to find anything worth of praise with this movie. It's not the worst picture ever made but that's not saying a whole lot. The plot is quite incoherent and unbelievable; it seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie but decided to make it underwater to cash in at the success of The Abyss. In some scenes it seems as if the story indeed was set to outer space initially; the sub has a landing gear the technicians are worried of a rip in a rubber diving suit at the depths of several kilometers where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can. The movie starts out okay with planning of a recovery of a lost naval sub. After that the movie takes a plunge along with the Siren 2. Effects are so-so. The navigational screens are all done on Commodore 64 (remember this is 1990 not 1983) the sub is controlled like no other sub ever; instead of control consoles the officers have keyboards with which they enter long number sequences to control various functions of the ship. The interior of the ship isn't too convincing either. The final scenes leap from awkward to absurd. Welcome to the fifties you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door. I fail to see enjoyment factor here. The movie is neither good nor hilariously bad MST3k-style (until you get to the final scene) it's like eating a slightly bad apple. ,negative
 For weeks I had been looking forward to seeing this movie only to find myself hugely disappointed after wards. In my opinion the only good thing 'River Queen' had going for it was the amazing scenery used as backgrounds. The story line was all over the place Samantha's character Sarah was very difficult to understand and what on earth were all the many close ups of her face for? It brought absolutely nothing to the story-if there was one at all!A better actor for the part of Boy could also have been selected to me it sounded like he read his lines straight of the script while shooting his scenes.Overall a real shame as it could have been such a good movie. ,negative
 I know a lot of people like this show and i apologise to people who think this show is awesome but it is the worst show ever created. Sure i'm sure I would be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson wasn't on it. I mean I think that testing out cars and doing things like seeing whether a car can beat a aeroplane is awesome! But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons I hate this man: . He thinks it's cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking measuring your distance and time by driving 200mph down the road and then resting for two hours. . He clearly thinks that he is better than Richard Hammond and James May. . He's got my best friend saying pathetic things. . He screams at kids just for taking a picture of him. I'm sorry top gear but Jeremy Clarkson is a freak. ,negative
 As powerful as the true story of Phoolan is this book this film is based on came out before she herself was released from Prison and had the chance to tell it. It is allegedly based on her diaries but she is illiterate. How does that work? That said some areas of he film are accurate and the acting isn't bad with some sensitivity being shown. Really though this story needs to be old in a TV series. Far to much happens to cram into a couple of hours. Read her autobiography. Highly recommended. It is a fantastic story. ,negative
 Rent this only movie if you're in the mood for laughs (for sheer stupidity) as this movie wouldn't scare a bunch of kindergartners at a Halloween party! The trouble is there is too much gore for kiddies so definitely don't put this in your VCR for the toddlers. It starts off with a little bit of promise giving you the impression that the box cover artist may have actually started watching this film before designing the cover but then descends quickly into epic stupidity. The killer scarecrows are clumsy oafs that are about as scary as the one in the Wizard of Oz but not quite as smart. If they'd only had a brain...? I got this movie for $1.20 at a local discount/close-out store and even so I feel somewhat ripped off. I think with all the other comments posted here if you actually pay to see this you can only blame yourself. ,negative
 Completely agree with other review. I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. This was after I slowly backed away from the TV with remote in hand jaw dropping lower and lower. The quality of the filming is beyond low budget. It doesn't even look like a freaking movie. If I were watching 'home video' footage from a documentary I would expect it. In summary: Avoid avoid avoid. Boooo Lion's Gate! Completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and I hope that I've saved others from renting or owning it. ,negative
 Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece full of drama emotion and powerful memorable music. The maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but principalled Gilda as a horny ditz. Opera certainly can be adapted to cinema --- look at Zeferelli's magnificent La Traviata --- but when a work is as superb as Rigoletto it doesn't need cheap gimmicks. It might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that. ,negative
 Well they sent it on TV between midnight and 2:00 am - it seems like the right time to watch it and then go to bed afterwards ... No it was not really living up to my expectations. I think the Dogma concept is good because the film then gets closer to what's really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and mood-making music out. But then again this concept requires some interesting action between the characters. I cannot say that I know King Lear (the Shakespeare version) very well if I had known the play I would probably have been able to predict much of the film. Well a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display - and we certainly see some bad sides. Oh yes the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin and behind this paint you may find an animal. If you then compare it with Italiensk for begyndere (Italian for beginners) or Mifunes sidste sang (Mifune's last song) you see the same but opposite thing: A crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way. And if you dare do you may win. When the film had ended I thought to myself: Oh that's why I haven't seen it before ... The film has its own beauty. The quality of the work of the cameraman actors etc is good. But the script could need something more. A plot maybe wouldn't hurt. ,negative
 In the wake of the matrix this travesty of a film with loose connections to VR has been reissued with the tag-line The Matrix just got Deadler! in a box with a very Matrix inspired cover (still called Expect to Die though). Due to the choice of font however the tag-line looks to all the world like it says Beablier . Anyway. To complete the transformation to Matrix wannabe they have mocked up a VR fight scene with a Morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character DOES NOT FEATURE IN THE FILM. Overall this film is a travesty on every level. Jalal Mehri is an awful actor and does not impress with his martial arts. However his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie who in this film is simply the worst actor I have ever seen. Clearly he was chosen to make Jalal look good in comparison. Worst film I have seen for a long long time. ,negative
 Full disclosure: I was born in 1967. At first the premise tickled me -- after all if you were a teenager growing up in the age of Reagan a trip down memory lane was worth a laugh or three. Pop Rocks Atari and Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots? Loved 'em not *despite* the fact they were goofy but *because* they were goofy and silly and fun. But when VH1 decided to make the series I Love Last Tuesday I knew enough was enough. Goes Hal Sparks have nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter how idiotic Slinkys are? (Wait let me check... hmmm no. No it appears he doesn't.) Snarky snotty uber-hip posturing has its place but enough already! ,negative
 This is just a long advertisement for the movie The Death Tunnel . Although it is an interesting history of the Waverly Hills Sanatorium the whole ghost theory is up to your interpretation. More Ghost Orbs which you can duplicate with dust in front of a flash camera and the Ectoplasmic Mist is just someone's cigarette smoke lit up with the camera flash. I couldn't see any Shadow People until they drew an outline around the blurry distortion of the image. No scientific explanations were suggested for the phenomena only paranormal. Perhaps these are only events one would have to see to believe so be sure to make plans to visit the Sanatorium on your next vacation in Louisville Kentucky. ,negative
 The DVD for this film is by Alpha Video--a company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints. In Alpha's defense often that is the only print available but the specialize in public domain and cheap-o films. If you can find another print by a different company try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded. Still compared to most Alpha DVDs this one is excellent--especially since the sound is pretty clear (and Alpha never seems to include closed captionings--even with films with horrid sound). A man has been dating a lady for a very long time. One night he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon afterwords he comes clean to his fiancée about this she forgives him and they marry. Very soon after the wedding he gets a frantic call from the other woman--she NEEDS to see him and has just tried to kill herself. When they meet he learns that she has an STD and she wanted him to know that he too might now have it. Then although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! The makes a HUGE mistake. He does not tell his doctor and he doesn't tell his new wife. Some time passes and now she and the baby are infected! At this point the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people (actually these were just films of people with STDs that they spliced into the film--most of whom have syphilis). In some ways the film is very progressive. It addresses a serious issue and it's interesting how the film encourages couples NOT to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual urges--but only with each other (not bad advice at all). On the other hand the film never exactly says what it's talking about. They never use the terms STD VD or the like nor does it even name the diseases. Often it is referring to syphilis but at other times it's talking about herpes or other STDs--the information just isn't very clear or specific--a VERY common problem with such films from this era. Audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their 'faster' friends explain it all to them! Speaking of such films in the 1930s-50s lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films decrying the dangers of drugs and sex (though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of cheesecake for audiences who usually could not see such racy fare in Hollywood films). Many of these are hysterically funny since they are so over-done and the information so inaccurate. The most famous examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both by the same two-bit production company) and compared to how salacious and stupid those two films are this cheap film seems like it should be in the Criterion Collection!! Interestingly there are weirdos out there (I would definitely be included among them) that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun. This one however isn't THAT bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isn't as grotesque as some similar films. While the message really should have been more explicit and useful for a 1933 film it's pretty good--despite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene. Remember kids--just say 'NO' to suicide! Oh by the way the two years of treatment they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis back in 1933. Nowadays it's a lot more treatable--as are the rest of the STDs. ,negative
 I have to agree with the other two comments. I waited over a month to see this great new show A&E had been hyping. What a disappointment!!! The show is pretty much all about Ryan Buell. His voice-overs are campy not creepy. It sounds as if he is talking into a can. As of the second episode which is roughly 30 minutes or so (if you take out the commercials) he is being chased or followed by something that he knows is demonic. He can't say the name anytime someone needs to convey that name they write it on a piece of paper and hand it to someone else. Not particularly informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us. Why can't he say the name?...supposedly it would give the demon more power. Funny I always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities. If you know the exact name of the demon doesn't it make it easier for you to cast them out. Now the next episode which airs in just a little while is titled exorcism . So is Ryan in need of an exorcism already? Not to say that it couldn't happen but the show so far has not given any evidence or proof of anything. I can tell Ryan that if I were a small child hell if I was an adult and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me I would look elsewhere for help!!! Besides which if you don't use holy water & blessings etc. in the right way don't you risk just further infuriating whatever is already mad at you? I will probably watch tonight but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first it will probably be the last time I watch it! ,negative
 I don't know where most of you were at but where I watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced we had people laughing mostly at the campy plot line the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of Brosnan. The only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to the ABBA concert at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in Sept of 79 so I did appreciate them then and I still do now. But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so poorly staged the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be Meryl's worst production. I cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage. So save your money wait for it to come out on DVD and then maybe spend your money on something better like cat litter. ,negative
 If you are a weirdo who thinks it's romantic and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother get her pregnant and then have sex with her again once she's had an abortion AND not tell her that she is related to you then you would like this movie. Nevermind the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home - it makes it even more disgusting and deplorable that he has no conscience as to what he's doing. He can't do right by his job his family OR Maria. He's a loser. There is nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it is vile and incestuous. It moves slowly and it leads nowhere for over the first half of the movie. I couldn't even finish watching this pathetic excuse for a 'romance'. I'm glad we didn't waste our money in the movie theater on this one. 0/10 ,negative
 This film has an amazing cast. MGM took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home. While they have amassed a fortune over the years they also have been selfish jerks. One of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy themselves a good name (sort of like Carnegie) but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to O'Brien. And since she's an orphan they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give HER property away and look like great philanthropists. There also is a goofy subplot involving fairies--led by the wonderful character actor Henry Davenport. And since O'Brien is Irish (as evidenced by her outrageous accent) she and the little people make up much of the plot. Frankly I absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished they'd just dropped it entirely. Instead the story could STILL have been about sweet Margaret melting the mean old men's hearts--this would have worked. But...the little people ?!? Sheesh! Overall the actors try very very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe. I noticed a lot of people liked this film--I guess I'm just an old grouch! I found the film horrible difficult to watch. ,negative
 I do not know what today's movie goers expect but after 68 years of movie watching.. (Well maybe I didn't watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years so make that 58 years of movie watching) I expect to be entertained not bored to tears assaulted by continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled. Surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have NO imagination little if any talent a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on long after the purpose for it has elapsed. That anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie when it is nothing more that Hollywood garbage is beyond me. As a combat veteran I have seen violence blood and gore in many forms and movies like We were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get but it has redeeming value. Surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor with no writing ability no directorial training no experience in film editing and a total lack of contact with reality. Just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as FBI agents setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops etc.. A high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like... ,negative
 Though Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good TV director with a few good full-length to his credit Homegrown is just a mess in its script and direction. Despite performances from Billy Bob Thorton John Lithgow Kelly Lynch Jon Bon Jovi Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson a cast this good couldn't save the film. Gyllenhaalics will know that Jake and Maggie are in the film but you don't see Jake very well and Maggie's only in it for 30 seconds as babysitter tipping off Lithgow's character about a bust. It's not even a lowbrow pot comedy as the film was intended to be. It just wasn't funny. ,negative
 An updated version of a theme which has been done before. While that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesn't reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do. Predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark. Not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending. ,negative
 i didn't hate this one. i just couldn't adapt to the story. it didn't really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this. i'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant. my favourite Daniel Day Lewis films are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York. there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about all i liked in it though. this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random. i can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating 7.8. i would give this film a miss if i was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so i guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think. i didn't really like it............. 4/10.............j.d Seaton ,negative
 Ouch. This is one ugly movie. Not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed the book as well. Horrible. How you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me but they sure did. Don't even think about even renting this. ,negative
 Well to do American divorcée with more money than brains buys a rundown villa in Tuscany. (Much more money; whilst having to dicker over the price she subsequently manages to cook sumptuous buffets for her workmen and wander around Italy indefinitely with no job or apparent means of support.) Interminable boredom and the inevitable Italian lover ensue; this is a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane acts like an unskilled clueless teenage ingénue throughout - which dynamically clashes with her seriously fading looks - along the way smashing into a variety of (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes dykes divas senile contessas and gigolos among them. Bloated with unnecessary scenes the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in 'La Dolce Vita'. (A similar conceit was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'Only You' Norman Jewison's vastly superior ode to Italy and romance). 'Tuscan Sun' may be the most vacant piece of cinema of the last decade despite its admittedly well-lensed panoramas of Italy. Bonus negative point for the extraneous lover parachuted in at the last minute to provide requisite Hollywood ending for its targeted audience of Oprah-brainwashed housewives. Avoid at all costs unless of course you view Oprah and Dr. Phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse. ,negative
 Oh Mr. Carell! How far you've fallen! After a glowing moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE Steve Carell's choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since. Although THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN was entertaining it was dwarfed by his Sunshine character. Hoping to find something that'd get me to spew popcorn from my nose I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and see what possible guffaws might await me here. Not much... Given the trite and clichéd script the entire film felt forced and unemotional. Poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current U.S. administration's take on the environment Evan Almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserably. Nearly every person on Earth knows the story of Noah and The Ark. God's wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while Noah his family and two of each of His creatures on Earth rode out the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark. It was a huge moment in human history (if you believe the biblical text). So why would God appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the world's animals for a few minutes after a dam break? The simple answer is that He never would. Too much emphasis was given to U.S. government policy and not enough on world events making Evan Almighty a terribly myopic and Ameri-centric film. Although designed as a comedy it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs. Maybe a few grunts and a smile but little else. John Goodman (CARS) pulls in another forced performance as the despicable Congressman Chuck Long who's only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OF LESS) as God can't help mop up this soaking wet disaster-of-a-film. The only funny moments are between Carell and the animals especially as Evan learns what animal magnetism is REALLY like. Birds literally flock to him. Sheep herd around him. Lions take pride in being near him (please forgive the puns). The special effects were fun to watch but were brief (with good reason). The flood was interesting in that the Ark was obviously guided by His hand and shoved in just the right direction. But other than that you're in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect. ,negative
 Abysmal Indonesian action film from legendary Arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for future Cinemax pap like 'China O'Brien' and 'Do or Die' with Erik Estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star Pat O'Brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair-styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet. This guy's physical prowess resembles a more femme Mark Gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to Chris Mitchum as Tom Selick. Powerful. At least the action is mindless and non-stop with some daring Asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and/or meth addicts with no concept of reality. One poor extra gets gorno-ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. Classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as I would rather trust a rattlesnake! are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third-rate polizioteschi voice actors. Random highlight: some crazy dude eating live lizards. Movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2/10 ,negative
 The English translation of the title on the DVD version of this film is Graveyard of Horrors but I think that must be an error. It should have been called Graveyard of Horribles. Horrible acting horrible editing horrible story and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard. Horrible. ,negative
 People please don't bother to watch this movie! This movie is bad! It's totally waste of time. I don't see any point here. It's a Stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor. I rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again. ,negative
 This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But I was wrong. First the weird looping? It was like watching America's Funniest Home Videos . The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Now the final scene transcends I must say. It's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. What crappy dancing. Horrible and beautiful at once. ,negative
 After watching this movie I have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film. For one as a general comment the storyline was literally unbelievable and filled with incredible clichés all around. The same obviously goes for the dialogue which panders to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. The acting was terrible as well with Kane showing throughout the entire movie at the very most 3 separate and distinct emotions. Even the use of modern special effects failed as each prop was easily distinguishable from its real life counterpart. Overall I would not recommend for anyone to even think about viewing this feature as it will most surely waste 83(not even 90!) minutes of your life. ,negative
 The film was half over before I managed to figure out what was going on. It's a dog's breakfast of a movie about four family Thanksgiving dinners. The cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other. When it's all over ten hours later --- well it seems like ten hours --- you're puzzling over what it was all about. I don't want to see a movie about dinner table squabbling. There is enough of it in my own family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion. ,negative
 ....and now I'm up to episode #7. I really was hoping it'd be over by now (not to mention canceled once everything connected with the show -including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere never to be seen again) because this series really is dire. To have this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is at best misleading! It's so hard to believe Ben Elton could write something this bad maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before. In some episodes I haven't even laughed once! Oh and I can't believe Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped doing 'My hero' & started doing this instead his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can't read and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for 'Blessed' were. Don't get me wrong 'My Hero' is not masterpiece but it's a million times better than this piece of junk. And just to annoy me even more I bet this gets a DVD release as well when there are so many great TV series' that aren't getting released! ,negative
 Let me preface this by going on record I am a huge George Clooney fan and I love John Krasinski in 'The Office'. Well I was and I did. This was the world's worst hang nail and it took 113 minutes to rip it off. The stupefying boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would be over. Every funny scene was in the previews. All three of them. There was no real story no character development and the script was just plain bad. I've had a colonoscopy that was more enjoyable. The title should have been SuperDuper Bad. This movie is a lock for a Razzie. It should get a whole slough of Razzies. I want my money back. ,negative
 Seriously folks...I was getting ready to actually write the Razzie Council and recommend this movie as Razzie Champ for 2007...until I got on IMDb.com and realized its copyright date was 2006 and not 2007. Seriously though this movie could have easily been a Razzie Champ. This movie sucked! How in the world this piece of crap was overlooked even for a Razzie nomination in 2006 is beyond me because it easily could have competed with Basically It Stinks Too for the 2006 Razzie Championship. I rented this movie on the recommendation of a female neighbor of mine who told me Oh My God after seeing this movie it's going to be a long long time before I ever stop at a rest stop ever again! I couldn't believe how not scary and awful this movie was! Possible spoilers below not that you'll be missing out on anything. OK first of all...the problem...the rest stop itself. Obviously the director of this piece of crap doesn't know the first thing about women. The toilets in that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie Trainspotting. I don't claim to know everything there is to know about women but one thing I do know is that women for the most part are total and complete hygiene/neat freaks. Given the choice between taking a crap on either of those toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods a woman is going to opt for squatting in the woods. I know because I've gone camping with them before and they have no problem squatting in the woods. So right there...major plot hole and untruth. Second of all...she comes out of the rest stop and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found not him nor his car. He just left. She starts screaming his name wondering where he is. Ummm...hello? You're standing on wet mud...did it ever occur to you to look down for some tire tracks? I mean his car is gone...it didn't just get up and fly away. And actually that makes me think...I actually was looking down at her feet and there weren't any tread marks in the mud. How...exactly...did that happen? Third...the Bible thumping mobile home family with the freak midget in the back taking Polaroid pictures...Wtf!?!?!?? They made absolutely no sense at all and it's as if the director just threw them in to be weird for the sake of being weird. They made no sense at all and had no place even being in the movie. Fourth...Oh My God this...I mean finally...near the end of the movie...she finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling inside the rest stop. I'm like You...dumb...bi**h. You've been locked up in this rest stop for all this time...and you just..now...see...the escape hatch on the ceiling? I mean...it's like they threw that in just because the killer tossed gasoline on the floor through the window and was getting ready to light a match. So she needs to get to higher ground to avoid being burned and...oh look! A perfect reason for her to get to higher ground! An escape hatch on the ceiling! It's like...Why didn't she go through that before? Most people in that situation would have seen that from the moment they were locked in that rest stop and gotten the f**k out of Dodge. When they showed that escape hatch at the end of the movie I was like You have got to be kidding me. Fifth...what was the deal with all the of people she encountered continuing to just disappear? The girl in the broom closet in the rest stop? The dumb cop? Her at the end of the movie when she ended up in the broom closet herself? It was never explained. Personally when they did this I thought to myself Oh Christ on a cracker it's her. She's the killer. Wonderful. She killed all of those people doesn't remember doing it and the writers of this movie just ripped off a certain French horror flick that I can't mention on IMDb.com or I'll be blacklisted for giving away the ending (that movie sucked by the way too people). But it wasn't. She wasn't the killer and the whole deal with the dead people disappearing was never ever explained. Oh for the love of God people stay away from this movie! This movie sucked balls and I have now got a serious bone to pick with my neighbor. It's on the 2 for $1 rack at Family Video don't even rent it if someone gives it to you for free! ,negative
 Basically the first two Critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way. This movie is way more of a B-movie that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons. This is the first sequel that doesn't really follows the plot of the first two movies. Basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well as good as none since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late) and the budget for this one obviously went down again. To save even more costs the movie got shot back-to-back with part 4 which I imaging will be just as bad since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one. It's just a typical B-genre movie that doesn't really have any originality in it or brings entertainment. It makes Critters 3 a real redundant sequel you can easily do without. Granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just ain't exactly a good one either. The movie just falls flat as a science-fiction/horror/comedy. Also kind of strange to notice how the Critters has suddenly changed in this one. They are about double their usual size this time without giving an explanation for that and they are even more Gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous one. The movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of Leonardo DiCaprio. He was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby-faced like he still does now. I like watching this well known actors in their early roles. It's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course DiCaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days. Really a too silly and lame movie. 4/10 ,negative
 I thought that this movie lacked the building dramatic suspense the first movie had. This is hard to accomplish when the film takes place over a week. The original movie lead up to the final climatic scene over a period of a year and it still was less violent than the sequel. One good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly because the plot seemed rushed. When Rachel's best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie. Another bring down was the involvement of Amy Irving. All her scenes brought down the movies pace. The dialog in this movie was terrible. It in no way reflected the way kids talk. In conclusion this movie could have been a hit but fell apart after the opening scene. ,negative
 This movie starts out great and sucks you in. Most acting is good until Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang- everyone else sounds British-like even the Muslim) shows up and proves that he can't act. You can live with that until the first fight scene where all they all fall to pieces. Why does Patrick Swayze fight baddies with an ax when he just stuck his sword into the ground 5 minutes ago. There's further misplacing of swords a few minutes later and people knowing about other people they shouldn't know about. Other reviewers mentioned Troubled Production and it shows. At the end I just didn't even care about the fight scenes sure the CGI Dragon was weak but the storyline was the biggest letdown. ,negative
 There is no way to put into words just how bad how shapeless paceless and laughless these Vice Academy films really are. You have to experience one for yourself. For the third time in a row writer-director Rick Sloane does not show even an ounce of writing or directing talent. There is nothing here that a person above the age of 5 will believe or laugh at yet the (very brief) nudity and other plot elements make the films unsuitable for kids. Which leads me to believe that they are really aimed at adults with the mental capabilities of 5-year-olds. Elizabeth Kaitan makes a more than welcome replacement for Linnea Quigley - she is winningly bubbly and cute and her wonderful big smile is about the only thing that can make a viewer smile as well. But watching her and the other girls in this film is like watching a bunch of flowers in a desert covered with horse manure. (*) ,negative
 I will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. Innovative doesn't mean it's a good film it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films. The simple plot is.. well.. simple. I got to the point where I didn't care if they destroy the building or not. If I had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time I swear I would hurl the DVD out the window. And there's also the protagonist. They try to make him lovable but he's a freakin pervert! Sniffing the girls bra sneaking peeks at her when she's naked putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps putting her bra on a blow up sex doll (which she takes her panties off while hes asleep and slips them on his doll.. umm) What irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting. In the photo gallery on the DVD you can see what the film looked liek before they greyscaled it and put in a color tint (digitally too).. The film looked a LOT better without the effect.. so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy... bah. I could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap.. I think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good 5 - 10 minutes. This doesn't compare to Delicatessen ( like so many are tryign to do). Delicatessen has characters you can get into and like.. these people here just grunt and giggle. Lastly I would also liek to point out that this was also tryign to be like a German Impressionistic film liek the old silents. One of the problems with most foreign especially artsy films is that thety focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the 'space' of the scene. It results in the audience not really understanding what;s going on because they don't get a sense of the space of the surroundings. Anyway it's rubbish. The short film on the DVD Surprise was a heckuva lot better. ,negative
 Set in the mid 1800's when the British is clearing New Zealand outback wilderness to establish colonies. The daughter of a British army surgeon Sarah(Samantha Morton) falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. The Maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for the Europeans to deal with. By the time Sarah's child which she calls Boy is born his father is dead. By the age of six Boy is kidnapped by his father's family and Sarah will begin her search for him with a man(Kiefer Sutherland) who is deeply in love with her. Two-time Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of this movie. Sutherland is a total waste. Also starring are: Cliff Curtis Stephen Rea Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene. This movie is rated R for some sexual content and violent battle scenes. I find the title RIVER QUEEN very misleading and the DVD cover with Sutherland only and making you believe he is the leading star should be a crime. ,negative
 Wow! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy. If the cheap-looking opening credits don't tell you you're in for quite a ride then the diabolically tragic writing sure will. A diabetic kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation onto the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people. Need I say more? This movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with iMovie (note that spooky color inversion) and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some late-night Cinemax special. Actually thats not fair as the actors didn't have much room to work around the abysmal script. Parts of this movie really seem like parody especially when one character picks up his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever conceived by humans with the worst lip-synching ever performed to go along with it. The gore here is also a major disappointment. In most B-movies such as this there is a thick layer of cheap gore FX to make up for what the story and acting lacks. Here the stuff is so cheap that it's not even fun. This movie actually makes Jack Frost 2 look like lots of fun in comparison. If you think this movie is the worst one you've ever seen then you probably haven't gotten deep into the world of straight-to-video B-horror. Regardless this movie will cause you a great deal of mental anguish no matter what your background. ,negative
 I was hoping this would be of the calibre of Das Boot and echo the stark realism created by acclaimed German Director Leni RiefenStahl in her documentaries sadly I was monumentally disappointed. The story line is implausible and defies credulity. An RAF airman is shot down and somehow finds his way to a hospital in Dresden. Anna a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to become engaged to a doctor she works with falls in love with the airman and they make love. The next evening at a lavish engagement party the airman turns up disguised as a German officer and dances with Anna. Although well directed and acted to me it is soap opera of the lowest order. ,negative
 Yes sure this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it. It's a good effort the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie what a scream queen Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie the effects are nicely done okay sometimes you can guess how it is done. Some people have problems with the use of the camera I can't see what's wrong with that. It's so strange that so many people dislike this movie I really enjoyed it. Of course the script isn't original but give me one that is I mean so many slashers are made in the woods. maybe it is all predictable but it's a worth see I have seen a lot worser I can tell you that ,negative
 Solomon and Sheba was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the late 50's when I was a kid: a biblical epic spectacular with well known performers unusual costumes lots of extras and battle sequences. So I went to see it; but I remember that back then Solomon and Sheba didn't impress me at all which was a strange thing since I had enjoyed a lot The Ten Commandments Quo Vadis Helen of Troy and others. The point is that when you are a kid you disregard things in pictures that adults don't (bad acting for instance) and you are easier to please with warriors in their armors battles sword duels and action so if your'e not impressed then something is wrong with a product of this genre. This film though it has some of such features is definitely standard and average. Yul Brynner's wooden performance as the Hebrew king doesn't even light when he has voluptuous and half naked Gina Lollobrigida dancing around him provocatively. She is better and renders an acceptable acting. George Sanders doesn't look interested in what he is doing and Marisa Pavan (Pier Angeli's twin sister) doesn't add at all as a sort of Brynner's conscience. The final sword duel between Brynner and Sanders is just for the plot and lacks interest and intensity (it had to filmed that's all). Not a good farewell for director King Vidor Solomon and Sheba will probably be remembered as Ty Power's last unfinished picture. ,negative
 I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was billed as the world premiere of the movie by the host (though it seems that people here have seen it previously). I have to say I still don't really know what to make of the movie. I am unfamiliar with the book purchased the ticket only two hours beforehand and had only limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough as it seems as I had problems getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes being narrated by Jones' character but somehow that perspective did not fit for me. And I really cannot say if some of the laughs the movie got were calculated or not. The cuts were abrupt and disruptive the scenes seemed somehow slapped together and the storytelling did not always make sense right away (even leaving out the supernatural parts) - the actors were really good but could not really save the movie somehow. It was entertaining but sometimes only in the sense that I sat there thinking about technical details of movie making and what went wrong with this one. I still do not know what kind of mood the director intended the movie to have. It was a strange mix of light dark supernatural. It sadly did not draw me in at all and I rather watched it with a technical eye. But thinking about what is wrong with a movie while watching it is the best sign that a movie somehow has failed. I would have definitely expected something else with these actors involved...too bad! ,negative
 I am a fan of the paranormal and I love Ghost Hunters so when this show first came out I decided to give it a try. I could barely sit through one episode. The show is so obviously staged. I mean come on every single episode involves someone being possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family. Another huge flaw is that these guys never debunk anything. When I watch Ghost Hunters they find evidence and try to disprove it and if they can't then it is evidence. On this show they find a voice or a piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost. This completely ruins their credibility unlike TAPS and Ghost Hunters who actually know what they're doing. Honestly if you're interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it watch Ghost Hunters. ,negative
 Even though this is the first film by the broken lizard group it's the last one I saw. Having mildly enjoyed Super Troopers and managed to sit through the crap that is club dred and beerfest I was surprised to hear they did an earlier film. Now i didn't sit down with high hopes but was hoping for a funny campus romp. My friend asked me to keep in mind they are younger (obviously) and its their first foray into film. I did and was still disappointed. Not taking away the acting and comedy skills of the BL guys they were OK. The whole film was tiresome clichéd and frankly boring. Some of the other actors in the film were really poor at acting. And the Rugby game didn't even resemble rugby. Poor showing. They improved drastically with Super Troopers and have declined since. Lets hope they get back on form with Super Troopers 2 ,negative
 I know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget indie film. But the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open America's eyes to the cozy relationship between the government and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it. But somehow the documentary aspect of it takes away from its drama. The protests during the 2004 Republican convention in New York were not that compelling to make a documentary about it. Those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's. It would have been better to stick to a drama format. Perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy. ,negative
 Combine good casting bad writing good orchestral scoring bad dialogue and good story idea with lots of potential but is never realized then you have Slipstream. Just bought the movie for a buck it is worth it but not much more. Good to see Mark Hamill act again. There should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage from the original. Or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place. Berstein's score gave demanded your attention from the opening credits however the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points mutes his attention getting score. It is really easy to dog a movie like this after all it is by the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and a tremendous cast but it is what it is. And that ain't much. Favorite Line- We're going to make it ha-ha!...(BOOM!)  ,negative
 The funniest thing about Fortunes is that one of the main characters Lewis (Urbaniak) has writer's block and apparently so did the screenplay writer for the film. This is sad as well as I guess by large this is supposed to be a comedy or dramedy but that's the funniest thing I can remember from watching this. Three friends go out and drink one night. On the way home two decide to get their fortunes told by a gypsy as they call her. Those two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by. Then nothing happens. I hope I didn't spoil the movie there but really this extremely low-budget bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly snowballed into the depths of hell. Yeah I'm being harsh. Honestly it wasn't that bad it was just blah. The aforementioned writer was annoying to watch though he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny lines. The clichéd ladies man the only one that didn't get his fortune told was just annoying. The only bright spot was the remaining friend the married dad whose fortune was told that something big was to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared. He was funny genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. Unfortunately that's not saying much. Perhaps I'm being too cruel. Heck they got the ambition to make a movie went and got funding and accomplished something. Unfortunately however I can't at all recommend the film on the basis there's hundreds of thousands of other independent movies that have hundreds of thousands better ideas and executions. This one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes. ,negative
 This movie has got to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst one I've ever seen. It wasn't even a bad b movie...I would have rated it at as a z. The special effects were ridiculous...err if you could even call them special effects. I think the reviewer before hit the nail on the head...it was the box that sold the movie while the cover art was great and the synopsis intriguing (which both is why I rented it) it was a waste of not only time but money as well. I didn't last long. I took it back to the store and switched it out for another movie I believe my local video store took it off the shelf because they had SOOOO many complaints about this horrible movie. My 6 year old could have done a better job filming it/writing the script! ,negative
 A romp across a disbelieving outback this outragous adventure enchants through it's downright brazeness. Comedy from the clashing confrontation of cultural assumptions - as Drama from Crisis. Perhaps a little too Queenie for some - I would love to have watched IN a cinema audience in the outback. Shockingly good ,negative
 Where do I start? The box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt but I'd been taught early on not to judge a book (or movie) by its cover so I ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if they can't do a single still image properly then how dismal will the moving ones be later? Yeah. They were pretty awful. The actors in this flick appeared totally unaware they were being filmed as just any expression seemed to do fine regardless of the situation the characters were in or what they were reacting to. However a good story can offset the downfalls of low budget productions. Good dialog can carry a poorly-funded attempt at times. Unfortunately this was not one of those times as the story was as weak and nonexistent as the other required elements of good cinema. There simply aren't words for how bad this was. Perhaps you can get the idea from my rating of -2.3/10 from... the Fiend :. ,negative
 What exactly is the point of pretending to con people out of things like ski passes and pizza? I fail to see a point. I'd not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless. Skyler Stone doesn't seem to be a very down-to-earth or even a nice guy. He has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what he does in this show. The worse thing about this piece of crap is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are reenacted so not only are they apparently conning the poor people on the other end of the phone but they are also conning the audience who don't have enough time to read the disclaimed that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show! Not only that but he also claims this is how he lives his whole life. What an lie. No one could live their lives like this and the fact he says this is not only yet another con to get his show watched but it's also one of the most fabricated blatant pieces of bull$hit I've ever heard. This guy is an @$$! What makes them think that going to all the trouble of for example write and record a song get someone to pain a HUGE picture of you and two mates get dance lessons and actually travel to a ski resort is actually worth only getting free ski passes and some food for free? What is the point of that? It's an awful lot of trouble to go to just for a few ski passes and a bit of snow. As far as comedy goes this is bottom of the barrel stuff. ,negative
 I'm starting to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young and emerging talent. Get a first-time screenwriter an inexperienced director a few TV actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do. 'When a Stranger Calls' is a little better than most such recent offerings but is still completely by-the-book; riddled with plot holes and genre clichés. The story is unbelievably simplistic. The slim 87 minute running time is heavily padded with inconsequential friends and a pointless cheating boyfriend. The killer is devoid of even the token motivation of Jason or Michael or even the original movie's killer and as a result is never particularly frightening. The police behave in such an unbelievably ineffectual and lazy manner as to verge on professional misconduct. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to proceedings that he managed with Lara Croft but his style of directing is decidedly generic possessing no indicators of real talent or vision. The performances are routine dark hallways replace genuine horror and the scares are of the tired cat-in-the-closet variety. The cinematography and production design however are above average for this kind of film. The house is beautifully designed all dark wood and glassy reflections and there are a few moments that are of visual interest. Though lacking an ounce of dramatic originality it acts as a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller and maintains interest longer than most of its ilk. ,negative
 This movie is the last straw in a list of films I have seen this week that have pushed me over the edge and forced me to join IMDb and spread some warning to the public. It was absolutely horrible. The film was drawn out and painfully boring. The sound effects and even picture quality seemed like they came from Willow (1988) or maybe even Conan the Barbarian (1982). The battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in the British Isles made me snicker. There wasn't even a coherent formation at all just a few guys with spears and horses running right through them. The scenes of Douglas especially in the last battle were simply horrible as was most of the acting in the film. ,negative
 This is a big disappointment. The main problem is the acting. Sylvestre le Touzel is pretty poor as Fanny and the rest are not much better everybody is very stilted and unnatural. Also the camerawork is very 1980's ie cramped and jumpy compared with the likes of 1995's P&P for example. The script is if anything too faithful to the book and there are some cringe worthy expressions that should have been cut. In every way this is far inferior to the recent film version which though it took huge liberties with the book seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was far more enjoyable. ,negative
 I think there's a reason this film never came close to hitting theaters. It was probably my neighbors down the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera. The acting is very amateur. This movie is definitely not something you would want to watch unless you were extremely bored. The actors even seem to double as directors and crew members with no professionalism whatsoever. Should the director(s) and/or actors choose to continue with their endeavor of making movies I would definitely advise them to brush up on their skills and perhaps take a few (ok many) classes on film-making and acting. ,negative
 My friend and I rented this movie for 3.99 at blockbuster. If I'd have known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be I wouldn't have paid a cent. I had no warning for this bs. The acting can't even be called acting the inevitable sex scene is awkward and you can tell that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it and the male villain... god who couldn't tell he was going to attack emily And the musical cues... my lord. This movie makes me want to cry. Never rent this. In fact if you happen to look upon it gauge out your eyeballs. This movie isn't of God- it's from hell. I'm just gonna take the last couple lines to write blah blah blah shiz cause I really don't want to continue on with this review. ,negative
 So I'm wondering while watching this film did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her before clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the before Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before the film is very formulaic. Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest. The two bad boy serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films. As has the good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence character been seen before. In fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes. One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer. ,negative
 I can't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the IMDb website! Have I been issued with the Special Edition naff version? Edited by Dewhurst produced by Bernard Matthews this film should be housed in Battersea. I'm sorry for all the UK-centric references but if you're elsewhere and you've got no toenails to cut or you haven't got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining lifespan (as long as you haven't got any paint to watch drying). The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted. What on earth is Irons doing in this film? ,negative
 The earlier review is pretty much on target which Altman was NOT with this film. I haven't seen it since its original release but I have seldom spent two hours in a theater feeling as miserable and disappointed as I was with this film. If some pretentious community theater attempted a sci-fi version of a Ingmar Bergman film it might come off like this. I can't bring myself to give anything Altman has made a 1 but this is probably the nadir of a career that has had some remarkable highs and lows. I would have walked out but as a paid film critic I couldn't. (Think about that the next time you envy movie critics.) ,negative
 There is nothing original humane or insightful in this film. The acting is average images are amateurish the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic...something close to a soap. In 2:37 a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspense drama. We watch partly because we want to know who dies. The various characters each have a problem and the film shows how bad each problem is for them but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves. Despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events there is NEVER another way of seeing the events themselves. So in 2:37 the arseholes are arseholes the angels are angels. This is simple stuff. Without this complexity the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence. You hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation. In the end if you know ANYTHING about film in the last 5 years 2:37 is just an immature rip off of Elephant - not a meditation not a progression. Yet while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant. The positive posts on IMDb curiously avoid any mention of this or simply don't value originality. If you do want something with heart and voice - avoid this piece of youth exploitation. I was surprised by the filmmakers age when I found out after seeing this film - I had assumed a 13 year old had made it. The Twenty Somethings I've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man. ,negative
 You know those movies that are so unspeakably bad that you have to laugh? Half-caste wasn't one of them. Which sounds good right? But no it's not. It's not a bad attempt at a horror movie that's fun to watch because it's lame or not well acted or has bad special effects or anything else like that. No Half-caste is just plain boring. They don't even make an attempt to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so. It's just kids running around in the African bush country and getting high off of elephant dung for the first 75% of the movie and it's not even funny. The last 20 minutes though are HILARIOUS. I have no idea what happened but it was really fun to watch that CGI leopard rip out the throats of all of those white guys I couldn't tell apart anyway. If you're in the mood for a bad horror movie don't rent this one because you'll go to sleep before they get to the fun stuff. If you do accidentally rent this movie I'd recommend fast forwarding to the end and skipping any scene that happens in daylight. You won't miss anything. You won't have any idea which character is which or exactly what is going on even if you do watch all of the back-story. ,negative
 I caught a screening of this at the True/False Documentary film festival in Columbia Missouri and I was pretty disappointed. I was expecting a cool documentary into the protest and activism surrounding the RNC but what I got was a largely flawed bad-acted fictitious conspiracy ridden badly woven tale. I'd heard of its neo-documentary technique blending both True and False but I expected more along the lines of a fictitious storyline developed for a better personification and to create a sense of unity between real interviews but it was more along the lines of a terrible made-for-conspiracy theory TV movie. The acting overall is terrible except for Rossario which is not surprising considering the Director at the screening said most of the lead characters had no acting training his excuse being that he wanted them to be real. Heres a hint real people can't act but actors can usually act real. It would of been not so cornily offensive if it wasn't blatantly obvious about how keen he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory onto us throughout the whole movie its especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director cameos and starts ranting on about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. The movie also does a good job of laughably stereotyping every single role it tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and stamp a big 'Good' or 'Evil' on every character. Skip it maybe find yourself a nice real documentary/ ,negative
 Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula Marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. When she's denied the drug because of possible side effects she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her. Have you ever heard the expression as exciting as watching paint dry ? That pretty much sums up Satanik. During the film one of the characters utters the line Something so horrible it's inconceivable. I wasn't sure if he was talking about something in movie or the movie itself. I'm really disappointed because I had high hopes for this one. Satanik had possibilities but they're never realized. At every opportunity the plot has Marnie do the dullest things imaginable. The writing is horrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She's not that appealing and cannot carry the film on her own. Another big problem with Satanik is the direction and editing. It's a mess. We see things and places that have no bearing on anything in the movie. The camera lingers on shots too long after the scene is over. I can't think of a single shot that would call anything but unoriginal. This group of filmmakers exhibits little in the way of imagination or talent. I may not be familiar with the Italian comic on which Satanik is supposedly based but I'm sure it's got to be better than this. ,negative
 I'm working my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the movies in the set. I am sure that George Zucco was a good actor; but this was only the second film in which I saw him the first being DEAD MEN WALK in which he played two parts. However even good acting couldn't save THE MAD MONSTER. Zucco plays a mad scientist Dr. Cameron (who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments). He believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another. In this case like so many others of its ilk it is a transfusion of (I assume) wolf's blood into humans. His goal is to create an invincible army which he can control through the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand a retarded gardener whose dialogue slows down this snail-paced classic to almost a full-stop. Beyond his experiments Dr. Cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him using his transformed gardener. However he loses control of his subject who begins to transform without the transfusion -- yikes! The werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop-action / makeup effects. No doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time; but in today's digital age it's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this. ,negative
 I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget arthouse movies. I also know that John Sayles has a sort of glow about him that earthy intellectual anti-hollywood vibe a la Tim Robbins the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan that makes him a darling with the critics from the get-go. But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry it just isn't. It meanders. It has too many characters. Its tone is uneven its point of view is muddled the acting is all over the board from naturalistic to over the top. It lingers for long moments with minor characters we don't care about and cuts away from tense scenes just when things are getting good. It misses the mark. The worst flaw in the movie is that the two closest things to a protagonist Edie Falco's Marly and Angela Bassett's Desiree are straight-jacketed in characters that have no drive. Marly is an apathetic drunk steeped in her life's own inertia. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain. When your two main characters' world-views can be summed up with the phrases I don't care and I want to leave here why should the audience give a rat's patootie? I'll be plain: Sayles writes funny dialogue. He's very adept at crafting a scene. The problem is these scenes don't go anywhere. There's no spine to the movie. No drive. The movie doesn't create rooting interest in any of the characters. In my opinion he's also too preachy about big bad corporate America gobbling up the little guy. If you want to see a quality small movie see David Lynch's Straight Story. Pass this one up. ,negative
 The parallels between this film and Captain Walrus (an independant film shown at the Team Projection Film Festival in 1994) are so blindingly obvious that any praise for Sally Marshall Is Not An Alien must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work. In Captain Walrus two young boys (Geoff and Roger played by Dean Turner and Brett Allen respectively) examine the bizarre behaviour of their new neighbour Britney (played by Louise Farley). As the two boys watch through their telescope they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However the emphasis in Captain Walrus is on the pointless and somewhat power-hungry actions of the neighbour Britney and less on the friendship between the two boys. A critical success at the film festival the plot of Captain Walrus has obviously been appropriated and rehashed in order to give the Australian Film Community another notch on the belt with regards to children's product. Although Sally Marshall is not an Alien is a fine film and a credit to its producers its inauthenticity leaves something to be deserved. ,negative
 I just went to see this movie with a friend. I quickly looked and read a short synopsis and thought it sounded interesting. We came out the movies not feeling very sure if we liked it not. The acting was good enough and connection with characters was OK. The main character I thought acted a lot like someone like Van Helsing. Yes it was pretty entertaining. But the plot I felt like it was used from other movies. The script was a bit weak I'm not sure why every time something bad happens the main character says Oh my god every time. The special effects worked well but (sorry for this spoiler) the main monster at the main climax reminded me a lot of the Balrok out of Lord of the Rings. Overall the movie was OK but I felt like it's been done already. Go and see buy all means but don't expect too much. ,negative
 The acting was bad and the plot well i don't think there was one. Some fat blonde chap who is always dressed in a dinner suit kidnaps a sort from a nightclub i think he then kills a copper. pointless fights then happen Kidnapped girl is put in cage on a boat why? Tough uncompromising martial arts trained cop turns up speaks bad english and does stuff that does not make sense. Its utter tripe. But he does have a nice car. christ on a bike this film was a waste of 90 minutes. ,negative
 This movie actually hurts to watch. Not only did I not laugh once I ended up getting a serious headache. At times I felt so sorry for the actors involved. The best way to sum it up is to note that among sex comedies it is probably the least funny and least sexy of all time. I'm only sorry I can't give it a vote of less than one. To give this a rating of one is an insult to every movie that scores two or better. Now I see that they're filming a sequel. Hearing that someone is actually paying these people to make another movie convinces me that there's just too much money in Hollywood. RAISE THEIR TAXES!!! Making a sequel to this movie may very well constitute a crime against humanity; perhaps an international tribunal should be convened or U.N. sanctions applied to the filmmakers. In short it's a really bad movie. Really really. ,negative
 Square pigs as a way of efficiently utilizing cargo space is the one and only clever moment in Space Truckers . Believe it or not Dennis Hopper has done worse see The American Way but this movie is way up there on the cream of the crap scale. I think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that Space Truckers will please no one. Too cartoon-like too be taken seriously an almost total lack of humor and poor character development virtually assures disappointment. The beer and popcorn crowd might tolerate one viewing but all others have been warned to avoid Space Truckers for all of the above reasons. - MERK ,negative
 This is a poor excuse for a movie. A film noir done by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First let's forget about the plot a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what turns her from despising him to loving him? Along with a group of other guys he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off stranding them. It isn't exactly heroics but she's suddenly smitten. It's truly painful to watch Claude Rains trying to portray a hard-bitten tough-talking noir-type cop. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool along with a growling voice. Most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. How he ever got talked into taking this job I'll never understand. Enjoy it if you can for a few period details the old cars and gas pumps but don't expect a decent film experience. It wasted 1-1/12 hours of my life. ,negative
 Even Sophie Marceau's presence and the few (very few) good French gags are unable to save this otherwise slow and boring movie! A disappointment. The story is weak and so is acting. This movie was advertised as the French version of The Mummy but the Mummy has at least spectacular and enjoyable effects... ,negative
 The supposed writer and director Mr.Dhawan has copied almost the whole plot of the blockbuster Hollywood movie HITCH starring Will Smith. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The plot was just copy pasted and some low grade humor(probably mr.Dhawan's own creation) and frequent dancing was added to increase the movie time to local standards. Although Salman khan and Govinda's acting did give us some smiles however it does not suit legendary artists like them to be a part of plagiarism specially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buying pirated discs! ,negative
 The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable. It was just one of those movies that I came across in my netflix instant queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team up together again since Bully. Unfortunately interesting never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) from the in crowd and eventually starts hanging with them. And of course like all other movies things are good (or so you assume since the movie never hints on that things are good) and then things become not so good by hanging with the rich kids. The problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It is just a dead lifeless movie that after you've watched it you feel you could have done anything better. Some scenes (the ones with Renfro's parents) don't even make sense as to being in the movie because the director and writer didn't follow up on it at all. All the interesting things that COULD have played out was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching a before they were stars episode (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from the OC). The only shining light in this movie and the reason it doesn't get a ONE rating from me is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her in it. Renfro just look like he brought over a bit of his character from Bully. And for pete's sake the Title is BS change the name. ,negative
 With an interesting premise (in the conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear) this should have been a good film. But the story is sabotaged by the director's overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor script. Yes the natural setting is beautiful and yes the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting. But the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily over and over again adding layer upon layer of over-the-top musical accompaniment not to mention a completely unnecessary voice-over to the soundtrack that ultimately overwhelm the viewer and by calling attention to themselves take away from the story. To me it was clear the director with his microscopic closeups and the endless recurrence of the musical motif of Danny Boy (of all things!) was trying to make a New Zealand version of an epic Sergio Leone film something on the order of Once Upon A Time In The West. But given the earnestness of the story (most of Leone's westerns were tongue-in-cheek) not to mention that it's no longer 1968 he succeeds in making a parody of one. Too bad. ,negative
 All this show is is the same plot. Kuszko (spelling?) is in danger of failing school he needs to pass to become emperor. He needs to learn something which he thinks is stupid he then uses it/ learns more about it and realizes it's not so stupid. Eezma posing as the principal tries to transform Kuszko into some animal to stop him. Every episode. Jokes from the movie are copied (Eezma's incredibly complicated plans Kuszko breaking the 4th wall constantly squirrels.) They should try hiring some writers. 2/10 ,negative
 First of all I wasn't sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn't understand and find boring. There wasn't really much to it Bruce Willis wasn't stretched as an actor at all. He did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his I wouldn't bother. And if it's the story you're interested in (guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child) I would go to see About A Boy. It has everything this film lacked humor sadness and reality. ,negative
 Endless repetition about the evil World Bank IMF Globalization and the Americans are blamed for all of Africa's problemsand the movie is long about two hours but it seems longer. The French actually occupied Mali the country in which the movie takes place for centuries but are only peripheral bad guys. One doesn't learn enough about any of the characters to really care what's happening to themthey are completely marginal to the preaching which goes on and on and on. There's no plot no character development no humor (except for a few pokes at Bush and Wolfowitz but that's almost cheating it's so easy) and the production values are mediocreno redemption there. It is amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching about such a big topic and convey utterly zero real information. The Irish ballad I was dying and then the famine came has more content. The movie is boring the sub-titles are tough to read there is no real content about the subject of the film and the propaganda is relentless. Skip this one. ,negative
 I found Super Troopers only mildly amusing at best (seemed like a glorified Police Academy ripoff to me) and I rented this movie in hopes of it being better. It wasn't. The writing is absolutely horrible and the pacing of this film is even worse. It doesn't feel like a whole lot happens in this film or that it really gives us a reason to give a damn about any of the characters. The actor who plays Felix is totally uninspired though possibly due in part to the dialogue he had to work with. In short this movie just went wrong in so many places. I get the impression that since films like Clerks independent filmmakers seem to think that they can make movies like this with long rambling scenes of dialogue where characters are trying to be funny. But where dialogue in Clerks pushes the story forward in this movie it hopelessly weighs it down. Films are supposed to have a decent balance of action and dialogue and as tempting as it is for filmmakers to try to have tons of snappy funny dialogue it just doesn't always work. Especially if they're not that good at writing dialogue. I hate to say it but even Extreme Heist was more interesting than this movie- and that movie was so low-budget it was shot on video. ,negative
 Hello - I normally love movies. I'm 19 I have seen many and dislike only one or two. This one though the second it finished I had to pull my sister (who had wanted to see it) out by the arm and I burst into tears of laughter as soon as I got out because it was such a ridiculously awful movie. Why it was awful: - all the cows had udders especially bothersome were the MALE ones with udders - none of the characters were unique or engaging except perhaps the main Coyote Dag - the idea of cows keeping watch against coyotes is just ridiculous - the 'funny' moments are repetitive and become simply a sequence to out-do the last one - the themes of working together which should have been present at the end were nonexistent. Instead people get the impression: Well I'll take this all upon myself and in this case I was lucky that my friends decided to back me up without my knowledge - all the moments similar to the lion king (as mentioned below) were beyond corniness even for a kid's movie and...the worst of all... IT PARALLELS THE LION KING IN EVERY SINGLE WAY Responsible father figure who is killed by Coyotes (the Coyotes are essentially the Hyenas with Dag the lead Coyote being the equivalent of Scar) The farm falls into chaos Odis (the cow though basically Simba) wants to play around and is shocked that his dad died believes it was his fault (even though in this movie it WAS his fault) confronts the Coyotes and gets an ass whooping after which Dag tells him to leave and on the verge of leaving Odis somehow decides to go and save some chickens and his friends back him up (by complete surprise of course he leaves without knowing they will come help him). Other things taken from Lion King: stars moving around as signs father figures referring to stars/signs in a mystical loving way the obviously circularness of how the father Ben found Odis and took care of him and how at the end Odis' love interest gives birth and he has a similar experience. Birth at the end? GOOD GOD what the hell... and even similar type music which seems completely tacked on at the end because it is completely different from all the previous music. Honestly this is the first movie I have ever seen where I really WAS rooting for the bad guys - I never understood what other people were saying until now. BOTTOM LINE: Don't waste your time to go see this. Convince the kids not to see it and re-watch the Lion King. Either that or take them to see the Ant Bully which was creative and artistic. ,negative
 This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957. In fact despite Ed Wood Jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics (such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER) but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing. Like a Wood film it's great to watch this crap-fest and laugh along with your friends. The film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet. However out of nowhere a UFO streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the Air Force. However later they realized that the UFO didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! But when soon after this planes start disappearing all over they realize there must be something to his sighting. So far the film isn't great but it's watchable. However by the time the horrible flying monster appears you know you're watching a turkey. First through horrid use of stock film and crappy models airplanes keep changing mid-flight. Some may not be bothered by this but with airplane lovers like me seeing an F-80 turning into an F-86 to an F-102 fighter plane made me crazy--especially since the planes look nothing like each other. Second through clever cinematography all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly it will be worth the wait. Well no such luck!! The monster looks less realistic or scary than the duck from Groucho's You Bet Your Life TV show!! In fact it's significantly less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters!! In fact Big Bird from Sesame Street is even a bit scarier and realistic!!! It's just god-awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history--about as bad (or worse) as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE!!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like. Bad film fans like me (who are a crazy bunch) will probably love it! All others...be afraid ....be VERY afraid!! FYI--You might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci-fi movies!! I am positive the crashing Washington Monument scene was stolen from EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS but I also saw a couple other scenes that I swear are from other films. What a hack job! ,negative
 This film is just as bad as The Birdman of Alcatraz . I do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover it disturbs me when well respected revered actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intent to elevate the film's subject a societal outcast. I was in junior high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news. I remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was the victim. Get a grip people. Read the history. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. He drove around the LA streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle. He stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest; then abducted and raped the women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliation. Chessman got exactly what he deserved it just took a decade too long. No sympathy for the devil here. ,negative
 I cannot believe I actually set up a 'season pass' on my TiVo for this apparently they had a good preview or something .. I can't imagine it though. After seeing about 5 minutes I thought to myself.. why am I watching this.. It is definitely not reality and some of the worst acting I have ever seen on television.. I am a total addict of reality TV and there is nothing real about this. THE ACTING.. (if you can call it that) is awful.. The only ones that are almost 5% decent are the girls that are meant to draw viewers to the show.. although they would need to be a lot prettier to save this train wreck.. if they would have more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably have no talent either. This is obviously a very low budget production with 'actors' who are apparently very cheap. There is no way they could get a job in anything else. Someone needs to direct these people to a job in food service.. Maybe they could do that. Oh and by the way Parco P.I. no longer occupies any space on my TiVo or TiVo's season pass list. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen. ,negative
 Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie. In my World History class our teacher had us watch this movie and Amadeus to be able to compare the two composers or something. We watched Amadeus first and it was a very good movie but when she had us watch this movie directly after that I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The acting was horrific the costumes were ugly (the little boy's was especially ugly and girlish) and the cinematography was z-grade. My Friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the bottom right corner. I understand this was a T.V. movie from Canada and probably cost $10 to make but please they could have done better. I have seen a few good T.V. movies in my time but this was not one of them. The biggest thing that I don't understand is why my World History class couldn't just watch Immortal Beloved or something. How is it possible to compare composers when given the movie Amadeus for Mozart and Beethovan Lives Upstairs for Beethovan? It's not possible to do that when this is the choice of movie for Beethovan. I give Amadeus an A- (9 out of 10) if anyone cares to know but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets an F (1 out of 10). ,negative
 There's something about a movie that features female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time. I've seen Pumping Iron II Aces: Iron Eagle III Raven Hawk and even the TV movie Getting Physical which featured some big names in the sport. They were tolerable in their own ways (mostly because they featured Rachel McLish. ROWWR!!). Then I went and watched Nemesis III: Prey Harder on the sole basis that it featured such luminaries as Sue Price Debbie Muggli Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. Love the ladies always will but after this I'm kinda glad I missed the first two Nemesis flicks. Well the first one anyway. Most of the footage here is lifted bodily (and kicking and screaming I would guess) from Nemesis II . Actually that one looked marginally entertaining from the evidence supplied here. But even though Price and company flex and pose they don't get much of a chance to do anything else (like say ACT!). In fact this whole film is an exercise (Get it? Ha-ha...) in oblique story-telling ambiguous characters and open-ended movie-making (in terms of filming as well as the story-line). Nothing makes much sense but even if it did there would still be issues - such as making such small parts for such larger-than-life women as these. What a crime. Of course it was written and directed by Albert Pyun so what did you expect: cohesion? One star only in consideration for all the hard work that Price Muggli Bruneau and Sarcev obviously put into their bodies NOT the craft work done within the movie itself. Thanks ladies. ,negative
 There are about ten minutes about half way through Strangeland when one suddenly sees the glimmer of an interesting idea. Themes of revenge and rehabilitation come into focus during Robert Englund's brief screen time. Sadly Strangeland then resumes its course as a thoroughly predictable and boring slasher film. ,negative
 I'd have little to add to bowlofsoul23's bull's-eye comment here. But as the first Brazilian (born raised and living in Rio de Janeiro in a neighborhood just a few miles away from the favela of Vigário Geral depicted in the film) to comment on U.S.-financed Favela Rising here on IMDb I get mixed feelings: on the one hand it's good that the dire situation of Brazilian favelas are getting more attention from filmmakers and the media both from Brazil and abroad since local governments seem to have given up a long time ago. One the other hand it's incredibly frustrating that Favela Rising turns out to be such a missed opportunity for enlightening Non-Brazilian audiences on the issue because first-time directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who are from the U.S. and understandably neophytes on the matter) turn the biography of AfroReggae group leader Anderson Sá into a glamorous canonization in this superficial one-sided under-researched and misleading documentary. Good intentions muddled results. Favela Rising looks like a TV-ad is shallow as a prime-time TV interview and biased as a promotional video. Favela Rising feels uncomfortably phony for a Brazilian viewer and not only because of its hype visual treatment of a bleak reality and its misplaced feel-good happy- ending. City of God is an obvious reference here with COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen cameoing for no apparent reason other than hype . Favela Rising is allegedly a documentary about the AfroReggae group and its leader Anderson Sá but beware: when you see the scenes shot in favelas overlooking the beautiful Rio shore line you might as well be warned that Vigário Geral (the home of AfroReggae and Anderson) is located in an area of Rio far away from ANY beach. Strange choice of location to say the least. Favela Rising is probably confusing for non-Brazilians who won't know many of the interviewees (and the film won't tell them either) and will have to wait for the closing credits to find out that many of the songs on the soundtrack are NOT by the AfroReggae Band (though you'll get suspicious when you start to hear Pink Martini of all people!). They won't know either that important issues were simply left unmentioned: why does the film push the notion that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not acknowledge the many partners who supply it with substantial financial and logistic support like Rio's City Council private Brazilian corporations multinational recording companies and international NGOs without which AfroReggae might not even subsist? Why not state clearly that Vigário Geral is still plagued by violent drug wars and that its dwellers still live in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and cops? Why not state clearly that many of the archive footage clips showing police violence and corruption did NOT take place in Vigário Geral? HOW and WHY did the kid Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? WHY on freaking earth wasn't he interviewed once again at the end of the film? As for Anderson himself the film leaves a lot of loose ends for the viewer: what's the story about Anderson having two mothers? Is the baby he holds in his arms his son? Why is he inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a Candomblé woman appear on the beach when the films mentions Anderson's miraculous recovery from the accident? Is he a Candomblé follower? Why not let him explain the contradiction of starting a group that fights drugs and simultaneously praises Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a pride-building movement for black people from favelas why are the girls in the AfroReggae band limited to booty-bouncing routines? No you won't get any answers to these questions either. Instead the filmmakers are interested in turning Anderson Sá into a composite mix of pop-star Malcolm X Gandhi and Christ (check out that last image of the statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado hill immediately after showing Anderson miraculously walking after his surgery). And that's the WORST thing the filmmakers could do to Anderson and his cause: turn him into a special CHOSEN one (by the time they show his surgery scar you're ready to believe it's a mark from God). Because what's remarkable about Anderson -- who's the most ordinary guy you could ever meet -- is that he helped change his environment NOT by being special but by copying and adapting winning projects (like the Olodum movement in Bahia among others) to his own community with strong support by friends artists intellectuals politicians businessmen and the media. If you're not fluent in Portuguese you probably won't notice that Anderson isn't particularly bright or articulate (unlike his sharply witty partner José Junior) as much as he isn't particularly talented as a singer lyricist or musician. Yet his ordinariness might have been the film's true inspirational core: to show that ANYONE with idealism perseverance and steady support can in fact contribute significantly to his or her community no need to be Jesus incarnate. Because what really matters is the movement -- AfroReggae -- not the guy see? Haven't we had enough of personality cult? By the end of Favela Rising you probably won't know much more about Rio's favelas than you did when you walked in -- you'll just have SEEN what some of them look like. ,negative
 The Quick and the Undead is finally the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. It is essentially one gigantic plot hole. Aside from that the acting was quite bad character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings. What the Quick and the Undead DOES serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing. It looked excellent when you take into account budget considerations. Unfortunately it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns (most notably The Good The Bad and The Ugly) and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie... you know they have movies where characters do THIS! Does it fit here? No but who cares! They do it in other movies so I should do it here! Maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists (first-year film-schoolers). Otherwise a must-miss. ,negative
 Eh. This is a popcorn movie nothing more. I watched this with a bunch of friends (and though that might NOT be the best way to view a horror movie...) and most of the dialogue and action was laughable. It left me yearning for a real film. :) The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It keeps flashing back to 'explanation' scenes which dissipates any discernible tension. And the character relationship 'twists'? Yeah they suck. I won't say what they are but they just don't add anything to the film/storyline. (By relationship I mean the two main characters.) Eek. My recommendation is this: watch this movie if you can't think of anything better. Mediocre at best...Maybe not even that. ,negative
 Algiers is not a classic it is a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko directed by Duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming Pepe Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience the Casbah and the characters in Algiers I recommend you don't even watch this movie and see Pepe le Moko instead for it is much more elaborate more beautifully filmed the lines are not clichéd and the characters adhere much more to reality. Furthermore the ending is so dramatic and key to Pepe's character that you'll find the Algiers version intolerable. Although Algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters. Plus the wardrobe is truly breath-taking in all scenes particularly Pepe's in the last scene and Gaby's (at all times) but also when she's on the boat. Frankly Algiers is cheap as far as imitations go. ,negative
 Jeff Speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial-artists-turned-actors (lower than Don The Dragon Wilson for example) and with vehicles like The Expert you can see why. There are three major problems with this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say plots - are all over the place there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose 2) There are only 4 fight scenes in total some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark 3) The music score is overzealous and overbearing. Strange as it may seem this is really the most annoying thing about this film: the score persistently tries to convince you that you're watching some sort of grand epic instead of the low-budget limited-action film you are indeed watching. With all that said at least there's James Brolin around to lend a touch of credibility. *1/2 out of 4. ,negative
 If you're an average guy like me and enjoy good acting good plot good scripts novel ideas or being entertained you might want to skip this one. I was honestly bored from the opening credits to the very end but tried to give the film a chance and watched it all the way through -- only to be disappointed at every turn. The acting was unbelievably sub par but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialog coupled with an even worse script. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped and I think the audience is supposed to derive some kind of deeper meaning from it or be able to look past it in some way but honestly to do so would be a waste of time. The film has a kind of crude sexuality to it which doesn't serve any purpose other than to show off some tattoos and lingerie. No one seems to have any motivation except making money off of some kind of investment deal that is never really explained. The connections between the characters aren't terribly clear and there is little to no character development. This is either some kind of sub-culture film meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute crap but you can decide for yourselves. I gave it a 2 because it is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen but probably not THE worst. ,negative
 This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980 starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that I don't get into Sci-Fi. If you're into Sci-Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. On the picture alone I give this movie 1 weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. If you like pictures like this you can get the DVD version on Amazon.com ,negative
 I found 'Shuttle' an incredibly frustrating film to watch. It starts quite well and moves along briskly until the first 'injury' (which is a doozy). After that it becomes very lazy and underwritten as a story. It was the case of the plot driving the characters and not the characters driving the plot. If you hate film where you can't understand why characters do what they do you will loathe 'Shuttle'. Particularly the last act is odd and seems to occur in a world without common sense. Also at the end one of the characters confessed a past misdemeanor to her friend rather than generating sympathy from the audience most people started to giggle. This was probably because the 'heroines' of the story was a complete idiots. Finally there is an ending which just seems tacked on to be 'shocking' and comes from the horror cop-out school of 'people are bad audience so just accept it without any explanation'. 'Shuttle' is neither good or bad but mediocre. And annoying. ,negative
 This movie quite literally does not have one redeeming feature. The characters are one-dimensional cliched incredibly misogynistic and stupid. The script looks as if it was cobbled together from 100 other movies the acting is horrible and some of the 'gross-out' humour made me feel nauseous. Shame on you Gregory Poirier for thinking ANY of this would be funny or interesting! The worst movie I've seen in several years. ,negative
 Among the many accolades here for this production there was one individual whose comments asked if he/she were the only one (who wasn't that enthralled by it) - i.e. giving this film 3 stars. However the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story and other production of same. Well this person isn't the only one who didn't like this production (include me!) but there I part company even with him/her. If you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again I'd watch it certainly - but I'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I'd much prefer being locked into solitary confinement or having to watch paint dry on a wall though. Further I wouldn't want to see this story again anytime anywhere or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel's pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo and this is one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine Long Hot Summer and while not a huge fan of the show enjoyed Murder She Wrote. But HERE -- I not only didn't care for the story or other aspects but I found Angela's squealing squawking singing and everything else about her over-the-top performance perhaps the MOST ANNOYING presence in any movie (or presentation in any other media) I've ever experienced. It was like an unending continuation of Audrey Hepburn's equally over-the top Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of My Fair Lady. But that was incident to the plot presented for light comedic effect and (mercifully) brief. Unmercifully this was anything but brief and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (Einstein's layman's explanation of relativity at work.) If I hadn't been with friends with the necessity to remain MY viewing would have been brief. I laughed though at the Seinfeld episode where Elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked The English Patient. My friends somewhat regarded me the same way when I interrupted their waxing ecstatically over this movie. Give me some dragging fingernails loudly over a chalk board anytime instead. ,negative
 That's about the only redeeming quality in a movie that otherwise insults the viewer's intelligence by losing track of time plot and reason for being produced. Plus how that guy with the glasses ever got a gig in Hollywood is beyond me. ,negative
 1) Bad acting. 2) For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet it sure looked like home especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background. 3) Terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left right and center. 4) Cool 70's scifi jumpsuits (possibly the only good thing about this movie) 5) Interesting ship at the beginning (this crew must have been watching Space 1999 a lot). Too bad it blows up so early. The escape ship also got sunk too fast. *sigh* 6) Anthropologists might find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of primate group behavior. ,negative
 As a fan of bad movies (and MST3K and a member of MFT3K) I must say I've seen my share of them. But geez! Even the worst I've seen at least had a soundtrack. As George Lazenby stiffly wanders around Hong Kong doing who knows what you can guarantee that you won't be distracted by any of that background music that fills todays cinema. Or any of that music that fills elevators. I don't think anyone in this film even hums. Now this isn't entirely true -- there *is* a sound track. if you listen closely you will hear it chime in about a half-dozen times through the course of the film. Of course the timing will be entirely inappropriate and it doesn't last very long but something that could be classified as music does occur. Your best bet though is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon down in front of the TV with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. The rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offers. Keep an eye out for Sammo Hung as a minor villian in this film. Aren't we all glad he found Jackie Chan to work with? ,negative
 How is it in this day and era people are still dumb enough to think that other dumb stuff is smart? Maybe dumb people like watching stuff that makes them feel smart. Such as 'The War At Home'. 'Cuss it's even dumber than the dumb people who watch it. There are no jokes only half-jokes and slight gags that barely even warrant a tiny internal smile. The acting is your typical unsubtle idiotic standard sitcom flailing-limbs type acting. And why oh why did this crap replace arrested development? Well you gotta hand it to Fox. They know that they need to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers. You see the reason Arrested Development wasn't massively popular was because it was so smart. It was so smart that it made dumb people feel bad about being so dumb. And of course if a dumb person encounters a smart person the dumb person will hate the smart person. Most of the time anyway. Either that or try and mooch off of the smart person. If you like this show and are one of the dumb people I truly cannot fathom what it must be like not to have open eyes and open minds. I cannot fathom what it must be like to be mindless laughing drones influenced by every little thing. Basically people who laugh with a laugh track are parrots. Trained obedient mindless parrots. Maybe I shouldn't insult parrots by comparing them to you. You know who you are. (If I seem like a bastar* in this review it's because I'm so annoyed at AD being canceled.) ,negative
 This is a known fact Mr. Seagal cannot smile he can act he can kick butt there are faint smiles no real smiles no laughing out loud and no real point of watching this confusing movie. We see an over weight Mr. Seagal as Dr. Wesley Maclaren who is in desperate need of a haircut and his real daughter Ayako made an appearance as his office assistant. Story: Okay so Wesley lives in another darn outback with his sweet daughter Holly. They sit and enjoy their red flower tea and omelettes and on the other end of town some over weight militia leader decides to make the whole town sick by spreading a virus that travels by air and kills in a matter of 2 days thinking he can survive as he had an antidote. Problem there is no antidote and the one that exists only holds back the virus for a while. The CIA are contacted and even they can't help and only one person isn't ill Wesley's daughter Holly. So she gets hunted thinking the cure is in her blood. Wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to her grandfather who is a native indian. Together with his sister in law Ann they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure but even the soldiers there are dying slowly and so will others if they don't find a cure in time. And to shorten the moment neither Ann or Wesley are infected by the virus...hmm. One weak fight scene. Terrible movie and all the men in it are in desperate need of a stair master. ,negative
 Dakota Incident has to be one of the strangest westerns I've ever seen. Not good but definitely strange. A driver-less stagecoach rides into the town of Christian Flats with all passengers killed. It's scheduled to go on but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the Cheyennes on the warpath out there. But Linda Darnell Regis Toomey John Lund Whit Bissell and Ward Bond each have their reasons for going on. And Dale Robertson who killed John Doucette in a gunfight after Doucette and Skip Homeier shot and left him for dead in the desert is so anxious to go he's willing to drive the team. Of course the Cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover. Who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film. Dakota Incident came at the very end of Republic Pictures before Herbert J. Yates pulled the plug on his little studio. Westerns were their specialty but normally of the kind Roy Rogers made. This would not have been a Rogers product. In fact it's beyond belief. The characters aren't ground in any kind of reality. Whit Bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim but Robertson discovers it's iron pyrites fool's gold. Toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst. Darnell is after a cheating manager of her's but really doesn't know what to do when she finds him. Lund is looking to bring in Robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for but has to bring him in alive. For that he'd require help but doesn't have any. But the worst is Ward Bond who's a United States Senator on his own peace mission to the Cheyennes. In real life Bond was a most right wing individual and I'm not sure this wasn't some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal. He's really quite the fatuous fool but I think that might have attracted him to the role. I tried to get into Dakota Incident but couldn't. And the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least. Give it three stars for the cast involved. ,negative
 AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN DOES THE HURTING STOP? That's what I said somewhere between the beginning and that other part of the movie that really sucked. This film nearly sapped all the life out of me and I have sat through some really bad movies. Coming from a true Puppet Master fan I would expect to hear myself say this but it's true. The plot is inane the special effects awful the sound track the most benawl infernal tootling I have ever heard. Oh! I almost forgot about the acting it was so bad that I forgot it was there at all nuff said. The only redeeming factor in the film is the puppets themselves they truly are the stars and could out-act all but Guy Rolfe himself(he is the puppetmaster)and although you can see their wires and strings they carry me throughout the painful start to finish of Retro-Puppet Master. In closing PM7 is recomended for true fanatics who happen to be masochists. Roach ,negative
 I love camp movies believe me and the usual technicolorian gore of Gordon Lewis don't bother me at all but this is just one of his most stupid movies even more than BLOOD FEAST i'm not kidding. THE GORE GORE GIRLS is about a mad person who kills a lot of go(re) - go(re) girls of a night club. A detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret. Maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual average acting H.G Lewis films but that is not saying much. The camera work is even dreadful. But at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting ... you going to pass a good time with it and the killings are just absurd in a very very bad way: A girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her butt (!) and just don't let me talk about what it does with the nipples. You going to laugh like anyone with this. But the better of all this mess is a scene that i only love of it's campness: the go-go girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists dancing in a very American way. Though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an X rating because of it's violence. ONLY if you want lo laugh and pass a good time (But only with a lot A LOT of beers). ,negative
 The film is set in Newcastle on Tyne in north east England the town where I was born and grew up. The film is also fundamentally dishonest - the way it presents the town the kids but above all the men of the town. In this film they are all stupid violent thieving thugs. I suppose I could comment on the plot (predictable) the performances (competently unattractive) the direction (lazy and unimaginative) but to me that is all irrelevant compared to the director's insult to the town and its people. Thus the invitation in my summary to the director and writer Mark Herman to leave the north east. ,negative
 I was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created. The story here is not something I would consider to be a strong point in the game universe. No worries though as in typical Boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on. Now I understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like he really just doesn't even try to make a connection. Not only that but the acting and action sequences are so corny it almost makes you feel like the whole project was one big joke. It has been said a million times before but why couldn't someone more talented pick up the video game rights to create a movie???? ,negative
 This movie is not that good at all.Its pretty stupid pretty annoying and very poorly done.I really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this film.Although I didn't hate it as much as them I still found it to be a pretty bad film.The only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times and also I feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okay.What I mean by a little better is that if it had been totally recast not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher film.Instead it isn't but instead what it is now a crappy film.The acting is atrocious I felt as if I was watching a couple of teens act for like a Halloween show or Thrill ride or something.The kills are pretty cheap(as is the film itself) and basically everything else is low-class.Overall this film really is bad and you wouldn't be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this film. 3.8 out of 10 stars ,negative
 Amidst all the many problems that make this a dire piece of celluloid is the stupidest plot device in recent cinema history. Richard Gere determines who the Jackal's real target is through some form of revelation. He does not work anything out it just comes to him. When in doubt He's going after the First Lady! . This film blows chunks. ,negative
 This movie has EVERY cliché of every terrorism or airliner crisis movie. However it is not entirely unwatchable thanks to good performances by Rowland Loken and Smallwood (and maybe Enberg). What IS amazingly bad though is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes. Boy oh boy the CGI scenes in The Last Starfighter filmed in 1984 are better than these (filmed 17 years later). The feeling of cheepnis really sends shivers down your spine. A pity this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste. ,negative
 This film fails on every count. For a start it is pretentious striving to be significant and failing miserably. The script was banal in the extreme nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting. It was impossible to care about any of the characters. Knightly was a self-regarding waste of time whilst Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. The bit about the soldier who went off to war was a cliché even before the film Atonement used it. The use of the Second World War as a backdrop was in itself a cliché...the bombs the sheltering in tube stations etc...employed to import a bit of much-needed drama. Why anybody thought for a moment that this film was worth making is quite beyond my comprehension. It was yet another case of let's get the costumes looking authentic never mind about the story the script or the acting!  ,negative
 ***SPOILERS*** A hot and sexy Linda Blair as the Witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival Witch across town Erica Barens Julie Strain. Amelia getting her husband Hal Edward Albert to get a promotion at his job at the Giger & Greengrass law-firm over the more deserving Larry Barnes Larry Poindexter who happens to be married to Erica has her cast a spell on Hal causing him to lose control of his car and end up almost killing himself. Larry finding out about Erica's attempt on his best friend Larry's life has a violent fight with her causing Erica to fall from the balcony to her death. It's when Larry goes back to his ex-wife Carol Rochelle Sanson that things begin to really heat up emotional and sexually. The wicked Amelia tries to have the dead spirit of Erica take over Carol's body and end up murdering Larry who she holds as being responsible for her husband Hal's injury that left him permanently confined to a wheelchair. Not much of a story but lot's of cheese and soft-core action with poor Larry getting manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica who plans to kill him the first chance he turns his back on her. Amelia is a bit whacked out herself not exactly knowing who is and who isn't a threat to her. Amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener Stan Michael Parks to first lose him family in a bloody house invasion break-in then his mind by being accused by the police as being the murderer and finally is life by getting blasted by Ameila herself. As he's made to runs into the Reynolds' house under her control as mad as a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled Hal. Larry Parks looked and acted so weird that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked onto the set of Sorceress and ended up being in the cast playing his part as Stan. Without the help or benefit of a script he improvised his way through and then slowly realized just how god-awful bad the movie really is. Stan getting killed off early in the film was a big plus for him since he didn't have to suffer like those of us watching through the entire brainless and mind-numbing movie. It becomes evident to you as well as it did to the makers of Sorceress that all this shenanigan's on the screen has to come to some kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and a trick ending is put in to finally end the movie. The ending is about the best thing besides Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-endowed woman cast that one can say about the film. ,negative
 The main character is a whiny irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a pity party. She loses it at the drop of a hat acts pathetic is schizophrenic and left me wondering why on Earth she doesn't understand why these 'friends' of hers haven't called her in three years. (Get a clue sister - you're a juvenile mess!) I couldn't stand her or the friends. I never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the entire movie even more unbearable someone went far out of their way to put the world's most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted hats in existence on film for all of eternity (this alone should warrant someone be put on wardrobe probation for a decade!) The acting wasn't awful but not really believable either and in the end the only thing that I DID care about was the two hours I'm never going to get back. Don't waste your time - go catch up on a dentist appointment instead! ,negative
 I did not enjoy the film Eraser whatsoever. It's awful acting boring storyline and average special effects made this an annoying arnie film as it had a mountain of potential. With other action films of the time Eraser fell very short!!! ,negative
 You have to acknowledge Cimino's contribution to cinema. He gave us both the most over-rated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst film in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start with the 'It's bad but not the worst ever' let me explain. For 20+ years I listened to the critics and avoided Heaven's Gate -actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film. Then a few days after seeing the 'Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate' documentary I stumbled on a used $9.99 DVD of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection) and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie. Then you will have an idea of just how big a mess Cimino made. While pretty much everything is wrong with this film what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of history. Although the cattlemen's association did send a group of regulators/gunmen to Johnson County and did have a list of targeted names the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9 1892 Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas hired guns who had come to Johnson County to clean out rustlers. The citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested (or rescued) by the Army. Women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from Ray and Champion there were minimal casualties. After all these were sieges not assaults-and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the Indians). And weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial including Jim Averell the keeper of a modest road ranch and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows Averell living to a ripe old age). There is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened. Fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it is harsh to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. He could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support. If Cimino was insane during the production of Heaven's Gate it would explain a lot of things. But my vote goes to 'lack of directing talent' instead of insanity. There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters). The dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary. But don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action. This implies that there was a method to Cimino madness. 'Experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence Cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. What it looks like is that he just turned his DP loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. Then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production. The final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a 'Fiddler On The Roof' touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly. After you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'The Grapes of Wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing that review. So believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980. It is a sloppy disconnected poorly paced and historically distorted mess. Of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the American west. ,negative
 Well it is standard Hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile off. It's enjoyable in parts but just oh so predictable. I must confess I did not really enjoy it but I am pretty tough to please and a lot of my friends loved it. It is quite sweet and the actors give good performances. It's a nice backdrop and the eye candy is pretty good. But the irritatingly predictable unoriginal and really quite dull storyline holds the film back. Personally I can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my life. The chick flick genre gets some bad press but there are some genuinely good chick flicks out there; this isn't one of them. ,negative
 Independent film that would make Hollywood proud. The movie substitutes good looks for good acting a cryptic plot for a good story line and self-absorption for character development. May be I missed something go see it for yourself. ,negative
 I ordered this movie on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I've heard so much about the TV series from my friends and practically everyone in Turkey I was expecting to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. Me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the DVD. Well that was a boring way of wasting it. It was confusing at times overacted whereas other times underacted. The storyline was not only confusing but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it 'Hollywood' didn't also work for me. The American characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and like another user mentioned the Turkish customs and lifestyle was irrelevant. The camera movements had no significance. Adding a few Dervishes (never seen in them in Kapadokya by the way) and broken plates -Greek style- only made the movie even more confusing. I am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it. There are surely worthy movies made by Turkish directors which deserve more attention and respect. I give this movie 1 out of 10. ,negative
 Christian Propaganda...Lots of fear mongering... This is not SciFi this is ChriFi (Christian fiction).The movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn. From then on it was all about god jc the holy bible and the devil . The ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible. The abductions could be used to explain away the rapture. The people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction instead of god taking all the Christians to heaven. No reason to repent if its aliens. The deeper message in the movie is that if you don't believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose. ,negative
 I had already heard of Ali G in Madonna's music video Music . I always think he's funny. (In fact he really is.) Just last year I always thought of buying a VCD of Ali G Indahouse . That's why some months later I bought it cheap and I started watching it. But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. It turns out that Indahouse is just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really really bad. It also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. It also didn't made me laugh even just a big smile. We definitely hate that movie. Oh by the way I have plans to sell it. Ali G was really different in his movie compared to his TV shows-- in such a negative way. Maybe he wasn't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. Just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious (because sometimes too much isn't that laughable anymore). For the first time ever I was disappointed at him. That really made me sad rather and happy. I gave this movie 1 over 10. Actually I really want to give it a 0 rating. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible. ,negative
 This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen:the first was la rupture (1970)(from novel the balloon man )and it's really a pity no one cares about it.It's Chabrol's sleeper and I urge any of his fans to see it. The chocolate cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with.I read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it.The movie promises some good things at first though then finally disappoints to a fault.This is a confusing Chabrol movie mixing elements of the heyday (circa 1969) and a lotta tongue-in-chick stuff coming from the eighties the likes of 'poulet au vinaigre not one particularly memorable work. Part of the disappointment comes from the cast:this is a distressingly poor gathering:Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie Isabelle Huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress finally rather vulgar .It worked in une affaire de femme it does not here.They are not supported by the young couple :both are bland and unremarkable.Actors from the past say Stephane Audran or Michel Bouquet(both in la rupture ) were brilliant and contributed to Chabrol's then unique atmosphere. The story itself is undistinguished:beginning as some kind of serious la vie est un long fleuve tranquille (besides a character hints at Etienne Chatilliez's very funny movie) the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards.We will not congratulate the young female pianist who after all she learned about her wicked hostess agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road. Because he makes too many movies Chabrol frequently releases turkeys.One wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs. It seems that Chabrol's bourgeoise satire has finally given way to leniency.In la rupture the first Armstrong adaptation-an average detective story which Chabrol completely transcended- you should hear Audran say they have so much money! .Here Chabrol has lost his bite his strength. ,negative
 I would say this is a background movie. Play it the background as your tending to busy work (laundry checking email etc). I thought this was a film that was done before Amy Adams became successful after Enchanted. Wrong! It was done in 2009! The screenplay/script is pretty awful. I love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along. Ughh. It almost seems like it's a made for TV movie based on the cinematography. Am I watching a TV show? Even the secretary breaks out into song. What the f@#$ is going on?! Actually she seemed to have the best voice. Amy Adams was so great in Enchanted. Lead actor is average. Disappointed for sure. This movie would have been good for lifetime but that's about it. :( ,negative
 This movie is based on a Stephen King novel in which mysterious new shopkeeper Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) offers each citizen of Castle Rock the item he or she most desires - but there is a heavy price to be paid for these transactions. Local sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) is soon forced to deal with a variety of brutal deaths and suspicious circumstances. Below average for Stephen King cinema: I can see why some people would think it was boring. It plods along without offering genuine scares and forces the viewer to spend time (yet again) with a bunch of repulsive losers whose hatred of each other is spooky. I do enjoy the novel and don't believe that this lackluster movie does it justice. There are too many unfortunate changes from book to screen. Von Sydow makes Gaunt much too charming. We're supposed to be SCARED of Gaunt at the right times not amused by him. I also hate it that the sheriff's primary deputy (Ray McKinnon) is written and portrayed as such an annoying Barney Fife-type moron. Star Ed Harris looks as if he was forced into doing this picture by his agent but professional that he is he really sinks his teeth into his dialog. Bonnie Bedelia (as Pangborn's love interest Polly) and Amanda Plummer (in one of her standard mentally unbalanced roles) come the closest to creating characters who are likable. Yet it is also foul and mean-spirited. Although I'll be darned if it didn't feel a little cathartic watching a bunch of unlikable movie characters tear each other to pieces. The climax has some good explosions. I often give movies a better rating than they probably deserve but in this case I feel I should really be honest and just say: 3/10. ,negative
 On the pure theatrical side Last Stand was great as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that while not as long or as flashy are far more historically comprehensive. Certain little details such as the misuse of the word hoplon for the Greek hoplite shield and the mispronounciations of various names and words really ate at me. My guess would be that because Last Stand of the 300 was aired the eve of the theatrical release of 300 the History Channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movie's hype. If you're looking for a depiction that's historically accurate in all respects possible you'd have better luck elsewhere. ,negative
 Comparisons to the original series are inevitable. It's a shame Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960's due to mistreatment on the part of the producers and MacNee probably regretted this as much as any fan - there's no telling how long the show might have lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson was OK as a replacement and her episodes still retained almost all of the quality and aspects of the Rigg episodes - only the Rigg/Macnee chemistry was lacking. The New Avengers should have been left on the shelf - a declining Macnee an annoying Purdey and a who the hell is this guy Gambit. Also the humor was forced and poor - granted I only watched a few of the episodes because that was all I COULD watch but I think I got the idea. Try as many might and do it's nearly impossible to resurrect an old show as a new format or movie. ,negative
 I have read a lot of books in my short lifetime but this is by far the WORST!!! I just got done reading this worthless piece of trash and when I finished it I threw it across the room! I hated it and let me state the reasons! 1.The soldier dies. Why would the author make the soldier die?! Why couldn't she have kept him alive like a good love story author would do?! I deeply applaud Patty for trying to claw that FBI agent's eyes out. 2.Ruth get's fired. Ruth (the black housekeeper) get's fired and for no apparent reason too! She tried to comfort Patty and then Patty's SOB dad fires her for no good reason! Ruth and Anton and Patty were the only bright spots in the book. Oh and the grandparents too! 3. The perm. Yes. The perm. Now you people might think why would the perm upset you? Well here's why. Patty's mom asks the girl if she wants her hair done. Patty says no but the mom calls Mrs. Reeves (the horrible hairdresser) and tells her to give Patty a perm. Why on God's green earth would she do that?! Why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a perm only to have her get a perm anyway! The mom always pretends that Patty has a say when she dosen't have a say at all!!! She should be given the Worst Mother of the Year Award for the stuff she dose to Patty. Thank God Ruth cut her perm off! 4. Discrimination Racisem and Prejudious. I hate the discrimination in this book. They use the word *beep* too much. Yes.I know that in those days blacks were free but had basically no rights but come on! Why teach todays children that word! It just teaches them how to discriminate people. Not only were blacks discriminated but the Chinese too. In the book people refer to Mr.Lee (a Chinese man) as The *beep* That is really despicable and last but not least... Jews and Nazies. I hate the town for spitting on a little girl. What was so wrong for her liking Anton. SHE IS A 12 YEAR OLD GIRL!!! It was just a crush. Like a 12 year old can really love a 22 year old. Come on! This isn't Lolita . And Lolita is a good book not a piece of filth! I'm surprised that this movie isn't considered dirty like Lolita is. 5. Patty going to a reformatory. Patty should not have gone to that reformatory. Refirmitories are for thieves and murders not innocent 12 year olds! The teacher or whatever she was called Patty an ungrateful spoiled brat. Ungrateful spoiled brat my butt! Patty was not a spoiled brat because her father and mother never gave a rip about her! Patty should of got community service or something. She did nothing wrong. She just helped a friend. 6. Favortisem. The parents played favoritism with their children. Patty their firstborn daughter is clearly the least favored while Sharon the five year old brat is their favorite daughter. The dad says that he wanted to take Sharon to Hollywood but clearly forgets his other daughter. 7. The dad. I hated him! He was so mean Patty might as well had Hitler himself as her father. Her dad beats her for no apparent reason and the way he talks to her in the end will make you so mad you'll be caught thinking Patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp . Well there you have it folks. 7 reasons I hate this book. Instead of reading this book read The Diaries of Anne Frank or anything else because I warn you it is very depressing and it will leave you really mad! The only reason it gets 4 stars is because of Anton Patty Ruth and the grandparents! ,negative
 Well the first thing I saw after looking at the DVD box was Best Screenplay and thought this would be a good rental. WOW was I mistaken! I'm sure at one time there was a good movie in here but after the incredibly poor acting and video game production values this ends up looking like Tron's retarded half-brother. The first scene sets up the overall atmosphere of the entire movie. Five minutes into it you'll be asking yourself What the Hell am i watching? and it will just snowball from there. An awful soundtrack that makes every song sound like Rob Zombie's Dragula rounds out this miserable piece of crap into a laughably bad movie. On a side note #3 most romantic quote in a movie - I think you're the final destination.  ,negative
 THE GOOD: The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon. THE BAD: I'm a visible minority (non-white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year in fact it's FAR from it. I have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer's perspective and from a visible minority's perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are: (1) Poor character development (or none at all). Just because we saw extremes in a character for example Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father that does not mean in any way that the character is well-developed. Yes I admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie it is quite difficult for every character to be well-developed BUT that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that. (2) The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I'm really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this movie in a screenplay writing class NOT because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what NOT to do. I just felt like I've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. I get it. (3) The plot seems so coincidental it is laughable. What are the chances of a black car robber running over an Asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that Asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital only to find out that the several Asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or what about that scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? If it was THAT simple why don't we throw every racist in America down the stairs so they will have a change of heart? (4) I think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I've been refused to enter a supermarket because I'm not white. Did the store owner said because I was not white? No he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. Did he yell racial slurs? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're non-white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman rear-ended me I won't be saying blake! blake! Learn some English bitch! . On the other hand if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally rear-ended a Mexican woman I won't say Mexicans are bad drivers in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead I would give out my insurance info say sorry and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the real racism. It's hidden and not in your face. Anyway Crash is not original unlike what some people may say. The interlocking and interweaving story lines plots and characters have been done before. Magnolia is a movie that does this much better than Crash did and yet it was never nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It had a stellar cast -- Julianne Moore William H. Macy Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best Actor recently) Tom Cruise etc. It really boggles my mind how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture. ,negative
 This film is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous forced USA drama. The characters were all really weak especially the uncharismatic Goya and the bad interpretation of Bardem who only was alright in his classic interpretation when acting as french ally. Just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film. I guess it was no a low budget film. Definitely not recommended. Maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money. Maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema. No more hope in cinema... ,negative
 Kill the scream queen may sound like a good slasher flick but it is terribly boring and very dumb. Kill the scream queen is about a crazy filmmaker who auditions girls to be in his snuff film. He rapes and tortures them. This is trash that is not amusing suspenseful or entertaining.The killer has no motive okay maybe hes just sick...and very dull. Maybe they could of gave a victim a story of their own. Anything could be an improvement. It needed a lot more. They could of put just a little more into it. I love horror/slasher films but this is ridiculously bad. ,negative
 So many great actors so little worth watching. But with a script that misses so much of what made the book special I don't hold it against anyone on screen. Though flawed the book was one of Grisham's only that I truly liked especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself. I also loved the matter-of-factness naturalness of what occurs in the book. In the movie characters are given a nobility of personality that seemed so stilted. The villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional. But as with so much of Joel Schumacher's work genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection. So preachy stilted and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy I wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right. ,negative
 This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor has been primed by corporate head Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate a deal where Taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. He comes back emtpy handed having done his duty but having told the truth to the English about his motives. He attempts to marry the refugee rather than the boss's niece and so begins an attempt by Ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive. It could have been gritter nastier and less romantic - the amount of time spent on the romance skews the film away from the points it's trying to make about corporate ethics. Somehow the costume design was nominated (undeservedly) for an Oscar - it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively - studio politics at work yet again no doubt. What is stiking however is the black and white CinemaScope cinematography which is excellent - this if anything deserved the Oscar nom. (It was MGM's first 'Scope film in B&W). Not as good as it could have been but not terrible either. ,negative
 Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters. We watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports. Its has moments but mostly it plays like a Lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here but they just don't work. Actually the film's ideas are better handled in a film called Pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything. This shows us stuff and it just seems cheap. Given the choice I'd watch Pontypool again rather than watch this film again. ,negative
 As a serious marathoner I was seriously disappointed in this film. Its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon or novice marathoners. Following the stories of 2 first-time marathoners one senior one injured runner and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago marathon the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is for lack of a better word boring. While I did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of Deena Kastor the brief history of the Boston marathon and marathoning in general let me emphasize: These were brief!! Watching some Joe Runners prepare for a Saturday run with their water bottles and talking about how they view the marathon is not inspiring and the nonstop clichés about achievement and feel-good grinning runners will make you wish the film were about an hour shorter. If you are a first-time marathoner this film may give you a feeling of I can do it. For anyone else run away. ,negative
 I'm in a film class and i know that i don't know everything about film but truthfully this is one of the worst stupidest retarded and waste time movies that i have ever seen and i saw NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. they are both equally terrible. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the film its not really a heart warming story and Pat Conroy overcomes nothing! I'm not saying there should be fighting and crap blowing up but it would liven up this more than bland film. the kids they fond to act in this film may have been the real kids from yammacraux island they sounded stupid and couldn't act as as far as i am concerned this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idEa fOr a movie I don't know why this movie was even made deviantly top five worst movies of all time. ,negative
 Spiderman was one of the first comic books to initiate a change in the genre: in spite of being a very well made superhero comic book this is the first series ever that added a real psychological depth to the main character had complex moral issue round characters and also highlighted social and political issues. in other words: Spiderman was the comic book's coming of age. This TV series lacks all of those components. It's just a straightforward good buy / bad guy TV series suffering from obvious budgetary rerstraints that make the action scene moderately exciting. Spiderman nylon webbing is about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in Star trek. Nicholas Hammond is way too old for the role at that point in time. I think he was well into his thirties wheras Spider man was really teenager at the time. For some unfathomable reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book which again just resulted in the tension between characters basically disappearing. ,negative
 This is the kind of movie which is loved by 50-year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in social issues - but really haven´t got a clue. The actors - I think all of them are amateurs - do their best but the script is so full of cliches and stupidities that they can´t save it. Worst of all though is the scool cabaret that the kids are working on - brings back all your worst memories from acting classes in school. The lyric to one of the songs goes something like this in a fast-translation 2.30 in the morning: I´m the dwarf of society an emotionally crippled individual. Please! ,negative
 The clever marketeer is he is Jess Franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like Mario Bava's ultimately sensational Danger: Diabolik! . Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film as he could freely insert as much sleaze kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he wanted to. And he partially understood this very well as The Girl from Rio revolves on a man-hating organization led by a funky dressed lesbo that plots to turn all men into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (for them at least) the diabolical plans conflict with the daily business of a feared crime syndicate boss played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well-presented yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie. The plot is rich on imagination but seemingly only on paper as the action is quite tame. The film is also very colorful...but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. There's a bit of nudity sure but too few according to normal Franco standards. All the characters are sick in the head so the least I expected (or hoped for) were more perverted undertones or frenzied themes. Franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with and I must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members. Particularly the veteran actor George Sanders ( Village of the Damned Psychomania ) is one of the best players ever to appear in a Franco production. Too bad even he can't save The Girl from Rio from being a huge letdown. A legendary Euro-smut filmmaker like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame shame shame... ,negative
 For a really wonderful movie you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good for any audience. Best thing I liked about this movie was the Mexico landscape & it gets the movie up to a 2. I was surprised that these actors didn't have terrible sunburn they were so were not desert dwellers. And Moses is said to have a speakING impediment but certainly not here. Even the miracle scenes were contrived & un-believable. And what's the point if you can belief anything in a TV story? Talk about dumbing down I thought this Hallmark-made movie was pathetic & I can see why others hate Hollywood. I don't just some of these corporate profit grubbers. You don't have to be any kind of religious to benefit from Jesus of Nazareth but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored with nothing to do dumbed-down & religious. And for a real movie experience try Short Cut to Nirvana a very highly rated film. ,negative
 I'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it). The direction is worse. Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the uncut version). The cinematography is especially sub par giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The movie should've looked a whole lot better. The overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an X-rated movie (Guccione called it paganography ) wears thin after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud exit. Bob Guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste. If you want a far better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st Century watch the mid-79's BBC production of I CLAUDIUS instead... and if you want porn jeeze-Louise look somewhere else. ,negative
 This isn't exactly a complicated story. It's not a mystery or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog. Claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you 'to get it' may apply to a very few films however this isn't one of them. Those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked. With Goya's Ghosts this doesn't apply. The main flaw in this movie is an absence of detail. It jumps from one character to the next never giving enough substance to any one set of scenes to allow the involvement of those watching. Because of that you don't connect with any of the characters. You don't get to the point where you care. Either the main actor is gone just as the movie seems it's going to redeem itself or their actions are despicable and you're not inclined to anyway. Goya's refusal to go very far to help Ines is a good example. His refusal to commit himself further mirrors the overall tone of his part. The only characters you may momentarily feel for are Ines when she's being questioned and then tortured. After her rape by Lorenzo any focus on her character is pretty much gone. Following that the only other in depth involvement comes from the best scenes in the movie centered around Lorenzo's invitation to supper with Ines' family and her fathers all out attempt to force Lorenzo into signing a bogus confession and getting his daughter back. Then just as things start to be developing again they're gone from the movie. I've read a lot of the comments here about how the movie didn't know what it wanted to be etc. I found that basically it succeeded in not being much of anything. From Lorenzo's return and the coincidental viewing of Ines' daughter by Goya everything seemed nothing more than contrived. Without much of a storyline no effort to really examine the turbulent times they lived in took place. The essence of who Goya was didn't materialize other than his actions or lack thereof proving him to be more self-centered than anything else. As for his art the movie seemed intent on examining a few of the paintings he did but again frittered away another opportunity in examining the reactions to this work rather than the work itself. To sum things up best the movie had no cohesion it grossly lacked the substance to delve into the historical environment it covered and upon ending left you feeling like what you'd just seen was a series of aborted attempts to engage the viewer by switching from one thing to the next without adequately engaging the viewer in any of them. You can't watch something like this several times expecting it to improve with added examination. There's just not enough to it to waste the time. It's not a case of your missing out on something it would just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good just aren't there. As for best film ever made? It's not even the best film I've watched today. ,negative
 By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+. Kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress talk and act like the characters portrayed. I am disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to air this terrible program. The Wayan's Brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon. Usually The young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice-overs for cartoons and then as they grow older they move up to programs for young adults. A good example is Nick Cannon. He first started out with appearing in All-That Later on he starred in MIB II then Drumline and now his TV show Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo but I wanted to show examples of how celebs kids watched on TV not long ago can become those who get involved with non-kid-friendly programs. It is very sad that this happens but all celebs change and grow up. It is just the opposite with the Wayan's Brothers new cartoon. It is bad enough we have to deal with all the bad people from the ghettos with allowing the young generation watch this program it will just convert the kids with possibilities to the ones who don't have a chance at a good life. Just my feelings on this cartoon and my beliefs on what will happen to our children if they were to watch it. ,negative
 This is a little slow-moving for a horror movie but the quality is better than you might expect for a director's only effort on IMDb. The camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good and the acting  although variable  is better than is often found in Indie genre flicks. As the lead Robert Field is rather stiff which is especially unfortunate given that his character Claude is the film's narrator as well as the centre of its action. However it was the entry of Christopher (Brandon deSpain) that I considered the turning point of this film  and not in a good way. A twist is introduced in a clumsy fashion and slow-moving becomes drawn out and overly wordy. On the up side Pete Barker is consistently entertaining as Father William. He's the easy stand-out in what is a fairly ordinary offering. While the first half hour caught my interest I ended up feeling quite disappointed in the way things played out. ,negative
 SPOILER ALERT. This movie will spoil your afternoon or wee small hours of the morning viewing slot. I like Marc Singer. He has portrayed good characters in the roles I have seen. Until this movie. What starts as a promising movie soon disappears up itself with the disastrous cgi'd background and the extreme close up on the person about to die... Then it gets worse. A lot worse. To describe it as hammy acting would insult pigs. This movie goes to the bottom of the ham barrel and scrapes the acting off there. Apart from Marc Singer's overcooked hamming it up Mike Dopud stomps and plods around the scenery looking as if he is afraid he might fall on the rocks and his wide-eyed 'manic' bad guy just makes him look like a moron. He isn't menacing at all. George Stults looks like a deer caught in the headlights. He claims to have been threatened by the other two but his character would have been threatened by a cashier offering him paper or plastic . This is really a vehicle for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman getting her life back despite attracting the wrong sort of man... She was unremarkable. This is not a remake but this is remarkably similar to Cliffhanger - seasoned guide loses someone in a fall conscience pricked to help out someone else a missing treasure worth oodles of money and a gang of n'er-do-wells who exploit the guide. Except Cliffhanger was a great vehicle for Stallone and Lithgow. I must admit Lithgow stole the show. Even the unintentional comedy was poor. There were times when I wasn't sure if they were using a rubber-faced model as a stand-in for Singer as he tried in vain to storm the weather station (no pun intended). Pressing his face to the door post and his clumsy manner in general did nothing to help his character. Avoid. No seriously avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something else more constructive like watching paint dry or grass grow. Or just close your eyes and examine the backs of your eyelids for 90 minutes... ,negative
 The only reason I'm even giving this movie a 4 is because it was made in to an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The horrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters complete inability to act. The lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows. No chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost don't care what happens to him. Dick Sargent was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was suppose to be super evil...he was more annoying then anything. Peter Graves was the only person the movie that wasn't awful his part was small and even he couldn't compensate for his co-stars lack of talent. In 2004 someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called The Island...I personally didn't see that movie but from what i understand its the same movie. If you want to laugh at this movie get the MST3k episode its really funny...full of bewitched and biography references it makes this movie finally watchable ,negative
 as a retired USAF MSG (aircraft maint. spec) this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the fact that a teenager could ever get on the flight-line much less get into an f-16 is ludicrous. the military spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the air force and all its members seem stupid at best. yes i know it is only a movie but it conveys a message to the younger folks that we are all idiots and believe me we are not. the logistics involved in setting up any type of mission are highly involved even in the eighties military computers were too secure to hack by any teenager and the other flaws in this movie make peter pan more believable. sorry to me this movie has no entertainment value at all. ,negative
 Yes why? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others a few. Steven Sodebergh PT Anderson Tim Hunter Danny Boyle Martin Donovan Harmony Korine Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic infuriating some times but consistent surprising unpredictable. Their names make me switch on the TV go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. Van Sant's Psycho however gives me pause. Why? I wonder. A shot by shot massacre of one of the perennial classics. The color was jarring the performances atrocious. What was Vince Vaughn doing? Was it a parody? A bad joke? What the hell was it? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who dressed her? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is a superb actor but in this case he couldn't make us forget John Gavin and if Julianne Moore had been introduced to the world through this performance there wouldn't have been any The Hours for her The Minutes maybe. So here I am bad mouthing the work of one of my idols. The crashing question remains: Why Mr. Van Sant? Maybe in the words of President Clinton because he could. I'm afraid that's no excuse. ,negative
 Roll up! Roll up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Unnecessary! Decent acting? Unnecessary! Respect shown to its mighty progenitor? Unnecessary! Yes it's another offensively stuffed turkey in the Butch Bruce canon. I mean where do you start with this film? Okay let's begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was in some way related to either the book or the original film The Day of the Jackal. It's not. In fact it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to have his name taken off it. Now I'm not necessarily a stuffy Brit who can't hack Hollywood remaking British films. Well okay maybe I am a bit like that but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. This film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive. Now let's move to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangster gets killed in a Moscow police raid (somehow involving the FBI although no one bothers to explain why). In revenge brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the US President (although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move  although to be fair it was pre-9-11 so he wasn't to know it would have resulted in the US airforce carpet bombing Eastern Europe). Gangster hires nasty killer (Willis). Police hire cuddly killer (Gere) cuddly killer tracks nasty killer. Police fanny around and periodically get killed. Cuddly killer kills nasty killer. First lady is saved and we all realise that the IRA are just this bunch of real sweet guys y'know who just happen to want to kill innocent people. Nice. Let's put to one side the distasteful Hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of Northern Ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park (I deal with this point more extensively on the message boards). If Hollywood directors want to cast the Belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold that's up to them. I of course reserve the right to despise them for it. It's a free country. More egregious however is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the Irish while trying to support them. That's not politically distasteful it's far worse: it's incompetent. It's no wonder for instance that Gere still looks so damn good given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of cra*p. The fact that Gere's accent is not only Southern Irish but an appalling parody of Southern Irish shows that the filmmakers weren't looking much beyond America to make money from this film. Then there is that lovely scene at the end where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this film) says he's off for a coffee offers to get our cuddly IRA man one then casually says Ah but then you guys drink Guinness don't you . Yeah that's right Sidney; the Irish live on Guinness and potatoes. While we're on the subject of Poitier: why? In the original film the detective is the tracker. In Jackal Gere is the tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well he just hangs around and looks like a tw*at of course. He's got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end and he only does this because the nice IRA man tells him to. While we're on the subject of Gere: why? I suppose it's only a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi with Vin Diesel playing ex-Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s India (he is after all a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a Muslim fundamentalist). Let's not forget that Gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work. And if he's not why does he know The Jackal? If he's not why does he know all his moves? And if he is why is he such a limp biscuit and such a loveable person? All this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn't be bothered to (a) think about the plot (b) have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character(c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend  I honestly thought this had turned into a Bond movie (d) give the central characters something to do (e) credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence. This film is an insult to the British and Irish killed at the hands of terrorists it's an insult to the Irish people it's an insult to not great but pretty good film it rips off and an insult to the intelligence. But most of all  and most unforgivable  it is an insult to my a*rse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish. Honestly you'd think with no plot no characters and no dialogue it would be over in no time. But they didn't even have the decency to quit early. ,negative
 This movie is proof you can't just go to a Redbox and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a try. While I'll give 'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway-decent special effects on such a low budget and at least a halfway decent script and story line... unfortunately it was only just that: halfway decent. If you like movies where things aren't all neatly wrapped up and don't mind low-budget effects you might like this film. Honestly it wasn't really my cup of tea. I should've just gone to bed rather than spend my time watching. For a better science-fiction movie produced on an even LOWER budget (!) have a look at Primer.  ,negative
 This movie is so irredeemably bad NOTHING about it makes it worth seeing. NO effects no suspense and poor dialogue poorly delivered. Oh and neither a CAMP or any FEAR does it contain. Do yourself a favor and go see the original Friday the 13th or (preferably) Sleepaway Camp but what ever you do DO NOT see this movie. Even Michele Bauer's appearance at the very beginning can't save it. Usually in these kinds of films you expect violence suspense and a little gore and some T&A. The violence was poorly executed the suspense was laughable there was NO gore and the T&A is plentiful IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES then NOTHING. At least one of these things properly done would have at least made it watchable. To say at least one nice thing about it Buck Flower is great he seems to be the only one who understands they are making schlock and rightly hams it up. If everyone else had fit that tone it would have been campy fun no pun intended. ,negative
 Apparently this was an award winner. Apparently someone had a gun against his/her head and was force to nominate Maize: the Movie. Or this must have been a mistake. This is the most unwatchable movie ever made. The screening and the editing is the biggest horror of this movie. Two little girls get lost in a cornfield and get stalked by someone who can be heard laughing under his rubber mask. The little girls run into their hero dad and then runs away from him W.T.F.? The hero dad in the movie keeps losing track of them in the few minutes of watching this. The girls obviously weren't trained actors and had no common sense to them. They were so annoying and so infantile in the movie it not even remotely comedic. Hearing them scream over and over again like a broken record was the reason why I got up and left. You can't even listen to this movie without nearly going into convulsions. I can puke a better award winner than this garbage. ,negative
 I couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a total drag. Childish humor cheap looking sets cheap looking effects a plot that makes Legally blonde look like The Usual Suspects and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves but there's where it ends. OK so the guy decided to do something new for a change a children's spy movie. Well if I were 12 I'd feel insulted. The best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing Carla Gugino that just stole every scene she was in. Sadly there weren't many. 4/10 ,negative
 I'm sure some people will enjoy it and find it powerful or have some sort of personal connection with the characters and story but from an unbiased stand point it's not very well done. The film revolves around atypical angst-ridden teenagers each one playing out a different stereotype making us believe this is what it's like to be a teenager. We get to see a bit of each teenager's lifestyle but the entire project just came off as pretentious to me whether it be the constant low angle shots of tree branches in the wind or the black and white interviews with the students there was nothing new or original showcased in this movie and nothing I needed to see. Yes it deals with some strong subject material and the dramatic scenes are played and acted well but the entire project seems unnecessary especially when it seems almost an exact replica to Van Sant's Elephant (one dealing with suicide the other with a school shooting). As I said some people will probably enjoy this and the director/writer clearly had some sort of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close one so it's nice the movie was made with some heart in it but I feel it's incredibly ineffective and when dealing with material that can be so easily clichéd to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie. ,negative
 This 22 minute short short of a precursor to the later much better Rock and Rule features two folk singer mice who are going nowhere. The female mouse Jan signs a deal with the devil to become a hit rock star. So it's up to Daniel Mouse to save her soul. Made in the late '70's this has all the trappings of said decade (crap music crap clothing and hair style awful folk tunes) This cartoon is featured on the Second disc of the 2-Disk Collector's Edition of Rock and Rule it also comes with a Making of that runs almost as long as the show itself. My Grade: D+ ,negative
 This movie is really BAD there is nothing appealing or worth of commentary in it except for the beautiful settings: Chilean landscape. I know I must supply four lines as a commentary for this movie but the thing is that it is such a bad movie that I can only say that is actually BAD. Michael Ironside is the only one who saves the money in the film. ,negative
 A female ex-cop who was drummed out of the force for recklessness (and who could probably beat Chuck Norris in a fight) hires herself out as a private bodyguard; her first client is a worthless playboy type. It takes half the movie for her to get kicked off the force in the first place. Lots of great fight choreography but the plot is strictly by the numbers and the acting is as wooden as the dialogue. Give this one a miss. ,negative
 When the budget doesn't allow for a Cadillac or Packard or Lincoln or Imperial hearse we are talking cheep cheep. That's bird language for cheap cheap. What is in the hair of the forty year old teen boy? The guy who looks like a cement head who tries a couple of times to run over John Agar and provides the only scare in the movie by how close he comes. His hair looks like a shoe. A patent leather shoe. He is a shoe head. The nurse woman needs immediate emergency hair washing. She has lacquer in her blond locks that would ignite if the production company had been able to afford lights. The monster? The music was scarier. I would try to run from the music. The monster probably had better hair than the rest of the cast. Put some lipstick on that monster and you've got Divine's older sister. The camera work and editing and plot provided a buffer to prepare the audience for the bad music throughout. Hello Mr. Agar? We're thinking of doing a sequel to Night Fright and... Mr. Agar? Agar? Tom Willett ,negative
 As many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that I find amusing this is *not*: A FILM. (cue dramatic music) It's just a so-bad-it's good totally surreal Jackie Chan stunt-for-all. The women fighters are totally kick-butt and Jackie is definitely put in his place. This is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a Sunday afternoon -- surrounded by munchies ready to roar with laughter cheer on the good guys boo the bad guys and continually yell WHAT? when something totally bizarre happens. Great fun!! ,negative
 My paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the DVD box sums it up: this film was far more horrible than horrifying. This is the worst film I have seen in as long as I can remember. My wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the Tom Cruise version. The laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off. The gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious. But as the film wore on we were benumbed by clumsy acting -- both over- and under-acting -- non-continuity in directing and editing trite writing and crude special effects. We gave up after a half-hour or less; after starting this badly it couldn't possibly get better. Since I despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments even if they amount to spoilers: - The lead says good-bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother the latter prickly because it's their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business. The son asks quietly worried will I ever see you again? Perhaps it's supposed to come off as a premonition but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation. - A huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater. A crowd of people stands nearby peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused. One woman finally says it's gi-normous! - After this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants the lead and a bystander now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape have an exchange something like this in a quietly puzzled tone: What was that thing anyway? I dunno... - A crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military since part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship shoots an explosive at it the crowd starts to run away seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger let alone unusual circumstances. And so forth... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it. But please PLEASE save yourself the bother even if your morbid curiosity is piqued! The film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (versus say King Vidor's Solomon & Sheeba starring Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short to waste watching such nonsense. There MUST be something more productive and enjoyable to do like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage. ,negative
 Here is a fantastic concept for a film - a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputy's single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over. Leave it to Albert Pyun to screw that up! Don't get within 100 feet of this flick! Holy crap what a bomb...it might be Pyun's worst yet! The crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here - an entire of an outbreak told from the POV of a dashcam. When I heard that a while back I imagined the car smashing into stuff people getting run over and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. That would be cool right? Instead we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there. The last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera just noises are heard offscreen. Stay away!!! On a somewhat relieving note I think I am officially calling an end to my Pyun watching...only took me 20 crappy movies to realize I have better things to do. ,negative
 The relationship between the Lone Ranger and Tonto was always good for a snicker but to take the joke out of the joke by building a movie around the gay appeal of the legend... oh the horror the horror... ,negative
 I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like this I really did but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics cheap cardboard sets stilted dialogues CG that doesn't match the background and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clichéd and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say Gene Roddenberry's Earth... otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull cheap poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So kill off a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again. ,negative
 Tycus is one of the worst films direct to video films that I see ever.

SENTENCE FOR TYCUS:Do not watch this film. ,negative
 I'm writing this as I watch the DVD. I grabbed for the laptop and went to IMDb during the first song. I didn't know anything about the movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good. It has a decent Netflix rating too so here I am. Maybe on the stage this worked. But I have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly. And the lip syncing to a prerecorded score adds to the strangeness. Most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity. This is my idea of nothing sorry. The score so far is generic show tune music. Nothing memorable or particularly melodic. Everything is to serve the lyrics. Which I have to say sound like they were written by a committee. Each song is essentially one extended joke. If the jokes were ten seconds they might work. These single several-minute-long jokes don't. I'm now watching the movie by chapters--a few minutes until I get the gist. Kind of in the hopes that one of them will be different or entertaining enough to keep me from going on to the next scene. Nope. Okay. I'm finished. So here's what I think. If you have any experience or long-standing appreciation of musical theater avoid this--it's just not quality. If however you're a gay twenty-something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy you might be entertained. Or maybe this would hold your interest if you've never seen a lot of attractive naked men. I have. ,negative
 Despite the fact that the plot follows the well-known recipe of who did it which has characterised all the Perry Mason movies so far the characters of the present film are not so well-developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood. Of course in general the Perry Mason movies are not significant but even for their low standards this one is weak. ,negative
 This film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making. The lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all. We have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face. The jokes are all lame I never laughed once it was Saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room. The film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways ruined the night ! OK so pros and cons. Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii looks good on bluray. Cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. Predictable poor plot. Zero character development. Forced jokes which fall flat. Many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. May all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap. ,negative
 This season lacked real oomf but as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood again season 6 is without highlights and spontaneity. This season lacked its usual Sopranos style and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season you probably would have had 6 episodes worth of real stories. Side stories like Pauly's mom is she or isn't she? was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character. I would have like to have seen Bobby express his anger more at Pauly in that carnival episode but to no avail. And that's just it! These side stories had no real purpose and lack finishing. If they are going to finish off these stories in the next 6 episodes I'd rather not watch it because its not really worth seeing. Disappointing is to nice a word to say about this season and its finale. ,negative
 Surrender Cinema has been known for their extremely erotic almost explicit sci-fi films. While they generally do very well at these (Femalien 1 & 2 Virtual Encounters) this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape. Any number of girls -- some recognizable and others not -- are in this film in all stages of nudity. There are also several clips from other films which are outstanding unless you've seen those other films. There are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things -- some playing basketball others talking still others playing with themselves. The only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene -- a short but erotic girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable Sandy Wasko and a more subdued Tammie Hainum. Not highly recommended. ,negative
 Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse bad English). It sadden me to see these movies which make Korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. It sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear Americans say that is how Korea is. We do not eat live animals!! So please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! There is scenes with the man eating live animals and non Koreans think it is normal. No it is disgusting to us too. The director is a misfit sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members. I wish America and France will stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country. Please watch ANY OTHER movie from Korea that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are. This movie is rubbish. ,negative
 I caught this film late at night on HBO. Talk about wooden acting unbelievable plot et al. Very little going in its favor. Skip it. ,negative
 Firstly let me get this of my chest I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion. What is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence unfortunately post the opening sequence it all goes downhill. Firstly there was absolutely no plot to begin with just an excuse for Moore to tell his corny jokes. Next there are several sequences that would make a Bond fan cringe for instance the sequence in which Bond turns up to diffuse a bomb dressed as a clown. The villains are pretty poor Louis Jordon fails to make an impact as Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi is equally poor as his henchman. It's funny that when people debate over what the worst Bond movie is and Octopussy gets overlooked when it can easily give them a run for their money. ,negative
 Maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like 'Airplane' but it failed at that as miserably as it failed at being a 'thriller'. I don't understand why they couldn't have paid an actual pilot a couple hundred bucks for a little technical advice. Hell I would have done it for free! This magical aircraft managed to morph from a 757 to a 767 to a 747 in an hour and the power levers worked backward. And the dialog sounds like it came out the back end of a kid's game of 'telephone' where everyone spoke different languages. I actually rewound the TIVO and watched some of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as I thought at first. It was. ,negative
 i came across this film on the net by fluke and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes. it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments. what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief. i was even more shocked to see people appraising the film in the comments section of this site. this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever. the people behind this should be bought to justice asap. today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child. even its fake or not its very very deathly disturbing nauseating indeed. ,negative
 Frank Tashlin's 'Censored' is a so-so Private Snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the Censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out. Snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the South Pacific but the Censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best with the unseen Censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms nets and even a specially employed eagle! The second half of the cartoon in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of Technical Fairy First Class (who is actually teaching him a lesson) is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing only-a-dream finale. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! Aimed at the military the Snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes crowbarred in as they may be are by far the most erotic I've come across in any of these shorts thus far. Despite all this I prefer the Snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more usually resulting in the death of the main character. For great examples of this seek out Tashlin's 'The Goldbrick' or Chuck Jones's 'Spies'. 'Censored' is fairly weak by comparison. ,negative
 This is simply another bad Chuck Norris movie. Norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women. He put the guy away three years before but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house he's in by using what looks like dental floss. Then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation. Irish Jack O'Halloran is the best thing in this movie but like in Superman II he doesn't say a word. Somehow that's supposed to make him more menacing. Ron O'Neal of Super Fly fame and Steve James are wasted playing the city's mayor and Norris' sidekick respectively. The film also contains the idiotic subplot of Norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock; it's so 1980's. When coupling Norris' serious acting turn with over-the-top musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion the film becomes a chore to sit through. The build-up while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with Norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way. It's yet another disappointment from Cannon Films and it plays like a movie made for television. * of 4 stars. ,negative
 This is a perfect example of the 90's mainstream horror crap.Nothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodless.Yes there is some violence but everything is politically correct like in a TV movie.This is not a completely bad picture I can safely say that I found it quite enjoyable.However a lack of the originality really hurts Voodoo .All in all if you are a part of the mainstream audience and pseudo-horror movies like Scream are your favourite then you'll love Voodoo but if you want something very gruesome avoid this film. ,negative

 The story isn't very strong. Don't expect a Bourne identity kind of movie. It started of strong Tara speaking Russian and it even sounded credible. (Not that I'm the Russian language expert.) Moscow had that darkish depressing look what gave this movie potential I still believed in it. To bad it only took about half an hour to see they really missed the spot with this one. Acting was poor maybe because the story itself was not very strong. There is this part in the movie where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) is having a conversation on the phone with the C.I.A. like you're listening to a Chinese synchronizer. W.T.F!? Too bad the writer didn't even take little effort to give the main characters depth. Also bit of a cheap and easy ending. Plus point is almost every scene where Tara Reid is in. Not that she's acting that well in fact she doesn't. But she really looks great in this movie. Overall it was a bit of a disappointment. Rental material.maybe. ,negative
 Odious Chuck Norris decided to put one final nail in the coffin containing his film career before going to the safe world of CBS Saturday night carnage with this hysterically bad supernatural actioner. For such a dumb movie this thing sure is plotty. Norris is Chicago cop Frank Shatter. First off what kind of last name is Shatter ? Have you ever met any Shatters? Genforum.com has no listing for the last name Shatter which opens up any half clever viewer to replace the a in Shatter with an i. He and his partner Calvin Jackson do the same old buddy cop routine you have seen before: make funny with the pimps and make their captain mad. Jackson looking like the theoretical love child of Whoopi Goldberg and Rick James quickly wears on the nerves with his constant complaining and Eddie Murphy-patented facial expressions. Shatter and Calvin become involved with an emissary of Satan whom we are introduced to in the too long opening scenes. Prosatano is a demon who is locked in a crypt by King Richard the Lionhearted. The demon's scepter from which he gets his power is busted into nine pieces and hid in nine different parts of the world by holy men. In 1951 some grave robbers accidentally let Prosatano out and he begins collecting the nine pieces. He disguises himself as an antiquities professor named Lockley and always happens to be giving a lecture where a holy man is killed and a piece of the scepter is taken. Norris brings in his Walker: Texas Blunder cohort Sheree Wilson who plays Lockley's assistant. She helps Norris with his investigation they make goo goo eyes at each other and our intrepid investigators travel to Israel after a rabbi is killed in Chicago. While in Israel Calvin is given even more to complain about: the heat the lack of restaurant accomodations the lousy drivers and the fact that he is missing the Chicago Bulls playoff games. Norris even manages to work a cute Israeli kid into this nightmare. Bezi steals Calvin's wallet and hangs around the men leading them around Israel and not arousing any sort of appropriate suspicion. Eventually Lockley (Prosatano) assembles all of the scepter pieces but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremony and call up the devil. Where to find royal blood? Well Sheree's father is a duke! She has an American accent but she is the screenwriters' convenient method of forcing this monstrosity toward its inevitable conclusion. Sure this minion of Satan may have killed countless hundreds over the years but how is he gonna do against a good old fashioned American butt kickin'? After Prosatano has been vanquished killed by his own scepter (I envied him he did not have to watch Bezi steal Calvin's wallet again) we are treated to an awful coda involving a bearded man who has been watching Shutter I mean Shatter and Calvin on their quest. You see it was foretold...somewhere...that two warriors from the west would defeat Prosatano. The silent bearded man who watched over the couple was none other than Jesus...I kid you not. He is listed as Prophet in the end credits but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle Christian reference the film makers are trying to exhibit here. Like in I Use a Walker: Texas Ranger Norris is aging and cannot get into his fight scenes too much anymore. He kicks a lot and people fly over furniture in slow motion and then Norris gives all of his line readings in that monotone voice of his. Oh what a real director might be able to fashion out of him! His brother Aaron who has directed him in other films as well has no sense of story or momentum. Scenes are thrown in for ego's sake not to entertain. The scenes when the dynamic duo first meet Bezi drag on and on and then Bezi is not all that important to the rest of the film. The film was shot on location in Israel which means the Americans could insult the Israelis in person. There is not one likeable Israeli character here. The Israeli police captain is a jerk. The cops' driver does not know English and Calvin convinces him that the word sh*tty is a compliment. Nothing funnier than mocking those stupid foreigners on their home turf especially when all this racist humor is coming from an American minority who would have been more than offended if the tables were turned and the Israeli cop was mocking the African-American cop in Chicago. This film is badly written badly acted and badly directed. It does not work as action cop drama or even horror. It just shows that the now defunct Cannon Studios was willing to throw their money into anything no matter how badly it was planned. Hellbound is surely a most adequate title. I disliked this movie intensely. This is rated (R) for physical violence gun violence strong profanity some sexual references and some adult situations. ,negative
 Horrible movie. This movie beat out revenge of the living zombies for the WORST movie I have ever suffered through. What the !@$% were the morons who made this film thinking. Was it supposed to be scary. Because man let me tall you it wasn't. It was so dumb it wasn't funny. We all know that tropical islands are the natural hunting grounds for killer snowmen. And those stupid baby snowballs. Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid Stupid. Fake snow and lousy actors. OH and frost looks nothing like he does on the box. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. REnt it and destroy it. ,negative
 Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as Zombies ) is a rare find  a film that promises one thing but delivers another. It is one of the few genre films to be made by Millennium Pictures a European film studio known for making various B-grade action films & thrillers some featuring action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. Karen Tunny & her two daughters Sarah & Emma arrive in the Pennsylvanian town of Addytown in order to move into a large house that Karen's late husband owned after finding a miner's deed in his effects. Once arriving they find that the house is very old & in need of repair. But the house's condition is the least of their problems as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances & Karen is confronted by the area's owner & ordered to move out. Once night falls the Tunnys find out the reason behind the vanishings: a group of zombie children killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago come out to kill anything that goes in the woods. With the help of a grizzled neighbour Karen attempts to end the curse before her & her children become the next victims. I bought the DVD expecting a film with flesh-eating zombies but was let down by one thing: the film is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick with the dead children being the embodiment of a curse that haunts the woods taking their revenge on anything that moves around at night (although the internal logic is somewhat flawed  the children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals & are repelled by blood wards on doors in the same manner that vampires are repelled by garlic & mirrors  aren't these kids supposed to be zombies?). The plot as such would not be a problem & would actually be entertaining but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film only to fall flat on their faces with this effort. As such a film like this would be okay as a ghost story but due to a poor script becomes nothing more than an entirely routine effort. The film's greatest strength is the acting with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves. Of particular note is Scout Taylor-Compton who does her role quite well  it's a shame she ruins her genre cred with a very poor performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombie's script). ,negative
 If this movie is coming to a theater near you consider it a threat. I was unfortunate enough to see this movie here in Tokyo. Since I'm Dutch I was surprised to find a Dutch movie playing in a metropole like Tokyo is. I figured it had to be somekind of special if a Dutch movie makes it all the way to Japan. So I went there with some friends and we were happily telling the theater's staff that we were Dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. As it turned out this was one of the most infantile silly dumb worst acted with worst spoken English movie I've seen in maybe 10 years and I left the theater trying to avoid the staff because feeling almost responsible for this disaster movie. Sometimes you get the feeling you know what the director was aiming for: Lola Rennt Trainspotting kind of like movie. Instead it was more like MacGyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat music as a score. But if I wasn't feeling too annoyed the movie was unintentionally quite hilarious once in a while as it showed Holland at its smallest. ,negative
 This is one of those movies that go out of print and are very expensive on eBay. This movie is a little-known fairly amateurish flick that has the strong advantage of being the only movie that Shannon Doherty appears in multiple nude scenes (looking very seductive I might add). It also has the minor advantage of being popular in the fetish Shannon Doherty and smoking fetish arenas. It's a fairly mediocre attempt at a horror/drama/whodunit movie. It tries a little misdirection but you can see what's coming a mile away. Shannon does a decent job with her role but the woman playing her sister is straight out of amateur-night as is Shannon's husband character. Avoid unless you're one of the groups I mention above. Now let's hit eBay and see if we can unload this thing. 8) ,negative
 An awful B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive. I challenge anyone who is a Aliens (James Cameron 1986) Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage. Cast members such as R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead Jack Scalia was really absolutely horrible. I think they cast him for his massive cleft chin. I was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set John Toles-Bey who must look at this movie and just wonder. Look him up sometime as he has done a lot of interesting movies. But on this movie: The script as I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine thriller . It included such lines as I got a bad feeling about this and Kill me as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the alien hop just before it pops out of his stomach. There is also a rip-off of the classic get some! via Bill Paxton. We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls. Even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie Aliens . And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood). There are many more major examples. So if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver). You'll have a more enjoyable time. The plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing. Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get a snack or check email. Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not. The whole command structure between crew and Capt. was poorly done. I'm not even sure if there are Captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs. In general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (like dive depth etc..). If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you. As for me this one is going back on the shelf...permanently. ,negative
 One of the more prominent/popular episodes but clearly one of the worst. A red-shirt female falls for Khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. Makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in Wink Of An Eye when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! Same as in SS. (However in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot.) This is very silly because it once again makes Kirk's crew seem like a bunch of soft-headed easy-to-impress morons who - once they fall in love with the enemy - are capable of doing just about anything. The fact that McGivers switches back to Kirk's side doesn't ameliorate the illogic in any way. Lord McGiveth and the Lord McTaketh... Why is Khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength? That's one of several ST plot-devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's throat? If Khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself. And what's with a Sikh being played with a Latino accent? Montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach. I was half-expecting to hear the plaaain! the plaaaain! in the background at any moment. Why the hell would Kirk (or any ship captain) provide limitless use of the ship's library concerning the innermost technical details of the Enterprise to ANYONE? Is the Starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots? SS is a very cartoonish silly episode so no wonder Trekkies love it. It doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it which is what Trekkies hate the most. It also figures that the ST franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie that way pleasing rabid Trekkies who were so very disappointed with the first movie which - you guessed it - had far too much sci-fi for the average tiny Trekkie brain. ,negative
 Divorced single mom in picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life. Pet project for actress/co-producer Kate Capshaw who gives a warm nicely-modulated lead performance yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in. Initially Capshaw's Helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her (an interesting visual joke) but the first person they do this ploy with is Ellen DeGeneres who doesn't play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick. Different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick and the continuity is extremely choppy. Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott who mostly acts with his shirt off) is very good but they can't save the final act which is disappointing. Low-keyed in a quirky pleasant way but it is blandly good-natured nothing more. **1/2 from **** ,negative
 I picked up this movie because it caught my eye as movie with a Jewish comedy focus - something I had not seen before. I approached this film with an open mind and was interested in the way it began. The opening is well put together and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh and this is good. However the humor soon became repetitive the plot became confused and strained and I realized I was no longer enjoying the film. I have tried to avoid saying this but the movie became rather cheap - not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up but it didn't. I confess that I may have missed some of the humour not being Jewish myself and having little experience with Jewish culture. However considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of the humour was in this film it's unlikely I missed much. The idea is a good one and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through. I wish I could give the movie a higher rating but strictly speaking it would have been better as a TV series or as a series of skits. There was just not enough worthwhile fresh material for a full-length movie. One thing to say about the casting - the lead role looked as if it had been designed with Ben Stiller in mind but I don't think the movie would have been any more worthwhile if he had been in it. ,negative
 Like many western Pennsylvania history buffs I had been really looking forward to this much-heralded PBS program that was produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. However I must say now that I was somewhat disappointed. On the positive side I believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian War. In particular its presentation of the Indians' point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting although it certainly was at time over-emphasized. Also on the positive side the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came across somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of experts interviews and picture stills (a la Ken Burns). On the negative side many of the battles did have a somewhat staged look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Most of all I was very disappointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to Forbes's successful campaign of 1758 against Fort Duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular I was somewhat incredulous that there was NO mention of Colonel Henry Bouquet the Swiss mercenary in the British service who was most responsible for Forbes' success. Finally I could not believe the complete omission of the 1763 Battle of Bushy Run that started as a re-run of Braddock's defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of Pontiac's War thanks to the wiles of the same Colonel Bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war. ,negative
 Ugh. Stephen Baldwin. I never noticed until I got the DVD home and saw his name in the credits. Double ugh. What's worse HE'S the NAME in this low budget mindless wandering wannabe shoot'em up. I mean where did they find the guy to write this refuse? Driving a caterpillar in the LA City Dump while hoping to break into the movie game? The whole plot is ridiculous situation piled on ridiculous premise. Baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for American Gothic sans pitchfork. His whole acting repertoire is looking like he needs the potty and then looking like he found it. So there you have it folks: bad script bad acting by no-name actors low-budget setting and a hero that's about as convincing as a girl scout looking for a cookie customer as an action hero. It's too late for me to get my money back on the DVD but you can spare yourself-- unless you're one of those who likes to look at the dogs for a laugh...frankly this one is too boring to be funny. ,negative
 A stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a laugh track that must be from I Love Lucy. I got rid of TV because of shows like this but picked up the 1st season at big lots for $3.00. Should bought the Van Damme movie instead. If I was a conspiracy theorist who believed that a small group of people are working against real families and keep coming up with this drivel/propaganda in order to undermine family values I would point to this show Married With Children Family Guy etc. but I'm not so I won't. BTW I'm not Christian love the Simpsons and Peep show. I watched two episodes and thought that if shows like this are popular who are they popular with? Then I remembered all those fotos of the people of Walmart that have been circulating around the web and thought ah ha!. It is no wonder our culture is a joke around the world when this is prime time. ,negative
 Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy farce about Loy (Irene) and her fiancé played by Reginald Owen stranded in Labrador when their plane crashes. (That's really what should have happened to this highly predictable film.) Montgomery lives there while he is waiting for his fiancé. Surprise! Montgomery and Loy are soon attracted to each other. The scene with the bear is so contrived. We knew it was a tamed bear all along. Complications ensue when Clara shows up. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara that they should part ways when he refuses she wants to leave at once. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how this will end. Out with all that snow it's just too cold for anyone! ,negative
 There's something going on in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me. You get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems yet I feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward. It's about perception. There are characters the heroine Nicole(Jaimie Alexander)meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish. This might seem like a spoiler but it's something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers' part. They seem to be poking fun at us as we watch curious at whether we should trust what Nicole is seeing or not. It never gets a proper answer and I for one was a bit clueless at the point. There comes a time in a film when ambiguity can just be frustrating because the viewer is led on a wild goose chase that ends at a dead end with little explanation at what we just saw..it ultimately feels like an exhausting exercise instead of a thrilling psycho-drama. Now there's nothing wrong with ambiguity itself but give us something to latch onto or you will evade us. That's how I felt as I watched Rest Stop. This film is supposedly about a young woman named Nicole who decides to run off to California with lover Jesse(Joey Mendicino)to make it big in Hollywood. They make what is supposed to be a slight detour at a rest stop so that Nicole can pee but it descends into terror for her when she finds that her Jesse is completely missing. Someone in a crusty dusty yellow truck is a nut job who seems to be causing a lot of trouble to Nicole and we soon realize that he is behind Jesse's disappearance when things start to occur signs provided to her if you will she will have to find a way out of a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides her with some strong evidence of how evil he can be. That's the easy part. When a female character comes into play the film makes a really bizarre leap from logic as we are not sure where she ever came from how she got there and more importantly where she goes once Nicole tries to break her free from her supposed prison in the restroom's utilities' cabinet. She meets another a Police officer in the area(Joey Lawrence) who might seem like her savior but when he too is a victim of the truck driver startling things occur again that questions if he was ever actually even there to begin with. The truck driver commits torturous acts to Nicole(like holing her up in the restroom and as she tries to untie a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock she receives a nasty bite from him). He then sets fire to the restroom leaving her without a lasting place of refuge from the beast. It's the timing of the truck driver's attacks that has me listless. Perhaps he just likes tormenting her but he appropriately appears in certain situations where Nicole has time to flee or prepare. It doesn't make much sense his motives which propel the film into an illogical idea. Why does he make himself so obvious? Why does he allow her to prepare? It seems I'm going out on a limb here that he likes having his quarry believe they can find a way of escape only to stomp that hope out when he comes up with his next grisly attack. Yet why does Shiban decide to play with the viewer by having Nicole experience odd meetings with people that don't exist? What is Shiban and the writing team trying to say? And to cap off the film's unhinged weirdness is a family in a RV. They play a small part in the scheme of things as religious bigots themselves but the film doesn't do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all. ,negative
 In a sense this movie did not even compare to the novel. However it was good to have a visual of what the Congo looked like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read. I would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. I hardly suggest even watching this film let alone any other films based on this literary work. This movie; and many others did not fulfill this book. One important part that is missing from the movie is MArlow's sense of how government of lack of there in Africa was forming an early genocide. Also in the movie MArlow and his companions didn't stop and get the note and wood. Likewise Kurtz' African mistress knocks Marlow out towards the end of the story which has a major influence in the story but was not in the book. In the novel Kurtz died on the ship however he died in his hut in the movie. The fiancé's reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz' last words also differed. This movie is only effective if you wish to visualize more clearly the novel. ,negative
 It doesn't surprise me that the makers of this hopeless movie couldn't find a UK distributor and then had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. The distributors could clearly see what the film-makers and the Sunday newspaper couldn't that this was one movie that just wasn't going to recoup its costs. Since it's a thriller about riddles it would have helped if they'd picked a lead actor who could enunciate properly rather than the mumbling Vinnie Jones who appears to pronounce riddle as riell . And it would have helped if the dialogue hadn't been swamped by noisy locations or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. The plot is ludicrous: The lost Charles Dickens story supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders but so would a copy of Herge's Adventures Of Tintin since the link between Dickens and Jones is more non-existent than tenuous. And we have the ridiculous premise that a would-be investigative journalist who lays his hands on a previously undiscovered Dickens manuscript would take several days to read it just so that flashbacks to Dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie as if they had some connection to it. Which they don't. I mean if you found a new Dickens manuscript wouldn't you just go somewhere quiet and read it ? The film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since The Sixth Sense but in this case it doesn't so much surprise you as insult your intelligence. If the film is suddenly going to turn supernatural at the twelfth hour then revealing that Vinnie Jones is a robot might have been more acceptable. It might not have seemed so turgid if the film had been stylish but it isn't. And in several places it appears decidedly amateur: There's a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump-cut technique but they haven't made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of frame between the cuts. Consequently you can see things changing at the edge of frame when you're really supposed to be watching things changing at the centre of frame. A good rule in movie-making is: If you don't understand how to do a technique then try something else. The real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place. ,negative
 There was a time when the Alien series was a success with even the third installment Alien 3 showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story in peak star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The films Alien Aliens Alien 3 and Predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike. Arguably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two. Step in Paul W.S Anderson Alien Vs Predator and now the Brothers Strauss (visual effects graduates not even directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial newbie's has led to nothing more than profanity epitomised by incompetence. Upon witnessing Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR) die-hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse. One example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an Alien making its way onto the Predator ship spurting from the predators chest growing in to a full grown Predalien and bringing down the Predator craft (which now seems to have far less Predators on it than it did at the end of Alien Vs Predator) and all this occurs with the ship still in Earths atmosphere. Once the ship has crashed AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films. The wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of Alien and Predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire. AVPR is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i.e. members of the public outwitting an elite military unit or the Predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions. This is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. Independently the film has no heart no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. This is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first Alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them. On a cinematic note the film is close to being dire I felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen the lighting was so bad. Through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action  which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget. As with all science fiction one scene normally surfaces as being the most memorable in this instance it is probably the hospital impregnation scene as it ever so tenuously draws on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. The directing is poor performances weak and the script rotten. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt system of film-making in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas. This is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the certification will not allow it  a lower certification achieving a larger target audience. AVPR was purely a business venture and nothing more. ,negative
 It's partly bad luck for Illuminata that it comes out after Shakespeare in Love as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art art as life and the Magic of the Theatre and the same archetypal Foibles of Theater Folk but a whole lot more ponderously. There are scenes that come alive as a play develops and gets reinterpreted by a writer's life but there's a whole lot of Orson Welles-ish ego in this produced by/directed by/lead acted by John Torturro as a vehicle for his wife Katharine Borowitz (with an adorable cameo by their son). Each actor gets his/her moment literally in the spotlight but there's so many masques or set pieces that seem like 19th century parlor games. Bill Irwin Talks. Susan Sarandon gets to be a diva. Christopher Walken gets to be a different kind of villain - a gay critic. The women have to disrobe unnecessarily because this is an Art Film. The art and set direction are marvelous though quite dark. This should get an award as the Best Use of a Jersey City Theater as A Set Ever In a Movie. (originally written 8/21/99) ,negative
 This movie was filmed in my hometown and I was acquainted with many of the actors in minor rolls. Most of them were students at the local karate school and even at the time it was filmed we all knew what a stinker it was. It was interesting however to see it being made. Most of the places it was filmed at no longer exist such as the nightclub the pizza shop etc. The world premiere was held at The Akron Civic Theatre and we all laughed hysterically at how inane it was. I personally believe it's the worst movie ever made but it brings back many fond memories for me. Watch this movie with a word of advice...enjoy it for what it is..a very low budget poorly made karate flick. ,negative
 The stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story dominates Jack and ties him up to a chair. When Max arrives Jack proposes US$ 100 000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques Spanish Judges with a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior) who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from Mars to compose the backup team. However Jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues Jack Jamie and Piece. The low budget Spanish Judges is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio they are not able to save the stupid story. Further the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work and actually they are silly and not funny. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): Tudo Por Dinheiro ( All For Money ) ,negative
 We really don't know where to begin when talking about this movie. But we'll start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that whomever wrote/produced/directed this movie never read the book. Because they missed the entire point. SATIRICAL not horror. Just a hint. Second the bath scene. Enough said. Third the added characters. The sketchy Gothic french lady and her black page who enjoys holding hands and cartwheeling. We don't understand where this came from either. And then there was the casting. All of them were really unlikeable. We were very upset that Catherine and Mr. Tilney ended up together because they were so unlikable that no one would ever wish to see them happy. And...the music. We think that the BBC producers ran out of money so raided their grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone wailing female voices and an occasional electric guitar. *shudder* Plus the best line ever: Since you left the white rose bush has died of grief. If anybody has any explanation we would love to hear it. Because it makes absolutely no sense. We are still wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of a movie out on the public. We think it should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal. This movie is by far the worst we have seen to date. And I've seen a lot of movies. Our recommendation: Give this movie to whomever you hate. They will watch it and want to kill themselves. And we agree with a previous post we would give this 0 stars if at all possible. DO NOT WATCH!! And we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this movie were involved in its production. Or were mentally insane. These are the only reasons we have been able to come up with that would instigate giving a favorable review. ,negative
 As a native Chinese I can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a 'better world'. I said 'better world' because it is a lie that Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years! I guess most western audience may don't know Qin Shihuang(means the first emperor) the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia(Chinese word was spoken by the king means 'the land and the people') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. From then on one after another all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said. Another fact is Qin Shihuang's empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people. Well I do like the beautiful scenes of this movie but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant. ,negative
 This film has got so much in it. Prehistoric society adventure romance true brotherhood violence sex religion; all depicted abundantly..without a single word uttered!!! And how come it sucks so bad? This film will make you rethink the origin of humanity. If this were the product of anthropology you would rather defy Darwinian theory and Hegelian synthesis all together. You cannot bear to watch this even with your brain shut down. And now you are thinking I've got to see this. I warned you. I take no responsibility whatsoever should you regret spending over an hour staring at this piece of art. Well I did warn you. This should be forgotten and buried for ever. ,negative
