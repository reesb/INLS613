" this book has its good points. if anything it helps you put into words what you want from a supervisor but it is not very accurate. the online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you or if they don't describe you at all. this messes up the results and it did not describe me very well. i am not just in denial. i have taken a lot of personality type tests like the keirsey temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. so although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology. as for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees i'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. the company i work for has done this and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions. your money can be spent better elsewhere. i say its only worth about $10 ",negative
" the fatalistic view of conservativism is expressed by kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states [edmund] burke could he see our century never would concede that a consumption-society so near suicide is the end for which providence has prepared man. but wait. the conservative mind was first published in 1953 the mythical golden age of america with ward and june cleaver and normal rockwell. meanwhile burke a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. what a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times. there are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. kirk writes what men really are seeking or ought to seek is not the right to govern themselves but the right to be governed well but what he offers is a lack of true representation. the author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. is it so surprising that kirk lauds some of the worst racists in american history like nathanial bedford forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? in a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate john c. calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises john randolph for among other things opposing doctrines of racial equality. kirk goes on about calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the fugitive slave act which forced federal officials and law officials in northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. he supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. for calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty although calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. one wonders if kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'. another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. the duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. quoting samuel coleridge the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. sounding like the inspiration for disgraced chief justice roy moore russell kirk urges that state and church ought never to be separate entities true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law being indeed the source of all law. kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of god but never draws a distinction. i have to wonder if like the modern reconstructionist kirk wanted to see the laws of leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. he never explains how one might recognize a law of god besides using prejudice. the third thread would be kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. he refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of god in prejudice and tradition. `prejudice' he writes `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision skeptical puzzled and unresolved'. actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for god and those in higher stations and authority. in order to grab the golden fleece of populism conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. like calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. i found russell kirk's salesmanship of conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day.

" i was intrigued by the title which supposedly links jedi wisdom to christianity. well after 60 pages or so i have got the feeling that the staub is trying to wrap jedi in christian cloth and failing at that. the author speaks of the difficulty in leading a christian life. but i say that any religious life (be it christian islam or otherwise) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional. i am convinced that yoda is a zen master; the force is derived from tao not god as interpreted by the orthodox religion(i am purposefully leaving out christian mysticism which is another beast altogether.). a better book on the subject of theology in star wars is the dharma of star wars.

" why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad? after the wonderful quinn trilogy fans (including me) begged and begged for nora roberts to write seth's story. after all we journeyed with seth through we wanted to see him fall in love. nora roberts repeatedly said she would not write one. but us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it. and we got chesapeake blue. reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted seth's story but....this wasn't what i (and my fellow nr fans friends) wanted. first of all i wanted the heroine to be aubrey. after their beautiful friendship in the quinn trilogy i expected her to be seth's love interest. but i tried to keep an open mind after all i loved anna grace and sybill but dru whitcomb banks was a completely let down. all she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what cam ethan philip and seth experienced as children. seth becoming an artist was a surprise too i expected him to join the family business and design boats. the gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline. there's no reason gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that seth wouldn't tell his family considering the quinn brothers (and wives)worked their so hard to keep him away from her. i closed this book vowing never to request beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don't want to. because this is what you get ",negative
" noam chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his yours and mine - the united states of america. he has made millions of dollars teaching lecturing selling his books and investing. his world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved. his infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own jewish ethnicity and the u.s. in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the united states. he has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of american foreign policy. he goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism when he always ranks the u.s. and israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now and even in history. his distrust of any authority benign or otherwise is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the underdog even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as al queda or hezbollah. yet since 1955 hypocrite chomsky has worked for the overdog massachusetts institute of technology which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of war and mass destruction and continues to this very day. chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the united states and the jewish state. if he were not so attached to the freedom of making money earning the adulation of the american left and freedom to express himself he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in north korea iran or syria. let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much the united states of america. god bless america which will continue to give chomsky the right to speak teach and make lots of money. raybo ",negative
" i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery. i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure but was very disappointed in this outing. the characters were one-dimensional. after discovering who the bad guys were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification. sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters. ...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours. even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted. i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little ",negative
" heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention. unfortunately these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere. this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein's final books. we are also treated to some of heinlein's stock characters dirty old men horny female computers naked adolescent girls and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips. without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed. as if this isn't enough heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing. in spite of all their cameo appearances this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout. heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people especially boys. this novel as well as most of heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption ",negative

" once upon a time i was given a vanity-published book to review. it was an illogical mess full of breathtaking non-sequiturs. while reading iron john i couldn't help thinking of it. the vanity book however was at least entertaining. john eldredge refers to iron john liberally in his book wild at heart and because i considered that a ringing endorsement i purchased a copy. i can't tell you what a chore it has been to finally finish reading it. the hardest part was not flinging it away in disgust about 17 times. it's one thing to write a rambling tome full of obscure references; it's another to publish it. that people can slog through it and call it profound and important is baffling; what's even more mind-boggling is that people claim that this book spoke to them. i think it's a case of i'd better say i understand it or people will think i'm not erudite. well let me be erudite about it: iron john is a big steaming pile of new age crapola. don't say i didn't warn you ",negative
" how can a best-selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? one answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon. simon and the raccoons; simon on the failing american economy; simon attempting to reproduce american accents. this is a cd set for avoiding ",negative
" i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters. he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for the swede without letting us know who the swede really is. roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration. it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times ",negative

" i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in 2001 then it was a mere idea. from that time on until august 20th 2002 i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time. i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: let freedom ring with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover patriot that he is but also a flag. i loved it couldn't be more happy. well the day of the book's release i took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life) and rushed to get this book. it looked better than i ever imagined. with the flag on the cover and the title of let freedom ring i thought finally technology has caught up to our patriotism. i expected a book filled with flags flags with sound effects. maybe some firework sound effects. boy was i wrong. i opened the book only to the colors black and white. no red. no blue. no stars and stripes. i quickly turned the pages looking searching for flags. i found none no sound effects either no fireworks. at that point i went into a 4 year long depression. i nearly committed suicide at several points. it's only now that i can bring myself to review this man's book patriot that he is. i say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. there are no flags no stars and stripes no fireworks no sound effects. i have since recovered but only because of old stars and stripes. i went back to teaching last year not fully recovered and my colleagues knowing how much i love america and the stars and stripes suggested i have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made. the methodoloy was simple: a book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest. we found some very good books and they did cheer me up. the one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called president jesus: how jesus wrote the constitution freed the slaves and won world war ii. its published by a small church in texas. i was very proud of my students for finding it. it has brought countless joy to my life. along with the book made entirely out of a flag with flag pictures and written in blue and red ink you get a giant flag. i'm not sure of the dimensions but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. i've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. people even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house. now i often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time smiling.

" the book jacket for the ruins offers a can't-miss premise: a group of post-grad american tourists at play in mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger. it's the stuff of great summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach. but 319 pages later the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket. almost immediately you'll notice that smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting. however despite the endless stream of words his descriptions are often threadbare. plus there are no chapter breaks which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue. next the characters themselves begin to fall flat. there are only really two couples to keep track of and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them. there is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it. smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts. this seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam. by the end of the book the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them. and for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as mayan mythology or archeological lore forget it. aside from language barriers with the locals there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the rocky mountains the saharan desert or anywhere else. the danger posed has nothing to do with mexico archeology or mythology at all. ah yes the danger posed. well i can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is. the numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right. suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do) it's a real eye-roller as if to say i read this many pages for this?. by the time the story concludes it's more irritating than suspenseful. the characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them. eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action but even aside from being misdirected it's too little too late. this book could have been an adventure a supernatural thriller a survival tale or a horror screenplay. it could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress: some take the lead even enjoying the challenge while others whither into a shell of hopelessness. but none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.

" this book is offensive to at least one of the two genders though it's hard to say which. it suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot more or less. whether that's more insulting to the male brain or the female body i'm not sure but the book portrays neither gender realistically. i like heinlein and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass and it's not even particularly good at being that. the gender-swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so but heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo-enlightened erotica instead of literature. more's the pity ",negative

" first of all i did not exactly 'read' this biography. instead i purchased the cd version which i distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (i have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way and still been able to read many more technology related books). i had great expectations from this book having recently enjoyed three biographies of lincoln. i have to confess that i was sorely disapointed. i found the research of mr mccullough to lack the kind of details that i have enjoyed in biographies from walter isaacson richard carwardine or doris goodwin. i do not seek a beautiful story in a biography but rather a reliable source of facts that i can use to form my own opinion of a character. in this context i find mr mccullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of john adams and his contribution to america. i also enjoy direct quotes from letters speaches autobiographies as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period the relationships to contemporary characters ...) surounding a promonent figure. usage of the english language in politics has dramatically evolved since mr adams' time and i missed 'hearing' the voice of john adams. instead this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. finally having read other biographies of the founding fathers i was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between adams and franklin. all in all my lasting impression is that mr mccullough did a great job at bringing john adams and the early american revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. had i known that i might have passed on this biography and instead explore mr mccullough's fictional work ",negative

" i was expecting this book to be a great story but very disappointed. i cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is. the book is insipid and dull has no flow no story or no plot. let me present an example. i have read many insightful newsweek articles by a writer allan sloan. for example sloan describes a sprint merger event in this way if talk is getting cheaper why did mci worldcom pay $115 billion to buy sprint? the once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world. can regulators handle the complex new order..... it has a clear logical axis and has a force to attract readers into it. but jeter describes it like this the merger announcement of worldcom and sprint spurred building activity around worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity. the real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit..... it always presents off-center trivial detail which makes a reader bored. 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact like the merger of company a & b raised the stock to $x etc. there is no insight here. but unfortunately unlike enron scandal there is no other book that centered on the worldcom scandal. you would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in newsweek or business week if you have lexisnexis or ebiscohost.

" ethan mordden's editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book. this is the worst of his books on the various decades of the broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs. his political ramblings (often just slightly right of ann coulter and making as much sense) seep through the book dragging it down. the french people are slammed a number of times along with the aclu burt lancaster (apparently according to ethan a good friend of stalin) and the left in general while the author defends bush (and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre). the author's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man all over the page in search of a target any target. it is often hard to stomach. the truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that it can actually make one want to look at the work again. an editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public. the author is capable of better work ",negative
" the scientific method applied to this book: 1) form a hypothesis: great managers do something differently than mediocre managers. 2) conduct an experiment: interview 80000 managers. 3) analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) draw conclusions: write this book. with the exception of the 12 questions the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study. they make several insightful statements such as many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes. however they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement. did 90% of the managers interviewed state this? did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did? does many managers mean 100 managers? 100 managers seems like many managers at first but considering 80000 were interviewed i 100 managers is a negligible amount. the entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study. it seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently the authors found almost no common trends. however since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study they needed something to show for it and wrote this book. if buckingham and coffman didn't claim this book was a result of the largest study of its kind i would say it offers some decent advice; however since it does make this claim i wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.

" this book was on a very interseting topic. the author took time in studying this topic. it was about the impending world oil shortage. that is the time when we the world will run out of oil. it tells you about hubbert's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. then they talk about where oil is. they also talk about drilling for oil. they say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil. sometimes it will take even more time then that. then they talk about the size of oil fields. they also reexamine hubbert's analysis later on in the book. rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future. they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases. they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have. hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told everybody. the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about. i wouldn't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage. i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring. when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring. i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book ",negative

" john updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading. but his novels have from the very first been precious over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation. when he writes fiction he's like a dog doing tricks for reward. and certainly the rewards have come. but for readers outside the us at least it's all a little mystifying. john cheever was a far better writer yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by americans as the lesser canon. time will correct this mistake no doubt but in the meantime updike pours out ever more cloying and over-heated work like this. if i still have your attention let me recommend the 'collected stories' of john cheever. updike could only dream of writing prose like that.

" the setting of this book is beautiful exotic and interesting. the author unfortunately does nothing to take advantage of this. i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award. it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year -- which i doubt. the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else as far as i am concerned. i can't imagine it being done worse! tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes one after another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. i felt completely detached from all of the characters. i didn't feel like i gained any understanding of who they were and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. another thing that completely irritated me were tuck's sexual references. throughout the novel tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest for example). these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all they did was gross me out. they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story. i don't know what tuck was trying to do in this novel. i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level: it is not entertaining. it is not profound. it is not educational. it is not beautiful. at only 248 pages i can't say it was even a quick read. utterly forgettable once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it.

" i like evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the stephanie plum and joe morelli relationship sustained through 12 books so far being a case in point. but full scoop was actually a trial to get through. i could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted evanovich's comedic rhythm. the whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what i have come to expect from evanovich. the silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? the least forgivable of the sins committed in full scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between maggie and zack. none at all. so it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller ",negative

" i didn't know why i chose to read this book. anyway it was disappointing really. the book was slow and it was too long for a story of its type. i mean i think the book could go on without some of the parts. when i was reading it i only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. i thought the plot was shallow but taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. he kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! he was a coward. if you don't believe me go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise. he was acting really immature! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish. it really sucked. and yes i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. and what did i find? nothing. oh what a waste. it's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like. if it hadn't been for my hrr (home reading report) i wouldn't have finished reading this at all. i guess i'm saying this because i'm not into this genre. love stories are fine but this one... nah ",negative

" i loved the earlier nevada barr mysteries with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers. i wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts but still hadn't given up on her. now i'm not so sure. this latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. the idea that they were from a polygamous mormon sect was a red herring. perhaps it was barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. the scenes where anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. each scene was more disturbing the one before it. i found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. but i have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out. i wish i could say that i would read another nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. but after reading this disturbing somewhat convoluted story i would think twice. if i did pick up another anna pigeon novel i'd make sure i had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. i would certainly not stick with it to the end.

" just wanted to quickly say i haven't finished it yet i am only on page 20 but already this book seems very overrated. the author dives straight in talking about going beyond the five senses to achieve spiritual consciousness but this is nothing new and we are not even given any background on how the author developed his views. instead he strides arrogantly forward as though he is the ultimate conclusive authority on spirituality and it's very aloof and actually not an enlightened approach at all! i've just started the chapter on karma and it's really starting to smell like just another mish mash of other people's opinions clothed as quasi-originality. it looks like i'm going to continue reading with a very cautious vetting attitude toward the text. the fact that this was a bestseller only serves to show how genuinely interested people are to develop their spiritual consciousness - and how easily authors such as zukav can cash in on their hopes and fears. hey that's the material world for you!

" the author is a journalist but he seems straight out of the chamber of commerce or a right-wing think tank. like business elites the author basically does not particularly like democracy. in his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. he is a proponent of constitutional liberalism based on laws rights especially property rights separation of powers with much of that power being held in unelected bodies and most of all free-market capitalism. he finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. his low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. most in the west do care. rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment. though the author's real target is us society he looks at the results of democracy over the world. and of course he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. a country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. but it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the us. in the us the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. in actuality he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. in this era elites in finance business law banking health care various media etc have likewise been swept up in fact are the driving force in a money-first culture. he contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. it is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. the actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the wal-mart juggernaut. he especially decries direct citizen actions. he is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. however he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. it's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century and their heirs should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of congress to accumulate vast sums. if citizens had actually been democratically empowered such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. the theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as american as apple pie. his view that such unelected bodies as the supreme court and the federal reserve board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? no rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy not buttressed it. if the author put journalism first instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process actually foiling democracy. first and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system distorting and muting all challenging ideas. it is not surprising that americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements worker visa programs massive immigration out-of-control energy policies broken health care systems huge cutbacks in various safety net programs massive redistribution of wealth upwards the gutting of our manufacturing base etc. the list could go on. informed empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. the us most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy but is in the throes of democratic failure which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. this is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore. it is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule even anti-democratic generals if need be. the book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.

" the author makes a couple of valuable points. first any long-term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent secular (i.e. indefinitely long) bear markets. most leading investment advisors recommend a buy and hold strategy but this only works during predominately bull market periods. most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market which is anomalous in historical terms. the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that buy and hold doesn't always provide the best returns. obviously then it's better to pull out during the bear markets but that's easier said than done. the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets including p/e ratio interest and inflation rates and gdp. the problem is that those characteristics don't always correlate with market performance. for example this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market. well if you heeded his advice you would have missed the bull market of 2004 2005 and early 2006 especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks. even with high p/e ratios a bull market can continue for several years: witness the late 90s. it's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis. there is so much volatility on a daily weekly monthly and yearly basis that's it's impossible to know when the market has switched directions. by the time that it is apparent it's too late to profit. even in the midst of great bull markets there might be week month or even year-long downturns. the author says nothing about individual stock picking beyond a general value approach. the book is all about big picture long term trends. another problem is that the author's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900. but the market (and economy) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s 50s 60s and 70s. as they say past performance does not predict future returns. the investment advice provided here is not useful. he suggests a portfolio of hedge funds ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500k. he also recommends a bond ladder an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations. i don't need to spend $25 and five hours reading to learn that! one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations. volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for. most studies just average the returns across years but that doesn't reflect real returns. let's say you invest $100k into a stock that returns 35% the first year and -15% the second. your average return should be 10% a year right? wrong. at the end of the first year you have 135k. minus 15% the second year leaves you with 115k total equal to 7% a year compounded. if you had received 10% a year compounded your final total would be over 121k. that's 6k difference in just 2 years and the volatility costs add up. the book is very poorly written plodding sooooo boring with tons of repetition. just as an example the graph showing the y curve relationship between p/e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times.

" the amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives. i had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948. i am not questioning mosley's portrayal of racism. however i did a little research into just how violent place los angeles was in 1948 and the answer is not very. there may have been poverty racism alcholism but l.a. county seemed pretty safe; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find 1827! mosley may have been more familiar with l.a. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way. throw in speakeasies gangsters hijacking liquor trucks and one gets the impression that mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928. i am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate. but many many people hail mosley for depicting a dark side of life/era/place that had not been shown before. from what i can tell he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s (i guess those years average to be about 1948). mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation. however i doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic and i hope readers realize that it is not. easy rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak but unfortunately large group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting. a detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect; that is interesting to read. detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via confession. easy does solve one of the murders on his own but just about everything he solves is simply confessed to him. i find that extremely dissatisfying. mosley has packed the book with violence but seems to know very little about violence himself. none of the fights are well described. easy for being a self-professed killing machine can't actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them. they are either big or they are small. he does not come of as being hard-boiled but rather a pathetic braggart mosley does show signs of being a very good writer. but i think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional. i imagine that his work must have improved but this effort is nothing to get exceited over. and again i don't obsess over accuracy but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel.

" i wonder if jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel. one cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a tom clancy or john d. macdonald style just because that's what film-going audiences like. i do not think this is a bad thing but i like some of the reviewers here are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i.e. macdonald's &quot;cape fear&quot; or use that tired native american romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof. as for her writing style she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown. what we're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the walker parents davy his fiancee and to some extent lani who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding medicine woman. her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged. the men in this novel just weren't credible when they spoke. i kept seeing jance speaking for them. so we're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for hollywood to call and possibly star penelope cruz as lani walker. what's the tohono o'otham word for &quot;2 thumbs down?&quot ",negative

" gary zukav states in his introduction i had never studied physics. in fact i didn't like science and i had no mathematical aptitude. on opra (tv) he admitted that he does not have a tv which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth. i noticed that some reviewers refer to the new physics is that like new age or voodoo physics? 90% of the matter must be missing from this book. or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. he even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose. many people say they did not understand physics until this book; surprises you still do not. you now know what zukav wished physics was. take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. and the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats. at least get it straight before mixing it up. try reading some of these: the ascent of man by jacob bronowski. the book available everywhere the dvd's available from the uk. the upanishads by eknath easwaran (editor) michael n. nagler (photographer) or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion. then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: the tao of physics: an exploration of the parallels between modern physics and eastern mysticism by fritjof capra. also on the fringe but not as radical as zukav is a series called what the bleep.

" [the above is an actual quote from the book] i don't usually read romances but got this one at the library. i thought: thriller. hijacked plane navy seal...all the right stuff. and the beginning was promising. stan fixes everything and has a human side to him that was compelling. then the plot hit the fan! as a thriller it stunk. the highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly as an after thought. the romantic tension between the protagonists was forced and irritating. the dialogue is mundane. the message that horniness leads to true romantic (sam and alyssa) love is rubbish. the only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl and i think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed. the historic (wwii) componant was interesting. but overall i kept asking who the audience is for this book. not lovers of thrillers like me--and i wonder do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether teri will ever tell sam that she loves him!

" i ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who's who of public school using this format. nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a christian book espousing christian dogma and assumptions. i'm surprised this is acceptable for use by government funded public schools. furthermore there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition. i'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising. some of the parenting tips are common sense that i didn't think needed to be reiterated. a person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down. i was looking for more than that. the advertising led me to believe that the book would be about language manipulation how to speak more effectively with children to ease the learning process. there is false logic in some of the parental mistakes. an example is always attributing hovering parents to ego issues that a parent needs to be needed. some hovering parents are survivors of abuse and can't see the lines between normal risks and when a child is in real danger. false assumptions leads to false conclusions. i gave this 2 stars with the thought that someone who is so out of the loop and a danger to their child may read this book-at least could adopt some common sense. but it isn't helping my family.

" i found this book at a thrift store for 25 cents. i flipped though it and it looked dated but interesting so i decided to get it. as other reviewers mention it is dated -- but you gotta know that up front when you get it. it's published in 1986 when there were no (well almost no) home computers. so you have to accept up front that it's talking about organizing papers using more papers -- but that's something we still all got to do occasionally. so it's a system of notepads file folders etc. it does help you try to understand why you want to keep papers etc and what you can do about it. however it does get overly complex and really doesn't seem applicable in today's world where there are far fewer homemakers who spend time organizing sewing and recipe files as this book seems to be focused on. finally i have to mention that it was the continual religion-related references that put me off to the book in the end. others who are comfortable with this may not even notice it but for me i felt i was being preached to a bit too much to find it tolerable. just my personal taste; i'm sure some others will disagree with this judgement but i have to admit after enough casual religion references tossed randomly throughout the text i gave up on the book and put it in the recycle bin ",negative
" before i bought the pasajes series i was relieved to see the (then) mostly positive reviews. however i really feel like the overall review score of 4.5 stars is very very misleading. i would not in good faith be able to recommend this series of books for learning spanish. this series of books was very confusing and extremely difficult to work with. some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish: 1) the concepts are not clearly explained (they invented a new english word for one) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary/concepts to feel confident using them. 2) frequently new words phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else via a footnote with no further explaination provided!! this is super frustrating and distracting! 3) using this series of books is very cumbersome the books are not well coordinated with one another and do not appear to reinforce each other's concepts or vocabulary. i'm very sorry but these books are just terrible and 4.5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books... using this series of books has taken all the fun out of learning spanish which i used to enjoy. if you have the option to use different books take it ",negative

" a generation before there was a left behind there was the late great planet earth by hal lindsey and c. c. carlson. this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america. a phemomenal best seller it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry. for many christians their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. a generation later many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated. so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? well while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other prophecy pundits. while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book. part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. for lahaye and jerry b. jenkins it was the pulp novel. back in 1970 lindsay and c. c. carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. like most books of this type (e.g. the bermuda triangle chariots of the gods? the philadelphia experiment the population bomb) it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. like most of these books it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. like most of these books it is laughable in retrospect. if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. after all it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories distrust of any traditional authority and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age a ufo invasion a famine around the corner and california falling into the pacific ocean the authors' claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy. however in the intervening years the revisions of this book just kept piling up. make a bad prediction? no problem edit the book with the old gaffes removed add a few trendier predictions and release it as a new book. lindsey now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book the 1980's: countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief). well that didn't pan out so he then jumped on the y2k bandwagon (another of his books was planet earth 2000 a.d.: will mankind survive?). oops wrong again. first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam (a more recent book is the everlasting hatred: the roots of jihad). when one bogeyman falls he is quick to insert a new one in its place. between the failed predictions the hilarious misreadings of the original languages the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies right before our eyes it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the left behind series of novels. if you can find a copy of the original version from 1970 it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night. however for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy it is best to pass. for all its success as a cultural marker its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil. for this its original purpose the late great planet earth is completely worthless.

" i recently read robert monroe's first book journeys out of body and found it to be a disappointment - it was just weird. as i noted in my review of that book i had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound for which he is allegedly noted. as i purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read i thought i'd give it a try. the book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his research and i thought that perhaps this book might actually have some real substance. that belief; however quickly disappeared. by the time i had reached the half-way point in the book nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish. how does total garbage like this manage to get printed?! there are those that claim that monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain. if this book is any indication one can't help but wonder if monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! there is nothing logical or for that matter even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book. it would have been worthwhile if monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner. instead he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own personal dream experiences: these wander so aimlessly from paragraph to paragraph that one can't help but wonder what real point if any he was trying to make. the really sad thing is that i had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - i was actually quite interested in the topic. having now been subjected to two of his useless books i'm amazed that they're still in print. this is pseudo-science at its absolute worst.

" dark tort was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read but for a novel that's supposed to be part of a quirky light mystery series i found things a bit leaden. the book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered and when we finally do move beyond that scene a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further. i do admit that it also doesn't help that i'm one of those people who can't suspend disbelief and have to ask ...so she's an off-site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified? but that's just me. oh well... many of the recipes did sound good though i doubt i'll get around to making any of them. this is one of those reviews where it's probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series (which i personally haven't read but suspect aren't much different than this one) you'll likely enjoy this installment too. the rest of us can just wait for the latest robert b. parker spenser novel for our light mystery fix.

" apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy of course is moral -- according to rawls and bolsheviks) and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral) and 3) who commits the act (the state/society of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation) and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). to look at this another way if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and justice according to rawls' formula). if the community comes into your house and steals from you it's legal and moral justice again according to rawls. because according to rawls if before you were born you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. how? by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. so those with more would be like oh say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. so those with more would become a resource or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because society (the robin hoods and rawls of the world) deemed this as moral justice. rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk entrepreneurs students of life who work to earn an a vs. students who earn an f. he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. true. but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. forcing the wealthier ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't justice or moral. it would simply be an unjust law. some people see rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism). i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. in a sense this book is an argument against the individual. it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). curious. how do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one) a collective? or as a unique isolated independent individual? there should be societal incentives to help each other. okay. but when it is forced (theft of property always implies force) it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue by definition. transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?

" first off i'd like to tell you that this is only the second star wars book i've ever read 'jedi search' being the first. i actually liked the first book it drew upon the star wars lore well and was a decent read. however this book made me groan in so many places that i felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it (be warned this may contain a few spoilers). thusly: how much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions? it reminds me of a 'little britain' sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the bible out to make up the space! i don't mind the story being 20-odd pages shorter if it comes to the point! for some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to 'ground' the story by constantly relating to the star wars films. for example when wedge and the scientist go to that forest-resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there he says something along the lines of: i was actually in the cantina in mos eisley when luke met han and chewbacca little did i know the brush i had with history there.... gahhhhhhh!!! why!? how did he know!? it didn't need it!! *bangs head on desk* he does this throughout the two books i've read so far!! how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without 'proving' that it's true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films? then there's admiral daala. made an admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking.... so what is she doing in this? she's reviewing recordings of speeches given by tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing! it's only the end of the second book and she's down to 1 star destroyer! she should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens. (i.e. the rebellion win) he then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea that of having a jedi academy (the point of the trilogy!). there's so much that could have been done here - new and original training for the jedi but no - he has the jedi go two-by-two into the forest (holding hands?) to *sense* things... it's meant to be a sci-fi series! something could have been done to make this so much better! i was incensed to find that luke was actually made 'boring' in this book. part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how luke had grown. it all started very promisingly in the first book having learnt that luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever! (cool! i thought). it got to the stage where i'd dread coming back to the jedi parts of the story because he was so dull. the other trainee jedi needed serious character development (they were 1 dimensional!) - entering every scene with luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just wasn't good enough. as other reviewers have said - one of his students goes rogue somehow gains the knowledge of building a super-lightsabre (great idea btw!! we need more of that!) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters... and luke just meditates about it!? *grr* okay all that being said it was 'okay' and on the strength of the first book i will be reading the next book (it's like a car accident - you've just got to look!).

" no doubt about it. this book covers the history of the border patrol. however it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a fluff piece than anything else. as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent (13 years) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity). pacheco as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least) appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target. his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line (i apologize for the pun) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial. did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed? if so then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else. if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security. simply put the border patrol as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating. remember the incompetence of fema (a homeland security subcomponent)? well multiply that incompetence times ten. heard about the poor morale of fema employees? multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol. a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out. those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs. the bottom line is that as a former agent i lose sleep at night knowing what i know. pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda. that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u.s. border patrol agent. the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits. read the book for enjoyment and homage. just don't expect critical analysis. in fact this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge (for you ib agents in san diego).

" when i found out francis collins has written a book about his faith i ordered it the same day. after all we seemed to be following the same path. i earned a phd in molecular biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene cloning. then i found christ as a 40-year-old. my transition was from a semi-serious jew to a materialist to a serious christian. hearing about dr. collins' spiritual walk had me intrigued. his book should be entitled a politician presents evidence for belief. it is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research. the human genome project is elevated to status of bridge to a momentous new era. hogwash. hype is the term i would use. the dept. of energy was duped into footing the bill because the national institutes of health saw it as a waste of resources. the author couldn't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk dna' than previously thought. dr. collins then explained darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma. this oversimplification is typical of those who never studied biology except at a medical school. this is not entirely his fault however since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution isn't perfectly gradual and perfectly random. their motivation should be perfectly obvious but it's not even on dr. collins' radar. he also uses mendel's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics assuming the reader would be ignorant that mendel's data was `dry-labbed'. usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either biology or theology. dr. collins relies on two sources for his treatise on theology: st. augustine and c.s. lewis. i happen to agree with him that the creation story and the books of job and song of solomon have a lyrical and allegorical flavor. i would include the book of jonah in that category as well. however there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked. the only time dr. collins makes a strong case for anything it is to refute edward o wilson richard dawkins and their minions. even then he uses a quote from the late stephen jay gould for his most scathing criticism. francis collins is the consummate politician--he takes a stand without offending anyone. dr. collins knows that jesus was not a politician and he did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time. take this quote from mat 23:14 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. dr. collins' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists. in my opinion it is a piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the human genome project myth.

" even if somehow bin laden did pick up this book and for some reason decide to read it he would not stick with it to learn the lesson that his victims are real average struggling people. the fictional letter/diary to bin laden from the mother of a fictional attack victim from an arsenal-chelsea soccer game which eleven suicide bombers interrupted is so boring bin laden would give it away before learning what the author wants him to. the mother just waffles on and on and on and on and on taking forever to get to the point of what she wants to say in any paragraph. if bin laden is ever captured maybe force him to read this as torture or something. also why does chris cleve chose to glorify bin ladden by crediting him with a new attack when lets face it he hasn't achieved much since september 11 2001 other than be the world hide and seek champion cowering in a cave somewhere. this book would have been more realistic and made more sense as a letter to the ira hezbollah hamas islamic jihad or one of the current more frequently operating groups. alternatively base it on a fictional mother of a fictional character on one of the planes or in the world trade centre. a good concept for a book but poorly written and to be quite frank extremely boring!

" having been a fan of antonia fraser for many years i highly anticipated her biography of queen marie-antoinette but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. she depicts marie-antoinette's mother empress maria theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to france at age 14 to get married but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. what startled me most is that fraser not only insists on antoinette having an affair with count axel von fersen of which there is little concrete evidence but goes onto maintain that axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. it seems to me that marie-antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister caroline went on to have eleven children or more. she was also a devout catholic and using such devices were unthinkable unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. in this case fraser is applying the morals of some british aristocratic ladies to a queen of france. if marie-antoinette had been caught in adultery it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. with all of her enemies at court that was not a risk she would have taken if she had been so inclined. on a smaller scale fraser makes ridiculous assertions about marie-antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that i have seen of her her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; i have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where lady fraser's life ends and where marie-antoinette's life begins. i found it offensive that at the end fraser interprets marie-antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. especially since marie-antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and napoleon crowning himslf emperor. sadly there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the english language. one can only hope that the works of bertieres chalon and delorme will soon be translated and published in english. fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than lever's travesty ",negative

" oh dear. this is another book like the horrible who moved my cheese? that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children. like the aforementioned who thinks my cheese stinks? (or whatever it is called) i saw some people in the organisation where i work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days. it's all about making work fun. yep work can be fun. tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal. or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases. of course it's just great fun to deal with children who have just had their parents killed or folks who just lost their kids. because that's what work is - fun - or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers. of course in the examples i have listed above it doesn't really work too well because this is really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing daily tasks can be fun. myself i do have some fun at work but probably like many people with more than one brain cell it is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us. you can call this cynicism which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb fish-style work must be fun philosophy. i'd call it black humour but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable. as to the title of my review - this method of making the workplace fun in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise. first immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as fun. second let them know that they now choose their attitude - if they are unhappy in any way (regardless of them doing their work well or not) they are letting the team down and not complying with the obligation to make work fun. third while the majority of victims or workers however you choose to view your prey swallow the work is fun message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of fish you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not having fun at work and use the enron-style message that they just don't get it. in this way the resistant individual can be said to be incompatible with our mission and values bad for morale or just out of step. in this way the fun-loving workers who have now taken on the costume of forced false fun can be set against them. of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign. this book is useful then if you wish to convince idiots that their work is fun. just don't try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously. they might tell you to stick your fish where the sun doesn't shine ",negative
" this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework. writing a book is no small feat and technical books are a special beast. with that last statement in mind this is were the book sadly falls short. for one the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books' code. the authors explain ( on the publisher site ) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print. while improvement is always good this presents two problems. 1. the sample application is now out of sync with the material. not a good thing for those trying to learn as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book. also and this is not to disparage the authors skill but i buy books because i am expecting experienced if not expert advice. if a small sample application needs rewriting perhaps they should write about something else? further down this road the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling. i suspect that the final build file was not tested or it was a case of well it compiles on my machine. there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled. thankfully i use eclipse and imported the project. eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive. examples are: jakarta-commons/collections and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access. for an experienced developer familiar with ant and a good ide it was not a lot of trouble to get it running it just did not give me a good impression. bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql: first no matter what db you swap in you'll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file. i made property variables which i placed in build.properties. then you will need to change the class user to something else ( and of course anything in the app that references it. ). another great reason to use eclipse. why you must change it is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you can't name a table user ",negative
" this series may be good for a laugh. some of the writing is engaging. but the premise is absurd. why in this day and age should anyone accept the world-view of the bible? a book that tells us to buy and sell slaves stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of mt. sinai? in a sense bible believers have been left behind since the 1700s enlightenment. tom paine's the age of reason showed the god of the bible to be a cruel vindictive monster. and what did thomas jefferson call the book of revelations? the ravings of a madman. read this series if you like. enjoy parts of it. but make no mistake: to take any of this seriously you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view before men learned to think to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god. do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? when the sheep are raptured up to heaven their clothes are left behind. so heaven is a nudist colony? the basic contradiction of course lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly the supernatural. but why should we care whether any of the good guys gets killed? and why should they mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? that's what they want isn't it? why even lift a finger against the bad guys -- didn't christ say resist not evil? worried about who will win? god is infinitely powerful. so jesus (who is 1/3 of god -- or something like that) is sure to win when armageddon rolls around in book 12 of the series. and the sheep -- the believers -- will happily worship him looking just like the pictures of dim-witted bovine people you see in the tracts jehovah's witnesses leave at your door. the going price for a used copy of tribulation force is one cent. does that tell you something? actually the story-telling is worth more. the basic premise is worth less. perhaps it averages out ",negative
" it took two people to write this book? i was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40-something reader but this book really was a waste of my time. you can see the ending a mile away for one but that didn't really bother me. it was the writing. the main character suffers from a syndrome that's unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines which is to speak in an overly quippy aren't-i-clever with my snappy dialog way. nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke). real people just don't talk that way and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her. by the way my copy had the first chapter of these authors' next book attached at the end and they've basically created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend. i won't bother with it ",negative
" eugene o'neill's play long day's journey into night is a pulitzer award winning autobiographical play about his family. i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater i did not enjoy reading this play. the tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion. the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. no happy ending no hope for the future just despair. long day's journey into night is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without. however after learning more about eugene o'neill's background and the extent to which the play is based on his life i began to have a greater appreciation for this play. o'neill did lead a very hard life therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. while o'neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending it was appropriate for the play as eugene's own family never got a happy ending. i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal loving family. the audience soon however gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right and that the family is tense. slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. although i still believe long day's journey into night to be thoroughly disheartening to read the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill's exceptional writing.

" despite the fact that hanegraaff's name is the bigger of the two on the front cover only the first 40 pages of this very small book are worth reading and they are the writing of paul maier. his research is helpful but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn't given a week-end to write it and come up with as much as he could. every topic needs futher information. a lot more could be said and maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more. hanegraaff contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical jesus which is an even more surface-level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere. that said i would give this book to someone who isn't much of a reader but for whom the da vinci code has raised some questions. it isn't much more than a collection of scattered soundbites but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction ",negative
" this book reads like a horror novel. by allowing her dogs (as well as another one in her care) to roam freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads the author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals' welfare. not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her total inconsideration for her neighbors and for the countless strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on their doorsteps. oh and let's not forget the dozens of shelter dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by the plethora of puppies spawned by the author's choice not to spay and neuter her animals. this book moves at a peppy pace and might have been interesting (albeit morally reprehensible) if the author's observations actually provided any insight. but those eighteen-wheelers on the alewife parkway veered closer to poor misha than the author's whimsical interpretations stray within range of scientific evidence. case in point: she is so clueless about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently allows one of her dogs to kill another one's litter of puppies. oops! any genuine dog lover (or any human with an ounce of compassion and common sense) will despise this book. a previous reviewer hit the nail on the head: if feelings are your road map to life you might enjoy this book. if you regularly take your brain out for walk forget it. calling this a meaningful book about dogs is like calling jonathan livingston seagull the definitive text on marine fowl ",negative

dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak reality in the back door) and perhaps this is due to ryle whose famous book 'the concept of mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted. that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine. dennett enjoys making the mistakes wittgenstein ryle(andmany others since) have exposed in detail. byaccidentjust before this book i had read ''the minds i'' which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981. they made some bad mistakes(see my review) and saddest of all they reprinted twofamous articles that pointed the

this topic)havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem--ie how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things but it isclear that we are nowhere near it now. dennett has mostly ignored his critics but has favored searle with vituperative personal attacks.searle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious thinks etc. he just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens. searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology''the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. dennett repeats his mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of the book where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how! unsurprisingly there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book.there arehowever many

will(whichi hopewe can equate with choice) is compatible with determinism(ie that''there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future''--p25). he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. however the whole book is smoke and mirrors by means of which choice in the sense we normally understand it disappears and we are left with ``choice`` which is something we cannot choose. naturally this echoes the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``consciousness explained``. it is remarkable that at a time when we are just beginning to reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a single neuron works(or how an atom works for that matter) that anyone should think they can make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain its most complex phenomena. please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote: ''and what'smorethis satisfies a longing for thetranscendent because insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of human understanding'theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these.`` the relation between language thought and reality is extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. if one is very very carefulsome understanding is possible but dennett throws caution to the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. there are at least 3 different topics here(evolution of our brain choice and morality) and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into a coherent account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic crashing of atoms. there is however no compelling reason to accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example the game of life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality. he knows that quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle) is a major obstacle to determinism however defined(and has been taken by many as an escape to freedom) but dismisses it due to the fact that such events are too rare to bother with. by extension its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our whole lifetime in our brain so we appear to be stuck with a determined brain(whatever that may be). however the universe is a big place and its been around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum effect occurs it would seem to throw the whole universe into an indeterminate state. the notion ''there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future'' cannot be true if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this case there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. this recalls one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each instant our universe is branching into infinitely many universes. he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice. this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon). if so they will definitely win at least one nobel prize for not only will they have explained consciousness they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). so they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain. it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable even for one atom or a vacuum as it would require an infinite amount of computer time. but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer. he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws of physics for protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls but physics is made of notions just as fantastic(uncertainty entanglement wave/particle duality schrodinger's dead/alivecat etc) and as feynmann said many times ``nobody understandsphysics!'' many think nobody ever will. on pg 2 he says our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and on pg 2 to3 that our personality differences are due to how our ''robotic teams are put togther over a lifetime of growth and experience.`` this is a bald dismissal of human nature of the abundant evidence that our differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early childhood and is typical of his constant confused wandering back and forth between determinism and environmentalism. on page 9 he notes that free will is a problem and our attitudes to it make a difference but for whom? nobody but philosophers. we make choices. what's the problem? one has to step outside life to experience a problem and then everything becomes a problem. what are consciousness pain yellow intention matter quarks gravity etc.? i doubt that anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their interactions with people or their decision making processes due to their thinking about choice. this shows that there is something strange about such questions. wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are different. there are games for language connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing colors etc and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. decoupled modes permit thinking about the past planning for the future guessing the mental states of others etc but if one takes the results in the wrong way and starts to think `'john will try to steal my wallet'' rather than just imagining that john might do it confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode enter the realm of pathology. some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in eg notbeing able to see the difference between the motives people have and the motives they might have. one can then see much of the philosophizing people do as operating in these decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them the differences from the normal mode. normal mode--eg what is that lion doing-- was undoubtedly the first one evolved and decoupled modes--what did that lion do last time or what does he intend to do next--evolved later. this was probably never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much time worrying about what might happen would not be very successful contributing to the gene pool. it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began degeneratinggenetically could large numbers of people survive with genes that led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes. hence we have philosophy and this book which is mostly about running the decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results in a book for other people to use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' let us alter wittgenstein's quote to read: ''as longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide' that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and 'to drink'as long as we continueto talk of freedom of action of saying i wish i had done otherwise etc. etc. people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up.'' as withmost philosophy books nearly every page often every paragraph changes from one type of language game to another without noticing that now one would have to be joking or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story etc and not actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the world. on page 10 he says we count on free will for the whole way of thinking about our lives like we count on food and water but who ever outside philosophy standing in front of lunch counter full of food ever thinks how fine it is that they have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water? even if i want to be a serious compatibilist and try thinking this in decoupled mode i have to exit and enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. only then can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had the ability to make a real choice. wittgenstein noted how pretend games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!). the ability to engage in very complex decoupled scenarios is already evident in 4 year old children. so i would say that normally nobody counts on having choice but rather we just choose. on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive basics. he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice and that `'it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct as eternal and unchanging as arithmetic but it is not.'' and on page 13--''it is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs''. the whole thrust of cognitive psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning deciding promising resenting etc but that these are built-in functions of the inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in very early childhood. there is no evidence that they change as we grow or are in any way subject to our beliefsonly that they mature just as our body does. on pg 14 he suggests its probable that our having free will depends on our believing we have it! do we believe we see an apple feel a pain are happy? the language game of belief is very different from that of knowing. we can believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't meaningfully then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). the inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can imagine havingchoices or making them but in life we just make them and it is only in very odd situations we can say that we believe we made a choice. but dennett is saying thisis the universal case. if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness seeing thinkingetc. if we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of free will' ) then we are getting into trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life then madness is minutes away. . on page 65 et seq. he discusses causation intention and the `informal predicates' that we use to describe atoms etc but cognitive resarch has shown that we describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or things like them--ie ghosts or gods) are involved we use our concepts (engines) for agency intuitive psychology social minds etc to decide how to behave. there is almost certainly no causation module but rather it will involve all of these and other inference engines depending on the precise situation. discussing possibility and necessity is much easier if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive physics agency ontological categories etc. of course there is no mention here of wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation intention deciding nor of searle's now classic works on intention and social reality. he spends much time on ainslie's book 'breakdown of will' in which is discussed the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie inference engines) by which we evaluate probable outcomes. hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism emotion and economics but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. it was bingham's idea amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson (1992) that cooperation was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that areobligatory and promising. indeed they are and in fact they are standard parts of economic evolutionary and cognitive theory but unfortunately he makes little reference to the other work in these fields. all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. onpg 216 he says that making oneself so that one could not have done otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free will and that we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive to opportunities. but where this ability resides is not revealed for several chapters! dennett has a penchant for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of rather irrelevant text. again he gets things backwards as there is a vast body of very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and these are not provided by some part of our conscious self but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the engines. as he notes hundreds of experiments with the prisoner's dilemma and related protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at all. when the situation is manipulated to make them consciousthey are much slower and less reliable. so there has been constant pressure of natural selection to make the engines fast and automatic and inacessible to deliberate thought. dennett says `we make ourselves' so that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis of morality and choice. the evidence would seem to be exactly the opposite. our inference engines give us basic moral intuitions and we generally act in accord with the results. if we or others do not we feel guilt outrage resentment etc then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it. we can often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval usually serve to limit our choices. these intuitions evolved in small groups between 50000 and some millions of years ago. in the modern world the intuitions are often not to our advantage and the social controls weak. this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world. on pg 225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making(from certain angles)''. he claims that thisplays all the valuable roles of free will but lacks some (unspecified) properties possessed by traditional free will. the smoke is thick but i am pretty sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. he insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic account of decision making leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility but making ourselves so we couldn't do otherwise does not seem to describe the way we actually function nor does it seem to leave any room for morality as that would seem to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise. he does not propose any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary or forced and i doubt he could do so. normally if someone asks us to move our hand we know what counts as having a choice but typical of philosophers i expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position. at this point he also starts his discussion of libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time. on page 253 et seq. he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the ''brains user illusion of itself''' which has as one of its main roles providing ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``. and ``illusory or not conscious will is the persons guide to his or her own moral responsibility for action.`` he says the trick we need is to see that ``i`' control what is happening inside the ''simplification barrier''... ''where decision making happens''. ``mental events'' become conscious by ''entering into memory''. ''the process of self description... is what we are''. the crucial thing is that choice is possible because the self is distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories). he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''i know that many people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. it seems to them to be a trickwith mirrors some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness and the real self out of the picture just when it was about to be introduced.'' many will say he took the words out of their mouth but i would say it's incoherent and thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims) was gone long beforewegot this far. on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals! this is a stunning denial of human nature(ie genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'darwin's dangerous idea''! presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom). he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either). though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind intuitive psychology coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture thats ok but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes. we are also told here that r&d(by which he means evolution here but other things elsewhere) has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality. i am sure that he will get little agreement on this. it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain). he continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake! and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say even if he was only referring to memes. on pg 260 he claims that because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions to cooperate'' they mean nothing to us but it is the operation of our templates that is everything to us. there is ample evidence that if one of them is damaged a person cannot function properly as a social being(eg autism). i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think. he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology. i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions like all the templates are accessible to consciousness. we may decide our cheating was justifiable or forgive someone else's cheating but we still know it was cheating(ie we cannot change the engine). i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings. another issue is that as culture developed one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer. on pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. and on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. again he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self which takes responsibility. it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition. on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing. it's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people. he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'the blank slate'). he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion. this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms. on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess(evolutionarily stable strategy) can produce morality. his idea here is that genetic `r&d` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications. i would say that we all know and much research has made clear that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases. culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings. the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability. he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore which i started reading 30 years ago since it's authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein. dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us. but there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book. there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities. there is no sign here nor in anything he has done that dennett is morally superior. after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them. it seems clear that like all of us he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines. so how much opportunity is there to improve our morality? it seems clear(eg see pinker's `the blank slate`) that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. on average maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can study) is due to our own efforts. the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world. but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect. how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is. and if one did we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc. but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is! and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first. to return to the quote at the beginning--'ambition is the death of thought'. indeed--though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts ",negative

" this book really wasn't at all what i was expecting or what the title would lead one to believe. the subtitle in search of grace o'malley and other legendary women of the sea makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of grace o'malley with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers. not so. the first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself and sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information. i knew almost nothing about grace o'malley going into the book and i know little more than that now. the other women included are discussed in even sparer detail and most of them aren't even real historical figures but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. she even talks about pippi longstocking! not what i was expecting at all... the pirate queen is actually devoted far more to sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself. i learned more about sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study. she describes the inns she stayed at the weather the tourists she met her own childhood the abundance of personal bath mats in northern european hotels... almost everything but grace o'malley and her cohorts. in fact the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from wilson to sjoholm; a story which to be quite honest i really couldn't care less about. i bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures. it turned out to be a travel memoir and a comparatively uninteresting one at that. this is a shame really. sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - grace o'malley herself bessie millie janet forsyth christian robertson eliza fraser isobel gunn betty mouat freydis eiriksdottir skipper thuridur trouser-beret alfhild the herring lassies and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite but then fails to deliver a full satisfying portrait of any of them. she raises more questions than she answers and i'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information. you may also notice given the names that nearly all the women mentioned are northern european in origin. sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world such as the famous pirates anne bonney and mary read who though from europe sailed the caribbean. as for sjoholm's writing style the book is an easy read but not a very enjoyable one. sjoholm's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. for example: the lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates walnuts and chocolate chips. in the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola (pg. 222). flowery gratuitous and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin you might say... it's not the worst book i've ever read but i do wish i'd spent my money on something else. it doesn't deliver what it promises and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead ",negative

" i had heard of the importance and significance of the education of henry adams for a long time. i finally determined i needed to read it. i acutally read it twice and found less in it the second time than the first. i am sorry i missed the greatness of this book. i am sure there was something wrong with me but i found it to be incredibly unimpressive. perhaps this came from the fact that henry adams was not a likeable man. he was famous for holding court in his home near the white house and making caustic and negative comments about every president who lived there. granted he lived in washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the white house. but the thought of people wasting their time trying to please a blue-blooded snob like adams depresses me. why did anyone bother? he lived in an atmosphere of snobbery sharp-tongues clever remarks and brilliant conversation. the world went on without him truth be told and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day. he was a very good historian in his time. but who reads his books now? not very many. in short his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. maybe the influence of some of the presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of henry adams. the education of henry adams does not have much real information. he got education in one place none in others. surely the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book. when eric sevareid wrote not so wild a dream it was compared to the education of henry adams. that was meant as a compliment. oddly i think sevareid's book is much much better. sevareid wrote of america the common man the war and what it all meant to him. adams needed to get out more. he did not see america--not the america built by the common citizen who put it all together and defended it. i gained a trememdous amount from sevareid. i cannot say the same for the work of henry adams. again a lot of this might be me. perhaps i read the book at a bad time. maybe i needed to read it a third time. i do not know. i do know i do not think this is a great american classic. forgive please my ignorance.

" david fromkin's peace to end all peace is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other. fromkin attempts to examine how the modern middle east (extending as far as afghanistan and some sections of central asia) was created during and after the first world war. obviously in order to do this the fall of the ottoman empire in that war must be considered. this is where fromkin's unusual methodology comes into play. focusing on the european political machinations to resolve the eastern question in their favour the sorry tale becomes one more of churchill and te lawrence than of the arabs and turks who were also involved in the process. admittedly it was the europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn but reducing key figures such as the cup triumvirate in the dying ottoman empire (and kemal ataturk in turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much. never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell. a complex web of national and personal political interests in both europe and the middle east combined to make the region what it is today and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations. the problem that fromkin has however is that he does not make these very well at all. the story is told in a roughly chronological manner which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters. ultimately the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is. additionally fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided. indeed one map (showing enver pasha's advance on baku and his campaigns in central asia) is laughable in the extreme. the legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows and not equilateral triagles. where fromkin does well however is in his use of purely european sources. it is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern middle east but i have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the middle eastern aspects of the events in question. in terms of europe however his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did. ultimately a peace to end all peace is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work. a diplomatic history of europe during the great war can be written much better than this and a history of the development of the middle east following that conflict already has been (the chapters in margaret attwood's the peacemakers or william cleveland's modern middle east both easily outshine this) ",negative

" after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory this sequel was an absolute let-down. the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie's (formerly wonka's) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth. while beyond the reaches of earth's atmosphere our heroes---charlie grandpa joe and mr. wonka---must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids (pronounced k'nids) aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes. far worse than these beasties though are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless. charlie joe and wonka with no help from charlie's folks or other grandparents save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills returning them to infancy or beyond. charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters. at the end of the novel the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president. in short these three are the most tedious spiteful unredeemable characters i've come across in children's literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa-loompas as i read this book. as it is they (unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last. their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore rather than a joy to read.

" the book is well-written. most parts of it i can agree with. but there is a crucial mistake in parson's message --- oneness likes to play separation. i can say clearly that oneness does not play separation. duality/ego is simply a mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution. saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion. also his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the mercy of something and this is clearly very dualistic. without ego both doing and not doing are actions of oneness to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake. there are many illuminating sentenses in this book but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap. in my life it was understanding especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness. the one who is doing the understanding is still oneness. there is no duality in doing and not doing. at right this moment you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop. of courses you make choices in daily life. if you really understand what is meant by nond-duality you will not make such statements such as there is no choice.

" i respect the message of the unexpected legacy of divorce but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce unexpected. those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result. staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times. the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit. i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time. they fell apart due to abuse infidelity and just plain incompatibility. what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents. when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house. when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority who constantly disappoints hurts and replaces the kids there will be damage no getting away from it. however is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids seemingly with the other parent's approval? i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion. it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married. this is a major flaw in the research. i didn't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference. i don't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears. when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid's whether it's divorce or starting a new life afterward kids will suffer. i don't like 'studies' like this they're misleading and potentially damaging.

" i am leading a christian study group using popular films. i was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some scriptural truth. unfortunately the author was much less interested in a christian message than to make sure he took every opportunity to insult the church. i know that churches have problems and hurt people but it is not as common as this author seems to assert. he seems very angry at the church (and for some reason all of western culture - especially america.) living in n. ireland could make one suspicious of religion i assume but despite his claims to be a chrisitan so concerned about commmunity he seems to enjoy tearing down more than teaching and building up. it is a good study of film (not movies - he definatley comes from a critical point of view and not that of an average person) but not very useful in the context of the church. that's my take anyway. god bless ",negative
" the island of lost maps is the story of a petty crook named gilbert bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the '90s. posing as a researcher bland would enter rare-book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single-edged razor. then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting -- or at least unquestioning -- dealers. before being busted at the peabody library at johns hopkins university in baltimore he had stolen more than a half million dollars' worth of maps. island is the first book for author miles harvey. in the book he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350-page book. he is only partly successful. i found the material on bland's crime fascinating. however bland as a subject does not fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull. unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text. i found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime. there is some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of discovery and modern mapmaking. but as a true crime book it over extends itself. it would be a more interesting book to read if it were shorter and more focused ",negative

" to cover all the problems with continuity logic theology geography and plain common sense in _left behind_ would take a whole book. one hardly knows where to start. perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel. as such it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes we get sanctimonious sermonizing. worse than that what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late. the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized. even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support) little in the characters' actions thought processes or dialog rings true. one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student. god ends up looking like the ultimate villain demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else. whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear? who is the present-day equivalent of c. s. lewis or catherine marshall and why aren't they getting more attention? these were writers who actually made you think. lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought. they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask. one wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter. these days it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted bigoted caricature of what it once was. perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured. if _left behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind ",negative

" i read this book with an open mind. i am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status. in a few cases i think this criticism may be legitimate; in other cases not. so i was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the holocaust or their advocates in the jewish community. (note: i am not equating child abuse and the holocaust. i am saying that when people speak up about terrible things there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities. all things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction.) i didn't find anything in this book to convince me of that. what i found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the jewish reaction to the holocaust in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons but this discussion is so subjective and brief that i was not persuaded to adopt his point of view. the bulk of the book consists of complaints that jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as switzerland. the argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because i have never read the reports (audits etc.) to which the author refers. but i think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point. i expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the holocaust caused some jews to play the victim card and what i got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which i have no way of determining the truth of the author's allegations. to me it seems obvious that the holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the jews and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result. it seems reasonable to me that the jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage and to the extent that this book detracts from this i think it is unfortunate ",negative

" i picked up this volume because its title suggested that it would encourage hands-on science activities that are essential to good teaching and effective learning. unfortunately i discovered on reading it that the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific &quot;establishment&quot; with credulity for numerous fringe ideas. the first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers to tell when you'll be home for dinner! sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as &quot;evidence&quot;. the &quot;do it yourself&quot; promise of the title is broken for the reader who doesn't intend to begin raising homing pidgeons or doesn't happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants (such as the speed of light) to nine significant figures. far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic research are given (in chapters about the feeling of being stared at or &quot;feeling&quot; the touch of a severed limb). despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book i liked a part of its message that important science can still be done by amateurs. that's about the only aspect of this book that is commendable ",negative

" i love judith mcnaught's work. her historicals are stellar one-of-kind novels that pull at your heart strings. in my opinion all of her historicals are winners. some of her contemporary works are fabulous as well - perfect and paradise to name a few. there are other contemporary flops though (remember when triumphant heart etc). every breath you take was such a disappointment. the plot character development and writing was not up to par. i found it very hard to believe that a couple could fall in love in 2 days be separated for two years and then fall back in love instantly upon meeting again. it was really forced. someone mentioned it was amatuerish and i have to agree. i think anyone could have written this novel. i understand that the book was rushed and to tell you the truth it reads like a novel that was written in a mad dash. i love judith but this book was just terrible ",negative

" on our beloved kay scarpetta and the illustrious ms. cornwell? having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning i simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? very slow in the beginning i began to fear a repeat of the struggle that i endured to finish blowfly. however this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted. the storyline finds scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...richmond virginia where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl. so scarpetta---with marino tagging along of course---heads back to richmond from her new home in florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one under the leadership of dr. joel marcus is sloppy regarding policies and procedures. the demoralization of her former staff by dr. marcus is also unnerving to scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. so why has he asked her to come? meanwhile lucy as head of the last precinct is once again up to her ears in nonsense. for such a brilliant successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe) why must cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life? in this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. worse than the weak storyline and the fact that this novel is just all over the place is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of african-americans throughout. drug dealers are black they're dead of gunshot wounds and most ludicrous of all is in one instance cornwell references a dead young man's conspicuously large organ. are you kidding me? the trash collectors are big dark men and of course in an upscale neighborhood the old black woman must work in one of the houses. the author's unbelievably narrow-minded stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as lucy. read only if you must but frankly there are better ways to spend your time. dy ",negative

" gerd ludemann writes historical research shows with definite clarity that jesus was not raised from the dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax (190). a summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support. three streams of thought permeate the resurrection of christ: gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish invent or explain away; peter and paul experienced hallucination and vision experiences proceeding from self-deception; belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific. each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter-christian polemic. in his chapter translation and analysis of the early christian texts on the resurrection ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles purpose and tradition reworked (re. gospel writers) and historical elements. in the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic or perhaps (he intimates) to cover up some element of embarrassment. for example ludemann asserts that we may conclude that joseph of arimathea was a member of the jewish council (which condemned jesus) but that mark (earliest gospel) likely invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of god and had become a disciple of jesus. but ludemann needs to discredit such notions for all four gospel writers record joseph as the rich council member that buried jesus in his own tomb. ludemann's case will be much weaker if jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances. ludemann gets carried away with himself when he in tabloid fashion suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial of jesus. this is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze. ludemann goes so far as to accuse matthew mark and luke of being anti-jewish! (refer to the ridiculous appendix 3). is christianity a history of self deception? ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of hallucination; for the burden is on ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of jesus available in the new testament. that any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid. ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence. 1 corinthians 15 is the new testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of jesus' multiple appearances. even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text (vs. 3-5) to the early 30's ad. the discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection three physical events. also the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of jesus eating and offering his body for examination as well as being hugged! ludemann though convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions introduces hallucination. what accounts for these hallucinations? peter's vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning (165). paul's event had a character of light and like the vision of john happened in the spirit i.e. in ecstasy (47). but paul does not report i was in the spirit as john does (see revelation 1). john is deliberately conveying a non-physical experience. paul is not. when paul does have opportunity to convey an actual in the spirit experience he does so in terms appropriate to that experience (2 corinthians 12:2). so we have record of paul's ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual. ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages modern depth psychology to explain paul's conversion from zealous persecutor of christians to apostle-in-chief of a new program of salvation (170-171). so we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of paul's subconscious state than from the widely accepted facts of jesus death burial empty tomb and appearances! ludemann's examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural. historians look for the best explanation of the evidence. yet ludemann writes who decides at what point of historical study a `theological explanation' ought to begin (201). this is rife with misunderstanding. one need only confirm that an event occurred in history regardless of theological implications. also simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism (thus supernaturalism) is an entirely logical proposition. yet ludemann quotes another author [the disciples] believed in phantoms; ... imagined that they were surrounded by miracles; ... took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time. (175). this ignores the new testament textual evidence that initially jesus' disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works. even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle! ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with paul that if there is no resurrection we should abandon christianity. sadly he reaches the wrong conclusion. self deluded by a proliferation of one can imagine seems to indicate likely enough and one thus suspects reasoning ludemann boasts accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer easter vision.

" murky: in his book 1984 orwell described a contrived language he called newspeak designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible. but before orwell there were russell and whitehead who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence. as whitehead wrote in his foreword to quine's ph.d. dissertation titled a system of logic: logic shapes metaphysical thought. thus in his on universals quine argued that in the russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as entities. and he co-authored with goodman steps toward a constructive nominalism a nominalist manifesto in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or platonists depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities. i believe that anyone who says that universals are referenced or who uses the phrase abstract entities fully deserves to be labeled a platonist. but loux uses the rhetoric from the russellian nominalist newspeak. in the search inside this book screens at this amazon web site the reader will find him reporting (p. 20) that realists say universals are shared entities and are referents of predicates. i ask loux: what happened to signification? the symbolic logician alonzo church recognized sense (i.e. signification) as well as denotation (i.e. reference) in the functional (i.e. predicate) calculus. i ask loux: what happened to supposition which distinguishes reference from signification? in his book titled meaning and necessity rudolf carnap explicitly affirms that intensions (i.e. significations) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization (i.e. reference) and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects. i ask loux: since the demise of logical positivism does the russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else? is loux trying to appear contemporary with the russellian rhetoric? i see murky writing. muddled: loux is sympathetic to aristotle and unsympathetic to quine the pragmatic realist who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing. ontological relativity started as an analogy: quine relativized ontology as einstein relativized time. einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of newton's absolute time and he rejected lorentz's making relativistic time apparent time. likewise heisenberg invoked this einstein precedent for his own realistic copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory's positing of duality and indeterminacy. today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition nonlocality and calabi-yau spaces in eleven dimensions. quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs. realism is a natural primordial irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories. on the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial. it is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history. it is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories. but in notre dame journal of formal logic and in this book loux rejects ontological relativity and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity anti-realism. in fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change. i do not find this book contemporary. loux's realism - anti-realism locution is a false dichotomy. i see muddled thinking. marginalized: while a student i found notre dame's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism. when i left their graduate school of philosophy i took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking. i see in this book a textbook in notre dame metaphysics for notre dame philosophy students. readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this amazon site. thomas j. hicke ",negative
" i wanted to like this book... i enjoyed the first two in the series. but this one left me a bit dry... babylon rising: the europa conspiracy by tim lahaye and bob phillips. this continues the story of michael murphy a college professor teaching biblical archaeology. he is now heading off to iraq to follow a tip on the location of the handwriting on the wall from the days of daniel. he's falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life. talon and the mysterious seven are trying to eliminate him and there are a few attempts on his life. mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on new york designed to throw america into an economic and national panic as well as to prompt the un to move their headquarters to the ancient city of babylon. murphy for someone who's pretty much a small fish in the large ocean finds himself in the middle of all this... as i said i really wanted to like this book. the murphy character is likeable and i enjoyed the action. but the plotline was spotty and over the top. murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him (highly unlikely). everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time (over the top). the story attempted to be both a christian end times novel and a terrorist suspense novel and they didn't do either one especially well. murphy's growing infatuation with isis was rather repetitive with the she's so beautiful and could she be interested in me interludes. and finally none of the plotlines wrapped up. you got to the end and thought so? fine if you're ready to read the next installment but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one... part of me wants to be nice give the book the benefit of the doubt and rate it a 3. but the authors are better than this and i've come to expect more from someone who's been doing this for a long time... if you're committed to the series you'll want/have/need to read it but just don't come in with your expectations very high..

" seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that james frey fiasco anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as billy crystal. but then they can only put out the cotton-candy coney island fluff as '700 sundays' is. granted the book is based on crystal's highly-praised tony award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al. but it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night kaddish. yet in ripping a page out of billy's book it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went. it probably went something like: hey bubby how about writing a book talking about your 700 sundays with your pop? well i'm not a writer per se. i just jot down a few notes here and there and then go out and perform the material on stage. so here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have. it'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads. don't worry bubby i know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers. here's their recipe: they'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages. 'how?' may you ask! well they'll cut `em in half then cut `em in half again. and using big ink letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses; surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album -- slap it all together between two hardcovers...it'll be just fine. yes but... don't worry. consider it like a vintage bottle of mogen david 20/20 wine aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout. in this case the local bookstores. oh and make sure you give `em just enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and thirsty for more. people'll drink it up. yes but... don't worry face. everybody loves ya. just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about satchmo and mantle you'll be all right. don't forget now we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too. y'know `700 mondays;' then `700 tuesdays' and so on. yes'sir i can see it all now: we've got the lock on all those 700 days of the week shtick. oh and we'll do some holiday editions too starting with `700 hanukkahs!' you're still friends with that kid adam sandler back from your snl days aren't ya?! yes so we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that hanukkah song of his. it'll be a great collaboration. it's good to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once you've made it. y'know god blesses and doesn't forget those things by them who do. yes ok so we'll go ahead from there and do `700 passovers!' and it'll be an annual event too dont'cha know. just think when people see chuck heston...may god keep a special place in heaven for him...when people see chuck heston and the ten commandments they'll be thinking about you too billy. yes'sir we'll have em crying and laughing every year on passover you'll see. oh and holy of holies out of the deal we'll get `700 yom kippurs!' you'll see. but this will be only for our people billy you understand. so you might have to dig deep to get material for it. but that's what authors do they dig deep. but you already knew that right? can you dig it man? i knew that you could. yes but... don't worry face everybody loves ya! your books don't have to be earth-shattering or thought-provoking or anything like that. but hey listen with a book deal a books-on-tape deal and who knows even a movie deal we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets. mark my words we will. and say since you haven't had a hit movie in awhile...no offense...we're going to get martin scorsese to produce and direct your life story. yes it'll be something like 'pinch me i'm still jewish: the billy crystal story' in widescreen and all that jazz. it's what everybody in hollywood's doing right now. yeah no use waiting until your dying or dead already billy - god forbid. no siree bubby!! so scorsese will do the movie on the cheap because god knows the man deserves an oscar already. you know it i know it we all know it billy. and not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either but the really big one see! and just imagine wouldn't it be something if you were hosting the awards ceremony and handed marty his own oscar?! yes well we can schmooze on about all this stuff later. but for now with the books and everything you'll be a one-man franchise yes you will! you'll be on the new york times best seller list from now until forever! it'll be great!! yes but... oh and well i didn't want to say anything just yet but okay here goes: there might be plans to expand everything too! listen bubby i know somebody who knows somebody who...you get the idea...over at the networks. we can do a little chris rock in the neighborhood sort of thing. we'll put a kid who looks and acts like you - about as tall as you - into the neighborhood that you and your family lived in see. and it's going to be a period piece too! we'll introduce all the new kids to the stars of yesteryear -- y'know cantor jolson jessel durante! throw in some goniffs and shiksas that the cast can work off of every week -- it'll be fun! chris rock is great. but you can be greater too. listen face we'll make it a celebration. something like 'growing up mazel tov!' maybe we get 700 shows out of it. maybe less maybe more but people will still love it anyway. you'll see! yes but well i'm not really a writer/author. i'm an entertainer so why would i want to do any of this? we could make a couple of dollars! okay. i'm in! and so it went and so it goes. final analysis: a so not looking mahvelous better luck next time with all due respect sadly not recommended book.

" i have no personal experience with 12-step programs nor do i have dominant addictions (other than book and dvd buying!) but i am a psychologist who has seen a lot of people and their stories and regularly deals with smoking over-eating and love addictions in particular. i was hoping for some new ideas to assist clients. this book takes a rational-emotive type approach to conquering addiction and on that level is fine for those wanting to look at that approach. i also found some of his reference to research of how people recover also quite useful but he seems to have quite a personal and often over-generalised attacking crusade against 12-step programs. some of his concerns about possible problems and misunderstandings many people can have with 12-step programs were valid and useful. similarly i welcomed his questioning of the disease model that has people always defining themselves as an addict and powerless. however he has to keep coming back in every chapter to go over and over the evils he sees in 12-step programs - and in very derogatory judgmental language. he often even implies they are all deliberately manipulating and exploiting people. i got very uncomfortable with his imputing these motives to everyone. there appear to be many genuine people of good intention in these movements (and many who clearly seems to get a lot out of them and have recovered). i would have rather he had used his own rational methods rather than resort to such abusive language. he could have suggested modified views and tools and alternatives to consider. i can't imagine that he would lure anyone away from the 12-step programs he criticises by attacking everything they have been standing for. however a gentler exploration of limitations and evidence and suggestions for alternatives may have opened up a welcomed middle ground ",negative
" flynn offers up a fast-paced if unbelievable story. unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn's political preferences. characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the real world works. meanwhile flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election. while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype. i was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller. i'm still looking.

" mark twain once said that (and i paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. that is my experience with this book. for some reason a tale of two cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists and i figured it was one of those books i should have under my belt. so i picked it up. what a slog! a book that might have been fascinating due to its french revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. we were supposed to shed tears for sidney carton a character who you barely get to know and root for lucie manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. the only thing i liked about this book was how madame defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. an admittedly cool concept. maybe this book speaks to another era maybe it's past its prime maybe i don't have the required literary sensibilities or maybe i couldn't relate but a tale of two cities bored me to tears.

" a good friend of mine insisted i'd read this book because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life. in the end i was very disappointed. not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book but michael crichton's whole attitude. he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences only to revert back to his arrogant narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter. how can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in? sadly this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. i have no desire to read any more of his books ",negative
" i had to read this book for a political theory class in college. after talking with several other members i was happy to find out that i do not have the reading skills of a third grader...benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with. the book is also not organized well. in order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes. points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book. benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued. throughout much of the book benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of john rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights. to be honest i disagree with her views and admit that i might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if i agreed with her. still i do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically. much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories. in short i do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure or intellectual curiosity. if you have to read the rights of others for a class i extend my condolences.

" children love to follow instructions step by step and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep drag on for hours. any adult who cooks like this doesn't cook often cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen. for example who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter melts it in a pan then pours it into a (plastic microwave safe) mixing bowl? great now there's a pan a knife and a cutting board to wash! it is a children's cookbook so why not cut down on time spent with knives stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave? nice pictures large font recipes are great but (in my opinion) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen not a home.

" i have written software for development projects for 30 years and i have managed several projects. martin fowler has extraordinary insight and i enjoy reading his papers for the gems of thought i find. the main lesson i pick up from this book is: break your large project into projects sufficiently small that you can sensibly abandon refactoring for each of the small projects. refactoring works well in some cases i suppose. refactoring works well for some people i suppose. i'm skeptical though. fowler filled the book with page after page of the detailed refactoring method applied to a problem he acknowledged as too simple for application of refactoring. he assures us that refactoring may overload small projects with methodology making it unsuitable for them and it works really well for larger projects. i suspect however that the burden it imposes enlarges as the job enlarges. fowler gives me no good reason to think otherwise. if i'm to risk this methodology on a large project i want to see it perform well on a smaller project first. fowler conceives methodologies that attract zealous disciples. in the case of refactoring the methodology may succeed for its attractiveness rather than for its practical utility ",negative

" i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years. i was born & raised in the north. i think evans should rename his book fiddler on the roof in the south. his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here. it's very much: the southern jews were all so happy they all fit in and were accepted etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'yankee jews' like the instances when a few (yankee)rabbis in the south fought for civil rights. evans should realize that times have really changed here! the evangelical christians in my town (which is most people here) harrass me like crazy - 'i am praying for you!' 'have you read the words of jesus who was a jew like you?' 'when will you come to my church'. blah blah blah. thank god for the minority of catholics methodists presbyterians and a few others who live here. they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am and the way i will stay - a jew. i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience. jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences and that they cannot relate to what i am saying. but i do want to ask evans a few questions: 1) if things are so great for the jews in the south: why have you lived in new york for decades now??? 2) why don't you at least write either a new forward to the book a magazine article etc. contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time (for some of us at least) primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians? i read evans' books before i moved here and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here. for a jew who really cares about her/his religion living here is depressing; it is practically jew-less; and at best the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me. (by the way i am planning to move to a city!) by the way don't bother writing to me to tell me that i am wrong or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church. believe me with all the praying for me that is going on in this town and all the myriad attempts to convert me if it hasn't happened by now as they say in these parts it just ain't gonna happen ",negative

" this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u.s. administrations. in that sense it is the story of two cities - miami and washington - and two peoples - americans and cubans. i have an objection though with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously even gorgeously at times written. didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and worse the result is a cold humorless colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup. the author in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. it is in that sense a boring little disaster of a book.

" i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years. however this book is misleading and dangerous. almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries). writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - mr. crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen and provide plenty of references to support this premise. tragically in the long term global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust. i hope that someday mr. crichton recognizes that in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books. there is a quote: with great power comes great responsibility. but in this case it would seem: with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet.

" god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic. and yes maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy. yes it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time a lampoon of the courtship ritual and of course oh so witty blah blah blah but it just wasn't my cup of tea. the main character was likeable but that aside i found it completely insufferable to read through and absolutely painfully boring. every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted let alone the ending. not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea walked and talked and had more tea then got married and lived happily ever after. the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama. it would save more time just to watch a chick flick. so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance) then this is the book for you!! if not then i suggest picking up some dan brown.

" having read detective comics #471-479 in the 70s done by this same creative team i picked this up hoping for more of the same. what a let-down! i have to ask - what happened!? the art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest most detailed art i'd ever seen in a comic-book. i think that was due mostly to the inking of terry austin. when he was working on x-men he gave john bryne's pencils that fine detail as well. has austin done a 'gil kane' and given up his nib-and-ink to work with marker-pen? this dark detective series shows none of the fine-ness of his previous work. you only have to compare the 'flash-backs' of this series to the original detective comics issues to see that something is wrong. maybe austin or rogers are getting older but the artwork is very basic and lacks the sheen they used to produce. the art sometimes actually reminded me of bob kane's early work. the story also is a little unbelievable. it portrays bruce as a love-sick puppy and just doesn't ring true. also the lettering is - well it's been hand-done by rogers i surmise and is quite uneven. it should have been done by computer. i'm sorry - i so wanted to like this but it's nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced in their glory days of the 70s.

" reviewer alianore's opinion rather too indulgent of its subject is a very accurate portrayal of weir's work. i will try to add something to that near perfect review. (note: i listened to the unabridged audiobook of queen isabella 22 hrs on 18 cds). the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable loaded with period details. the last third is the worst: weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay elevation -- of queen isabella to the role of long-suffering much-wronged highly-deserving and late-redeemed just queen of england. this book is really subjective rhetorical biographal dramatization. i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. it is rhetoric because of the endless weasel words (and expressions) used copiously throughout: some say it has been said many believe therefore we may assume it can be inferred ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. these expressions occur many hundreds of times commonly in conjunction with wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons. equally irksome is weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. she is always 'declaring' for us the contents of isabella's thoughts. remarkable gift she has for this. many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. but then moments later she will portray isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how isabella must have might have could have would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. this isn't historical writing it is historical op-ed with an obvious agenda. i don't loathe this work it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris' rise of theodore roosevelt and theodore rex. i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. yuck. really.) if prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. and much much less editorial subjectivity retroactive psychology biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. the only way i could enjoy isabella by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly taking it with several pounds of salt as the above referenced reviewer advises. 2.5/5 ",negative
" being an engineer in the aerospace industry i was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a hard industry. i personally believe that it's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that's the foundation of real wealth not legal services or newswires. so this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is and suggest ways to improve it. oh how very very wrong i was . . . this book started off strong . . . for about four pages. after that a litany of tortured logic un-sourced assertions facts taken completely out of context except for the author's subjectively added adjectives orwellian double-speak sleight of hand arguments flat out ridiculuos statements contradictory assessments and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left george soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century. even a broken watch is correct twice a day though so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating. these include: - manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs provided it's run right. (a big if.) - high wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive. - americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates. - there is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain. (i.e. enron) a scholarly fair and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful. this is not what you'll get in this book though. instead you'll get: a begining section about postindustrialism things like the internet information technology financial services etc. the things that make the services based economy. in three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument. not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men set them on fire and piss on the smoldering remains. this is where vitriol even comes out where he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even thinking. if someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument they probably don't have one. most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist. to me this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to oh i don't know let's say a fish. a middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing. this is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there's no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large. this is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data charts of gdp growth over time pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services manufacture agriculture etc. you will get none of that. there's little value except in reassuring the obvious high wage nations can do manufacturing. many of these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still don't quite dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though! you also know you're being left in the dark with a plethora of cya disclaimer statments like while industry_x has certainly had its share of problems recently . . . at the begining of a section. a final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire free markets and the concept of free trade. george soros and a bunch of other lefties with pat buchanan thrown in for balance should be listened to instead. the worst part of this book is the author's lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument. examples of twisted thinking abound: - a post-industrial industry grows five times over in a certain period. the author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad. later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60%! self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise. the author's challenge to the reader seems to be who are you going to believe? me or your lying eyes? - he rips into american post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world. later he talks about how great german manufacturing is because germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world's workers. - the only facts he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context. when describing service industries paltry $50 million revenues only 60000 jobs disappointing 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common. but when describing manufacturing a very high $6 million revenues a good mix of 1500 jobs and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow. a number in and of itself means nothing. the fact the author leaves out any head on direct comparison between industries is telling. - official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes. when the official figures don't agree with him he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong. when attacking his straw men though he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner. - gems of orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity. (pg. 184) i.e. it's competitive where there is no competition! and even in singapore one of the freest societies in the east the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . . (pg. 229) that's not very free if it's forced is it? (his defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages i've ever read and really is worth the price of the book. he capstones it with the most encouraging observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make!- to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out. wow what an achievement. any actual power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it's internal workings wear out but whatever . . .) - americans are dumb and the only successful american companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards. the american economy despite the statistics is in bad shape. the japanese instead are eight feet tall can read people's minds and see through lead. the japanese economy despite the statistics is in really great shape. this type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments. the author basically can't get out of his own way. - he always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they don't put numbers into context are using twisted logic making mere assertions instead of quoting facts etc. apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses! - he claims boeing is no longer a good company because 30% of components in a boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's. this is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper. america isn't doing that badly in aerospace by the way. the author fails to mention that 50% of the european airbus is made in america. this is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient. the list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions. you'd have to buy the book to see them all because there's at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page. all in all this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity. it's really a mercantilist argument and the only common thread that i could see in all the author's cloudy reasoning is that nation's should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what. it's not unfortunately a book about how to revitalize american manufacturing in a globalized world.

" casual book browsers who stumble across braden's book the isaiah effect might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title: that there exists some mystical unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques research and understanding. i as one such browser had briefly read about the so-called bible code which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related. with my interest piqued at the title and the book description i delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed isaiah's precise instructions of prayer. i wanted to know exactly what braden claimed to have stumbled upon. what i found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new-thought concepts. the mixing of religions for example - a sort of pick-and-choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades - is recycled over and over again drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books. in only one chapter does braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of isaiah. instead he relegates the books of the essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence. in the brief pages in which braden actually does discuss isaiah his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science. his basic premise of the effect is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present. such a revelation is not a new interpretation of isaiah at all. any student of the bible and christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the old testament are records of god warning israel and the world of turning away from him. to braden's credit his discussions of the effects of prayer in today's society are commemorable albeit somewhat misguided. i agree with him that people in today's society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they've surrounded themselves. however i believe braden over-emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer. he fails to discuss how humans and their emotions are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes. braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts. in the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created. humbleness before god and the filling of the holy spirit are the true keys to prayer - not cosmic emotions and human feelings. a disappointing read ",negative
" i must say i enjoyed the book but the ending was so sudden with so many things left hanging that i was disappointed. i wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did manderly catch fire what did they do when they got to the burning house and how did they pick up their lives. all we had at the ending was ashes. also the narrator who never gives her name was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home sneaking food hiding behind chairs. the book is worth reading but i wish that instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea du maurier had written a better ending.

" ageless body is deepak's attempt to neutralize the word old as in old age. the writer has a knack for making common words like body mind and self into profound concepts. his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies. but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound. if you like poetry deepak may be your read: the billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (p. 36) or try to interpret this one: the emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (p.40) at times he attributes to cells and dna a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible. he would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over intelligent design. he can't accept the growth of any cell even a plant cell without an intelligence involved. he mentions and attacks evolution only one time on p. 115 asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process. deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself. whether your word game tosses in the word quantum or not doesn't change much. what a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world. i wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness deepak speaks of wouldn't after awhile go insane ",negative

" i picked up this book expecting a fresh approach and analysis of dr. king apart from the obligatory images we're force-fed each new year. instead i was disappointed to find that eric dyson made heavy use of speculation with the intent to scandalize more than to inform and enlighten. one such example includes dyson conveying the idea that dr. king may have engaged in orgies with many different women along with his right-hand man ralph abernathy. he then goes on to infer that there was talk of king and abernathy engaging in sexual acts with each other! the author had no commentary to either support or dispel this theory making dyson's retelling of the alleged incident totally irresponsible and even libelous. he just dropped the information true or untrue in the readers lap to do with as the reader pleased. to that end it is my opinion that dyson's intent in writing this book was in no way honorable or truth-seeking rather it was a means to convey his baseless ideas to anyone who would listen. i'm reminded of something my grandmother and mother would always say to me an empty wagon makes the loudest noise. eric dyson makes a lot of noise in this book but totally lacks substance. this was an expensive tabloid ",negative

" i'll put my opinion first so there won't be any doubt in your mind. i don't believe that you can write useful books about national character. is there really such a thing as &quot;national character&quot;? people are just too different too unpredictable. how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you ? how well can you predict what people in your own country will do ? would every italian if they could write well have written the same book as mr. barzini ? i seriously doubt it. so what we have in the italians is one man's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians. after reading it i felt even more strongly that such books though possibly entertaining are a waste of time. an informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ? anthropologists have been concerned for many years in getting the &quot;inside view&quot;--the view of a culture as seen by the person within it. while barzini is indisputable italian he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there why they are as visitors see them or why they are not as foreigners may think. this is not a successful gambit. cultures are based on many general factors--like history socio-economic patterns religion family etc.---but the specific results are just that specific. barzini covers many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the state; italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; sicily and the mafia; and last the tragedy of italy's long domination by foreigners. but nothing really connects. there are only superficial scattered impressions nothing very concrete to grasp. the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes. barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history. these sections were well-written and interesting. but his portrayal of italian &quot;character&quot; is fuzzy contradictory and ultimately unconvincing. finally if you are a lover of lists you will thrill to this book because there is a list on nearly every single page. myself i got pretty tired of those lists. if you want to know something useful about italy read another book. if you just want entertainment which might support any stereotypes you have about italians then this book could be for you ",negative

" the literature of september 11 is never attacked. when a book speaks of september 11 (or of terrorism in general) it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy. jonathan safran foer's extremely loud and incredibly close banks on such sympathy on such reverence. the narrative which concerns a nine-year-old boy named oskar schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen in its basic outline from guenther grass's die blechtrommel) could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions. nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include hiroshima / nagasaki the staten island ferry crash and the dresden bombings. each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity but historical trauma itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation. oskar the insufferable brat attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father thomas schell jr. a victim of september 11 by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds the collage of images and letters which is the book we are reading---an almanac which most likely is written sometime in the indefinite future (thomas shell sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216). who has done the editing? almost certainly an older version of his grandson oskar). if the term reading even applies. whenever a pregnant image is described foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image. when a flock of birds rises into the sky it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well. words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs illustrations since mere verbality is not enough. (indeed the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.) photographs yes and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages. space is not used in the manner it is in the works of edmond jabes for instance. typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence. foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically the responsibility to write well. why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal? as far as the writing is concerned it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases (heavy boots raison d'etre etc.) and sunday school platitudes: sometimes one simply wants to disappear (184); there's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself (184); everything that's born has to die which means our lives are like skyscrapers (245); how can you say i love you to someone you love?... it's always necessary (314). whenever the author writes something that he finds beautiful and true (165) he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is beautiful and true. the entire book reeks of such unearned profundity. we also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed one that foer also communicates in his essay emptiness (originally published in playboy) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel a sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (ringo star) and scientists (stephen hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized. perhaps it is wrong to criticize foer for including so many blank pages in extremely loud and incredibly close since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings. joseph suglia ph.d. the author of watch out ",negative
" i was really looking forward to reading ever after when i saw the favorable quote on the back cover by larry gelbart. but the book turned out to be a very cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight. here are the three things i learned from this book: (1) mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt; (2) andrew lloyd webber is the anti-christ; (3) the only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started off-broadway (mostly at playwrights horizons and lincoln center). most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each with very few illuminating details. here's what the author says about carrie perhaps the most famous recent broadway musical flop: carrie of course was an instant classic a monument in the pantheon of failed broadway musicals. adapated by michael gore (music) and don pitchford (lyrics) from the notorious stephen king novel (and even more notorious film) this $7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the virginia theater on the 12th of may 1988 and was gone by the 15th touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible monumental ineptitude. does that really tell us very much about this musical? did barry singer even see the show? you sure wouldn't know it from this description. and just what i wonder makes king's novel notorious or the movie even more notorious? almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention but somehow singer finds time for an entire chapter of lloyd webber-bashing where sir andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery. the chapter sticks out like a sore thumb if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book but also because it's one of the few times that singer goes into any detail. aside from a few interesting sondheim quotes this book is a waste of time.

" updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development. as other have stated you know from page one that the final page will involve an arab a truck and a bomb. the lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else - perhaps excellent writing interesting character development or original insights. updike fails to deliver on all three counts. one particularly slipshod literary technique updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character ahmad. when ahmad speaks it is in the voice of an intelligent thoughtful foreigner. his phrasing captures very well the cadence vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non-native speaker of english. curiously ahmad is an american raised in new jersey by a thoroughly american mother. so what influences created this stilted phrasing? updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a jersey teenager speaks like a pakistani or egyptian immigrant. there is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character's life is grating. updike also relies heavily on ethnic/religious stereotypes. sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature. however in updike's case the stereotypes make little sense at all. for instance a high school counselor's entire personality is attributed to his jewishness both by himself and by others who opine on his personality. this is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a jew and in fact his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier. so where does all the jewsih influence come from? likewise ahmad's mother's personality is often linked to her irish heritage. yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her irish background (which could have been many generations ago) has influenced her one bit. the reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype - other than simply poor writing and careless character development. another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the korna in arabic. obviously few western readers will understand arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages. what comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research. if that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in western script rather than arabic script. after all the koran is not written with western phonetics in mind. ultimately the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author ",negative
" sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow subject than the author. when the author is in error about that subject the reader may question the accuracy of the descriptions in the rest of the book. such is the case here. i've written 123 books; several on parachutes and skydiving. i am a pilot skydiver and parachute rigger; i know the sport and the industry. the author wrote: we use flat chutes as parasails. what is flat? square? rectangular? ram-air? a parasail is a kite and is usually under tow behind a boat. this sentence does not make any sense. four miles up he pulled. that would be 21120 feet. the use of oxygen is not mentioned. ferocious out of control spiral. one of the cells collapsed. the collapse of a single cell will not cause a fast turn and the cell is easily re-inflated. corkscrewing caused the other cells to collapse. not likely. guide lines an uncommon reference. they are referred to as control lines or toggles. he jettisoned the main canopy at 15000 feet. he freefell ten seconds and opened his reserve at 12700 feet. the rest of the team on this haho jump would still be at 18000 feet. five minutes later. he would be at about 8000 feet. he estimated he had about 15 minutes of glide remaining. more like eight minutes. he was so relaxed he was startled to hear canopies fluttering all around him and the sound of men splashing down just under him. how did they all beat him to the landing area? they were 5000 feet above him. fiction writers have a responsibility to make their descriptions accurate. when a reader finds obvious discrepancies in one area it makes him or her wonder if the rest of the book is accurate. and the writing is not creative. dan poynter the parachute manual & the skydiver's handbook. danpoynter@parapublishing.com.

" this book should get 0 stars; speaking as an artist myself the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous. the basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics etc. to me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse. admittedly i could not even finish this book; after reading for the nth time a line of shaky circumstantial evidence like all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw but there are no correction marks therefore optics must have been used i could not even stand to keep reading! on the contrary all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction. that is just one example... the book is filled with flaky examples such as those - hockney claiming this is too good to have been done without optics or this was too difficult to have been done without optics - and i found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art if that is indeed what he thinks. and modern artists must remember this: nowadays the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists for many reasons. superior art education is very hard to find and there are many distractions in the modern world (tv computers having to hold a 'day job' lack of patrons etc.) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did. therefore most will never attain the skill of the old masters. but that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology! some of the other examples used as 'evidence' refer to 'odd' proportion perspective etc. in otherwise masterful work. i am surprised that this author (and those readers who are artists) apparently does not realize that throughout history great artists did not necessarily strive for exact realism - even nowadays photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists because after all we are artists not cameras! the point of realist art is to accentuate the reality not to copy it! therefore many inconsistencies in proportion perspective etc. evident in old masters' work are not 'oddities' or 'mistakes' but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition. all that being said i think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of 'trickery' or technology of some sort. instead an art student should be encouraged to build skill discipline and self-reliance - because that is the true secret of the great masters ",negative

" yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to write. my single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules. comma splices and run-on sentences are not and never will be acceptable to me. occasional use can be overlooked but shaara peppers every page with them tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject. the effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading. the following example is made-up but it is a good imitation of how shaara writes: he turned in the saddle rode toward his headquarters over the ridge refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance focused instead on the day ahead forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand. one often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this. the result is a book that reads like a rough draft or maybe not even that; it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft. i don't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work and i don't understand why readers put up with it. another problem is the lack of convincing characterization. everyone is vaguely noble here with the exception of a few complete cads. washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home. cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home. greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home. i think you get the picture. few characters stand out on their own. even lafayette is just another young officer. the author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book. and shaara's attempts at making his characters witty never work. the result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull. beyond that i'm doubtful about the author's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter. it's fine when we leap across the atlantic and jump into franklin's mind. but the rest of the time it doesn't work well. i find that i sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus. either i'm a lazy reader (and i'm not) or the device isn't working well. in addition this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on franklin in france and washington green cornwallis and howe in america. that means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in parliament and the royal court in england and the continental congress in america. in effect this novel is really about washington's military camp and howe's dinner table which makes the narrative unbalanced. some aspects of the story are interesting. i enjoy reading about washington's maneuvers and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the british have eluded him. i learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were and when. but i wish now that i'd just bought a decent beginner's history on the war. most of the book as literary fiction left me cold ",negative
" this is a good book but most are under the impression that einstein actually created the content of the book. einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest german and italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory. for instance e=mc^2 was not created by einstein as so many people people. an italian physicist came up with it. if you don't believe me check any encyclopedia. einstein suceeded in taking everyone's work and compiling it. this was helpful to the world of physics. unfortunately this stuff is outdated and autodynamics has disproven many things that einstein says in this book. when it came out it was already outdated. this was published in the 60s. autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s (45 i believe). if this was published in the 20s or even the 30s it would have been a good book ",negative

" i will not try to say that i asserted the painstaking analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of heidegger. more than that i have no interest in doing so. it is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being (existence) and my reading didn't lead me to any other conclusions. so as i said i have no interest in reading this a second time further deeper or slower. being and time is chock full of invented terminology to the extent that michael inwood was able to profit from his publication of a heidegger dictionary. whatever you might think the word world means for instance is not what heidegger means and he will explain that to you throughout the duration of an agonizing 40 pages or so. this is the case with his entire vocabulary. if there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by heidegger i would not bring this up as a crticism. beyond the unventilated severely sober and utterly uninspiring character of being in time i also call attention to the futility of it's project. if heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being perhaps more than 2000 years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him: that there is no question of being. why is the question of being so problematic? because it is unanswerable maybe. or if it is answerable we're not in any position to answer it. being implies some kind of unvarying stability that just doesn't make sense. and if you posit an idea that is so concrete so constant you can't just bend it to make it fit reality. you've already betrayed your questioning. truth including the truth of being is a local phenomenon. truth is not always and forever true - it's true when it's true. but heidegger wanted an everlasting truth a dogmatic anthropology. worse than the general uselessness of his project and the toxic dregs left in his wake heidegger is guilty of not even presenting his ideas in an intersting or thought-provoking way ",negative

" i generally like elmore leonard this is the twelfth book of his i've read ranging from his detroit crime capers to his l.a.-set chili palmer stuff to some of his westerns. other than the terrible be cool this is probably my least favorite of his books so far. set in the years between the end of world war i and 1934 the story follows carlos carl webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot u.s. marshall. the story takes place in the dusty midwest mainly around tulsa and oklahoma city as carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves. carl is a somewhat vain cocky lawman with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers. his main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man a no account young man who has everything he needs but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into carl's path. mixed into this are kinds of period details from prohibition to will rogers shows to klansmen vigilantes to true detective writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers pretty boy floyd john dillinger and bonnie and clyde barrow. despite all this background detail the story itself failed to engage me. there are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize leonard's best work. there's a good guy a bad guy and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic. in fact about halfway through the book i realized that the real story wasn't going to kick in -- i was in it! and unlike many leonard books the supporting cast of characters isn't particularly memorable. even leonard's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech. ultimately one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story. that said the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story given the time and place. all in all unless you're really really into the whole '30s gangster thing not worth the time.

" this book was so badly written that i just couldn't help writing my first review on amazon. i never bothered writting reviews. while i fully respect the authors' decision in providing the book online under the creative commons license and while i do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions the book is a total f*ck up. and f*ck up is an understatement. the book: 1) is unorganized :- i felt i was being bombarded by information from all directions. one moment i was getting ready to test a simple hello world module and the other i'm suddenly faced with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing how function calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new functionality to a running kernel. with strange function names that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of the chapter. how the hell did i get here? it just pisses you off and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and frustrated. 2) is upside-down:- i read chapter 3 (char drivers) and i compare it to real device drivers and some things just don't match. the book seems very theoretical because the real device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned at all. after digging in the kernel source files and googling the internet i realize that in the real world there is a whole driver-model and generic objects and what not. reading the source code documentation and some online material i actually understand how the real drivers work. i still don't understand the stuff in the book. i start wondering whether there is any mention of the driver-model and i find it in chapter 14 !!!!!!! the driver model seems in my opinion the first step to understanding how real drivers work and i find it after 14 chapters of utter nonsensce!! not only that the authors decide that many driver authors can ignore the device model entirely and the complexity of the device model makes it hard to understand by starting with a high-level view... surpisingly it was easier to understand from online sources and the source code documentation than trying to read chapter 2 in the book! 3) is sadistic:- one thing i really hated was the carrot-and-stick approach the authors chose. first they give you a small tiny taste of a topic which finally seems relevant and just when you feel you're about to reach somewhere they do a complete u-turn and throw all kinds of irrelevant off-the-topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so shamefull as to expect any better. you end up confused annoyed and duped. like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the hello world module. ok fine. seems easy enough. you naturally assume that this is an invitation to write the same code yourself. haha wroong! the book suddenly does a make hello.c without showing you the content of the makefile. it leaves you out to dry with your uncompilable-hello.c and goes on describing in detail seemingly random stuff. you are left wondering whether the makefile must have been something too obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter as-is. i chose the former. hahaha wroong agaaiin! i ended up compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they decide to mention only 7 sections later.(at least they mentioned it?!) in summary.. i'd suggest you buy the book.. and (as ./documentation/managementstyle for another book says): not read it. burn it it's a great symbolic gesture. i don't think anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical book. if you come across any online material that recommends this book *quickly* discard that material too .. without thinking. this is a -5 stars book. it has affected me personally ",negative

" let me first say that once upon a time i liked larry the cable guy. after reading this book i now think he is one step above slime. to be fair some jokes are funny and some stories are enjoyable and amusing. he is anti-pc which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like rosie o'donnell michael moore barney frank barbara streisand and that fat girl from the dixie chicks among others. no problem there in my opinion. that is the entirety of the positive things i can say about the book. the rest is just babble often repeated over and over again that even larry lovers will find annoying. a couple things that really bothered me. the first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of retards and down's syndrome children. he must use the term retard at least fifty+ times in the book. this is appreciably different than making a joke about say michael moore. moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes. the down's syndrome children did not. my opinion of larry the cable guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on retards. he also racially sterotypes in the book. many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond. the down's syndrome kids can't. larry i can only hope god (in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book) grants you a retard child to love and care for. then i would like to read your next book. i suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly. the second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that larry is a fraud in many senses. he plays the good 'ol bubba. he ain't too bright and he ain't ever changed since he left the farm. his celebrity - his word not mine - has not gone to his head. ok larry. why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures including serious topics such as abortion? why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down? why the unrelenting references to your celebrity? the terms meet and greet and after-party were used over and over and over as an example. do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are? well you are wrong. they are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become. that's hollywood-speak my country fart loving nose picking friend. overall this book is a true disappointment and larry the cable guy is a true moron (see doesn't that sound better than retard). my father always taught me there are two types of dumb people. those who are dumb and know they are dumb. and those who are dumb but are so dumb they don't realize it. the former category usually shuts up (knowing they are dumb). the latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter. the first group is obviously smarter than the second. larry the cable guy falls smack dab in the last group. the fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book. make jokes larry and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like. unfortunately larry can't see the obvious. like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book he has become exactly one of them. a thin layer of good 'ol boy on top covering a core of venom and celebrity. he plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets. my suggestion: don't buy larry's act and by all means don't buy the book.

" now i enjoy victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact probably more than the next person since the average next person hasn't ever read any. tales of derring-do adventures to unexplored distant lands lost civilizations great artifacts etc. -- that's all good stuff. what's not good is this book which is tedious in the extreme. on the surface of it haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) king solomon's mines has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!) a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man an expedition to africa and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life. however despite this promising laundry list haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. a friend described it rather aptly as a book with a lot of story but not a lot of plot. which is to say that in my edition some 320 pages are filled without much happening. there is the initial mysterious set-up the journey to dark africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations the heroes' conveyance to the lost city and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. lengthy descriptive details lengthy internal ruminations lengthy rambling speeches lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life. i suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the gazette. as i understand it serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment and thus it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. of course as another friend pointed out it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time he suggests may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. in any event there are some nice scenes here and there such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches but those are about all i'm likely to recall from this book in a year. of course as is noted in the introduction to my edition haggard lifted the main elements of the plot and even the the true name of she-who-must-not-be-named from several earlier adventure novels by edward bulwer-lytton so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. i suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of victorian englishmen: racism anti-semeticism misogyny fear of miscegenation etc. but as entertainment for the modern reader it falls woefully short of the mark.

" thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story. we like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot and find out who did it and why the crime was done. john grisham cheats us out of that fun. the villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left which means that when you get that far you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. to have some red herrings in a thriller is fine but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings? that's bad. read another thriller instead of this one one that plays by the rules ",negative

" i'm on page 110 of this book. the book has 220 pages. i'm half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person i am angry with. i bought this book because i have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. but it is having the opposite affect. i feel i was duped into buying it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews). part 1 tells us what a grievance is. it tells us and tells us again and again and again. the thing is i already know what a grievance is! i know i'm angry at someone and i know it's not healthy i know to forgive would help me.... i didn't need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. all that reading did was make me dwell and think more about the problem and increased my anger because of the book itself. when i reached part 2 entitles forgiveness i thought finally.... but all part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it will help me. there are some great reviews of this book here at amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. but so far i can't agree with any of the positive comments. i have a great degree of respect for stanford university i went to high school across the street from stanford and have taken classes there but it pains me to have such a great school's name attached to this book. is it fair of me to write a review of a book i have not finished? no... but i'm afraid to continue reading it. i'm already angry and to buy a book that i thought would help me only to find it frustrating me i don't feel is not all that fair either......

" the other boleyn girl and the queen's fool are two of the best books i've ever read--and i've read a lot of books especially about this period which especially fascinates me. they were gripping to the end and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out i buy it hoping to have the same experience and lately have been sorely disappointed. the virgin's lover fell flat and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged must give it up. one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess however it depends on the writer. anthony trollope for instance was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. that may or may not be the case with gregory. i know as a writer myself that there are times when the work flows out feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source and times when it's harder more mechanical. the more challenging situations are those when i'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. so to me neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. they feel forced constructed. i'm going back to trollope ",negative
" the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again. i was disappointed soon after when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing. i mean graceland for a first date? i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights and logan and nate from that same book. none of them can talk in complete sentences. and stella who comes across as this loving mother who puts her kids before anything else works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything even though the place has been successful for years. there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband she just does it. unless of course it was in the last 50 pages which i didn't bother to read because i just couldn't torture myself any longer. and i'm a big fan of roberts. i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work. but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be. i'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out.

" the sub-title of this book is very misleading. it does not contain an action-oriented approach to raising your self-esteem - unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action. the book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page (one of the things i dislike about myself is... one of my emotions i have trouble accepting is...) and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind. for some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper; and there are a lot of them so be prepared to go through a lot of paper. sure completing sentences technically counts as an action. but if you're like me action-oriented implies some sort of cognitive-behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts. for someone with social anxiety the last thing i needed was more solitary introspection. branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy; but alas the practice helped me in no way. your mileage may vary but i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone ",negative
" i'd never read berry before but as far as i can tell this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory. however it's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm. there are two related problems with the book: one of presentation and one of tone. the problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there's no room for specifics. so while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of berry's vision there's no detail to back it all up. the problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at. of course some of the pieces are lectures but there's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book. it comes out when berry uses certain words such as the three as of appropriate authentic and adequate. when these are used ( as they often are) there he's obviously made some kind of value judgment but the reader is never let in on it. the end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic -- which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir. which is unfortunate since i tend to agree with berry on a lot of things (though not his anti-abortion stance). small farms are good agribusiness is bad stewardship of the land is good extraction industries are bad treating the body as an organic whole is good and things of that nature. alas he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful. two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate: this is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed. and communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people country life and country places. berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses. for example in one essay he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine untouched state and that's all. while there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with berry's views on stewardship and land use. it certainly doesn't help matters that his view of small-scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose-colored glasses. his claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition. however it ignores the fact that historically small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins was subject to all kind of external instability (weather vermin etc.) and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level. in farming cash is scarce that's why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself such as in wwii when all those defense-industry factories were opened in california. (of course in berry's vision you don't really need cash because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors.) berry's exhortations to create small-scale communities is worthy stuff and even in cities people are creating this. the growth of csas farmers markets and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this. however to achieve the large scale results berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection ",negative
" i have never been a fan of danielle steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime and those many years ago. i'm not sure what motivated me to pick up toxic bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but i slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work. actually i think i was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was. the writing was completely repetitive and superficial and i rather felt that i was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself. it read like a poor book report: ...and then he did this and then he did this and after that he did this and then he laughed. we are told that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic a little neurotic and fairly immature despite their (middle) age but not necessarily toxic -- are decent likable guys but we never really see too much proof of that. when the proof does come it's so ham-handed as to be laughable: charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character. yeahsurerightwhatever. most of the story is told through narration with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue. the author adopted a third-person point of view but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters. throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable. this is how men behave and relate to one another? i find that hard to believe considering that none of the men i know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other. i liked the female characters of the book initially. they all seemed to be strong capable independent and emotionally healthy women. but my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man. and the conflicts steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous: mountains out of molehills. for instance gray the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family refuses to meet the adult children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love. nevermind the fact that he's known about the adult children since the very beginning. nevermind the fact that the adult children live in england and italy while gray and sylvia are new yorkers. nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent self-sufficient adults who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits. evidently gray can't see beyond the fact that they are kids and therefore family and therefore not to be tolerated. sorry but whatever sympathy i'd developed for gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity. dump the weenie sylvia. you can do better. the other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness and of course everything was wrapped up magically with sudden capitulation as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses. considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters their conflicts and resolution i have to wonder why steel even bothered writing this book. and why i bothered reading i ",negative

" i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it and being through with it now i feel as though i've learned very little. i had so many problems with this book or rather the way of writing mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author that this was a difficult read. in his defense he is in most things very thorough. my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was (or as he sometimes put it &quot;must have been&quot;) thinking or feeling. while i give mr. bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject in my opinion that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views. since he himself stresses that leonardo's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations. in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo's life the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter but only puts forward his own opinion and his reasons why he believes what he does without explaining the opposite side of the matter. in this manner he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter. sentences beginning with &quot;i think&quot; or &quot;in my view&quot; are not uncommon. he also makes certain assumptions about the reader referring often to other artists' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them. also he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo's often drawing attention to coloring or texture without ever showing it though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout. the author is an undoubtedly intelligent well-learned man very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned but entirely overbearing in his writing. overall unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and don't mind being pulled out of a book by the author's views then i would highly suggest staying away from this one ",negative

" this is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860's narrated by a civil war deserter. within the first few pages our hero enlists pilfers letters off battlefield corpses deserts is injured in nyc draft riots ends up in new bedford ma and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going. the book was downhill from there. page after page described ice and the crew's interminable struggles to get through. getting through the book was nearly as interminable. the reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him or really understand him at all. thus his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles. there are elements of fantasy in the book. not enough to make it a fantasy but enough to steer a reader off course. the scientist on the mission is after a warm garden of eden in the middle of the arctic. he is mad or it's fantasy it is hard to know until the end. there is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands (the most likeable character in the book) describes how he got his third hand. from that yarn comes the title rope eater. the title really has nothing to do with the book other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain. besides the tedious turning of the plot the characters lack any development. only the three handed man and the captain both tangential characters had any depth whatsoever. this book seemed to be an attempt at adventure but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension. it never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it just happened. although the reader knew the characters must be suffering it never came through the over-writing. as one might expect the crew's mission to find the warm garden of eden in the arctic was pointless. so was this book. it was a disappointment.

" so this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put catholic and fellow christian faithful in a defensive uproar. i'm fairly well read and yes i've earned a few bucks with my prose. i'm also a sucker for historic tales ancient folklore mythology and old testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. ok i decided now that it's in paperback i'll give it a read. what i concluded was this: those who found the da vinci code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that brown's work is a literary steaming pile. i read page after page waiting for the moment when i would start to give a rat's ass about the da vinci code's protagonists. what a bunch of twits. langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (i don't know if i spelled that right but i'm not about to go back in that book and check it). apparently there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that langdon's books sell better than brown's entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly french chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like landgon. she's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most french probably couldn't tolerate it. and then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic british snob teabing. from cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but of course) versaille this memeber of the royal lucky sperm club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a euro. so he's been free to pursue his fascination with bigfoot rumors about how the priory of sion opus dei and those cool holy grail knights from the third indiana jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that jesus made a baby girl and god had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. or something like that. oh i forgot teabing's crippled so i should feel bad about talking bad about him. anyway this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. the point is that these characters aren't very approachable and brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy christian faith as we know it. hell it's been more than 100 years since darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution yet the christian faithtul still pack churches around world. but back to how bad this book is. trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. i would give you some examples but like i said i'm not going back in there. one of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when langdon and sophie meet up with teabing in his metrosexual parlor. by now sophie and langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times been on the run and are exhausted. with a straight face brown describes how sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. yes crumpets. hell teabing shut up about your conspiracy theories roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. offer langdon a stiff drink. i sure needed one at this point. by now i'm pulling for the albino. then they escape the jaws of death yet again and naturally high-tail it to england on teabing's private jet. i hoped maybe teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his grey poupon behind. i stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. i don't know how it ends. i don't care. however there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the history channel and discovery. who knows? you might like it. this is just my opinion ",negative

" a favourite writer goes to prison keeps a diary which proves to be an enjoyable read then upon his release writes the worst book of his career. the concept of the book is good as is the idea to blend the characters into the 9-11 tragedy. the first 20 pages flow with typical archer style. then the characters begin to make a series of continuously irrational decisions. my personnal favourite is when 2 characters independantly consider driving either to canada or mexico in order to fly to europe during the 9-11 grounding of air traffic. the idea that new yorkers wouldn't know that montreal is the nearest international airport seem laughable. while there is a direct highway to montreal archer sends the main character to toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes is in the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive. once at the border the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art historian who apparantly doesn't know that mcgill university is in montreal not toronto as is claimed by our hero. the guard then remarks that he will meet a collegue of the hero when that peron travels up to the conference. the idea that only one border guard is working the dozens of eastern us/canadian border crossings with multi-lane checkpoints 24/7 is simply the work of a mind out of touch with reality. its fine to change details to enhance the plot and structure of a story but there is simply no benefit to this sillyness. dan cormie ",negative

" i read bill bryson's a walk in the woods and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the educated aspect bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents). i started into in a sunburned country with similar expectations and especially since i have always longed and planned to visit australia. to state that i was disappointed is a severe understatement. after reading this book i now have little to no desire to visit the land down under; my only hope is that i will completely forget what i read in bryson's book so that i may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting australia. (senility be merciful and consume me hastily!) my best estimate is that bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about australia. during and / or after his trip his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own. i have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as i did with this one. bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a story relayed second-hand from one of the australians he met. such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books. the only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents. these at least provided for some interesting reading. after comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of bryson's books (i'm a stranger here myself) after she read a walk in the woods it would appear that in a sunburned country is not the only snore-fest that bryson has churned out. perhaps he isn't a one hit wonder but i for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out. so if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that bryson provided in a walk in the woods look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed.

" being a lover of freedom when the [nazi] revolution came i looked to the universities to defend it knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but no the universities were immediately silenced. then i looked to the great editors of the newspapers whose flaming editorials in days gone had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they like the universities were silenced in a few short weeks.... only the church stood squarely across the path of hitler's campaign for suppressing the truth. i never had any special interest in the church before but now i feel a great affection and admiration for it because the church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual and moral freedom. i am forced to confess that what i once despised i now praise unreservedly. -- albert einstein. what i'm getting at here is that you can propogate anyone to look bad that's easy. when you have two sources contradicting each other so heavily you may want to consider the source; i.e a protestant british author writing over fifty years after the fact vice a prominent and liberal jewish figure who lived through the holcaust and has no biased motive to either slander or praise the beforementioned institution. or maybe israel zolli chief rabbi of rome whose conversion to catholicism immediately after the war was prompted by the church's reaction to the plight of the jewish people. this book is extremely propagated and heavily editorialized. it is important to read a work like this however in order to better understand the manipulation of truth and half truth in the author's motive ",negative

" native tongue by carl hiaasen this book is fast paced has a lot of energy and a zany weirdness. no doubt it is a page-turner. and it is better than the other book of hiaasen's i have read double whammy. but all that does not a good read make... a strength of hiaasen's books are his characters well defined and numerous. most are straightforward stereotypes from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist the vapid sex-phone girlfriend a steroid-doped strongman the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars and loads of redneck florida crackers. hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops and by casting two characters that are quite original an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman. and we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins. etc. etc. so what's wrong. mainly it's that the book stays at a level of tv-sitcom-gone-book. it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject. one might think that the exception is the environment but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here. so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment? if you like brainless action gratuitous violence gross humor and zany fun native tongue might satisfy. i have one additional problem with hiassen and it's similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton. these books stink of hypocrisy. crichton makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science. hiassen's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society but hiaasen's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness. while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent ",negative
" in his recently published history the whiskey rebellion william hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century whiskey rebellion in western pennsylvania. what hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of howard zinn. he has an axe to grind and by the end alexander hamilton is the devil incarnate and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the american revolution to its necessary conclusion. the accusation that hogeland comes back to again and again is that hamilton incited the rebellion. the argument is that because hamilton's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen's resistance and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion. the problem with hogeland's argument is his scholarship or lack there of. he almost never offers a direct quote especially when accusing hamilton of malfeasance. instead hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote. the reader is expected to accept on faith the author's interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end. not all of this is hogeland's fault. the new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop. even doris kearns goodwin a legitimate scholar is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze. ultimately this is the main problem with william hogeland: he is not a scholar. he is a magazine writer with an agenda and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions. to read some radical agenda into the actions of the pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history because there is no basis in reality.

" ...minus several million for good thinking... - zaphod beeblebrox the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy the above quote (and the score i've assigned to this book) aren't in reference to the text or the author but to the publishers. why anyone with the brains of a sea urchin would cross professor hawking as they seem to have done is beyond me. briefly save your money and buy the illustrated brief history of time instead of the theory of everything even if you're a compulsive hawking completist. alert readers should notice that hawking doesn't hold the copyright for theory of everything and attempted to block its publication. it was originally titled the cambridge lectures: life works and appears to have been drawn from some recordings of lectures given by the professor years ago. (see the professor's web site for details.) the vanilla (i.e. not the illustrated) theory of everything consists of an introduction seven lectures and an index without *any* illustrations or diagrams. out of curiosity i compared a library copy of it with the illustrated brief history of time. unless otherwise noted each of the 7 lectures corresponds to a chapter of the same name in brief history in some segments only with slightly different paragraphing and punctuation (and occasionally the kind of spelling errors that creep in when one transcribes audio narration to text if i may speculate as to the cause). i don't understand why anyone would prefer the less polished text of theory of everything to the illustrated brief history of time which not only has updates for new areas of research but has been revised and rearranged to explain things more gently to the layperson. ideas about the universe is essentially an extract from our picture of the universe the first chapter of brief history with about one sentence's worth of drift per paragraph. brief history's version of the expanding universe has a more gradual introduction to the methods of measuring distances to nearby stars and explains technical terms that may be unfamiliar to the non-scientist such as luminosity. theory of everything really shows its age in black holes when compared to brief history as hawking has not been idle in that area over the years. the illustrated edition of brief history has had a fair bit of interesting material added to black holes especially regarding cosmic censorship and naked singularities (hawking having made a few *more* bets on the subject with preskill and thorne although he paid off the cygnus x-1 wager). black holes ain't so black lacks major blocks of clarification/explanation added by hawking to the version in brief history. brief history's version of the origin and fate of the universe goes into more detail: about the kinds of particles that are predicted to have come out of the big bang and what sort of results we'd expect to see today if the predictions hold and the scientists who first put forward these theories. brief history also contains a much longer version of the open questions section leading more gradually up to the discussion of guth's development of the inflationary model. the direction of time corresponds to brief history's the arrow of time (which is worth picking up just for the picture of the keeper of the u.s. cesium clock). brief history goes into more detailed examples to explain what hawking means by the psychological arrow of time with the simplest kind of computer: an abacus. the theory of everything mainly corresponds to brief history's more modestly titled the unification of physics which is much more up to date (string theories are still covered but a lot more work has been done in that area over the years). the tail end of the lecture corresponds to the ending of brief history's conclusion. -- in summary this is interesting stuff but the illustrated brief history of time does it better ",negative

" no intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal john dewey and his experimental school. who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of progressivism? i would. dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming from nature study. this he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. the problems in dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. as if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. even more outrageous in dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. how could dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes not further disguise and exacerbate low performance? deweyism of course like many other off-the-wall theories of education denies behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. it depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted particularly project follow through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. i'd personally like to see dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids who come into class with their natural inquisitiveness programmed by tv rap music and other pop media into colonial american history calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes tennessee williams and the plus-que-parfait tense. but of course such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system. 90% of students in high schools today report that they do not feel adequately challenged. maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. dewey's progressivism relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. from the absurdity of it i can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates lowered standards and social discord. but a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one ",negative

" i was intrigued by his &quot;the end of history.&quot; i thought his &quot;trust&quot; was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my masters thesis and doctoral dissertation. i only hope this latest book is a disruption in an ongoing chain of good books. in the end &quot;the great disruption&quot; is a down right silly book. it has a lot of usefull data but fukuyama's humanistic ideology clouds it all. all his empirical data and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion: that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good. fukuyama proves that the moral consensus -- the social capital -- of the earlier era has been wiped away. that crime has sky-rocketed and that the apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men. then he turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to rebuild social capital. he doesn't bother to deal with societies -- like ethiopia -- that have never been able to build up enough social capital. he doesn't really look any further back in history past about 1950. his generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken into account the big picture of history. he thinks (based on his ideology of human goodness) that things just have to get better. if he had studied pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history he would know better. people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to make generalizations about long-term historical cycles. for that i would recommend robert w. fogel's &quot;the fourth great awakening and the future of egalitarianism.&quot; fogel a nobel prize winner has all the optimism of fukuyama but with the history to back it up ",negative

" i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara's pulitzer prize winning killer angels and because i'm a baseball fan. the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher. it's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot. the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories. the feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there. any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away flaws that distract and damage the work. shaara sets most of the novel in yankee stadium with the hawks playing the yankees. why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear. the hawks apparently are from atlanta but an atlanta team braves or hawks whichever would not be playing the yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season. finally when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in yankee stadium--not on the mound on the field. this book was published posthumously and mr. shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in killer angels. it's unfortunate. there are glimmers of interest in the book but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book ",negative
" i was reading about my son. it all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense. really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. then half way the book screeched in a new direction. all of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view. when it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens they want to take that one back which weakens the premise they present. the authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position - which i would have respected if not agreed with. then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes christ into the conversation/solution. if i knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system i wouldn't have spent the $22. i would have wanted to know that in advance. tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book. buyer bewar ",negative

" having read a few bosch books already (the closers and lost light) i realized that i should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how bosch became the bosch i was reading in the later series. however i was very disappointed with this book. one of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such). i found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before i stopped reading)! i thought it was ironic that connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book. also i found the book to be too gritty. it lacked the emotion and soul that i found in the later books. it seemed that connelly was trying too hard to make bosch fit this certain mold but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that i read. so it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because i just finished reading the narrows and loved it and will probably pick up some other bosch books and just read it out of order. connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better which should explain why i didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it. i gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe i was too impatient. this is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order ",negative
" i have read baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them. this one however is just awful. not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie. the only thing i can think of to compare it to is this : there was a series of calvin and hobbes cartoons where calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows with lame lines like the gun was loaded and so was i. that is exactly what this book is like except it goes on for 400 pages. there isn't a single interesting character in this book in my opinion. you just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end. it's the bataan death march of novels. i hope this is an aberration - i'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that i read were so good. but one more stinker like this one and i'll drop his name from my reading list ",negative

" the plot of this book was interesting and it could have been a good book. unfortunately it wasn't. the main problem for me was that the hero is dispicable and the heroine has absolutely no self esteem! even many of the the secondary characters are weak miserable people! the story starts when the hero finds himself drawn to the heroine even though he considers her a dirty little nobody. once she gets a makeover and is actually beautiful he begins pressuring her to become his mistress even though she is an innocent marriageable female by regency standards. because she is the daughter of a cit he can't imagine why she has any reservations about the deal. he says charming things to her like how much do you think your virginity is worth anyway. now that's romance! meanwhile even though she is unbelievably insulted by the hero many times she finds herself drawn to him too. for me their relationship was sort of like an abuser and his victim. she never stood up for herself and you felt sorry for her. of course the plot twist involves a mystery about her parentage... only its not really a mystery because almost everyone knows the hero is a dukes granddaughter including her. in fact just about the only one who doesn't know is the hero which provides the dilemma. he would of course be willing to marry her if only he knew she really wasn't a nobody! will anyone tell him? will he wise up and offer to marry her even though she isn't good enough for him? will she give in to her desires and become his mistress since he doesn't think she is good enough for him to marry? of course it all works out and he actually proposes to before he finds out she actually is good enough for him. ugh!!! this could have been a good book if the mystery had been handled better and the characters were written differently. as is it is a sad regency tale ",negative

" i'm the sort of guy who has a bit of trouble adapting to normal life. i'm still bemused and puzzled the mechanics of toilet-flushing. my wife (may she rest in peace) bought me this book as an anniversary present last month before she was tragically torn apart by a rabid pack of alligators at a wyoming nature preserve. anyway life moves on. much to my disappointment this book did not teach me everything i should know how to do. but fred you might be saying (and i'll be saying fred isn't my name idiot!) how do you know what you should know if you don't know what it is to begin with? ah well let me explain. see if tchikavoslky taught me one thought it was this: i know nothing. so it is with this deep insight into my own mind that i came up with the following things i should know based on what i currently do not know: 1. how to start a hurricane. this is very important. 2. how to kill a man with a toothpick. what if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and found out your were his next victim? scary. 3. how to run a nuclear powerplant with a one-man army. i don't want to be the next homer simpson! 4. how to raise children. i've raised ten and still haven't figured out what a diaper is. 5. what a diaper is. i don't know my wife used to talk about them a lot. 6. how to drive. sure technically we're supposed to learn how before we get our driver's licenses but like many people i just got a fake one when i was 12 and have been driving since then. i've been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged with five counts of manslaughter so i figured it might be good to learn how to drive. 7. how to stalk a celebrity. you just never know. 8. how to put on underwear without leaving stain marks. you fellas know what i'm saying! 9. how to make coffee. people ask me to all the time and because i don't know how i just take some warm water and pour mud in. thankfully no one's noticed my inadequacies yet but i'm sure soon enough they will after another person dies of food poisoning and internal infection. 10. how to kill yourself. i don't want the aliens to get anything out of me when i'm taken hostage. i saw it in that tom cruise movie and it was sure scary! so with these things in mind i'm severely disappointed by this book and feel it is mis-marketed and stupid. please barbet schroeder (or whoever the author was) write a better book next time ",negative
" mr. dennett's book demonstrates the ignorance irrationality and dishonesty of humanists. discussing the meaning of word materialsim professor dennett says: in its scientific or philosophical sense it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial--like a cartesian soul or ectoplasm--or god. the standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance matter and ...whatever minds are supposedly made of. (p. 302) philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics. a modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence. the philosophy that god does not exist is not materialism it is naturalism. materialism is the view that all that exists is matter. materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena. (in a quote below you will see that dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in.) it is not clear from the book whether dennett is a materialist but he is certainly a naturalist. concerning the proof of god's existence he trots out david hume's who made god? which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality. i refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof. let's look at two quotes the first is at the end of the chapter belief in belief and the other at the beginning of the chapter morality and religion: that is isn't it true that whether or not god exists religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy in the rule of law in free will? the very widespread (but far from universal) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning. (p. 245) without the divine carrot and stick goes this reasoning people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires beak their promises cheat on their spouses neglect their duties and so on. there are two well-known problems with this reasoning: (1) it doesn't seem to be true which is good news since (2) is is such a demeaning view of human nature. (p. 279) in the first chapter he mentions bulwark of morality and meaning. but in the second chapter he leaves out meaning. if our purpose in life is not to get to heaven what is our purpose is life? whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief. mr. dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist christians. there are worse things than divorcing your spouse. disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said. mr. dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life. the only miracle mentioned in mr. dennett's book is the shroud of turin which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man. since no one claims to know how the image got there it can be called a miracle. however mr. dennett does not tell us anything about it. the reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet.

" this book has major shortcomings; stein's obsession with character over plot for one (martin amis said i used to sneer at plot until i wrote a novel that had one titled night train. it was hard and i used stay awake at night hoping i wasn't leaving any holes.) another being his obsession with show don't tell (gabriel garcia marquez's novel love in the time of cholera is probably the greatest novel of the 1980's and it's almost entirely tell and very little show.) and the passages stein includes from his own novels as examples of good writing were actually examples of terrible writing! (a taxi disengorging its passengers is categorically bad writing.) and stein admits he rejected frederick forythe's the day of the jackal. i wouldn't read a book by dick rowe about how to make it in the music business (rowe famously rejected the beatles from decca records). stein excuses himself that he was going by only an outline but then rowe was going by just a demo tape. better writing books are out there ",negative

" in 1980 michael weiner saw the publication of weiner's herbal: the guide to herb medicine which states the medical benefits of marijuana [7]. however he recently stated that the chemicals in marijuana make it too dangerous to be used as medicine. on his program he strongly cautions against the recreational use of marijuana occasionally devoting his show to marijuana horror stories and its claimed potential to ruin lives. he has authored a number of other books on various herbal medicine topics under this name. more recently savage's books are political in nature and published by wnd books a partnership between the conservative website worldnetdaily and thomas nelson a publisher of christian books. in january 2003 he published the savage nation: saving america from the liberal assault on our borders language and culture his first book under the pseudonym michael savage. the book quickly reached the top of the new york times bestseller list earning savage as noted above a commentary show on msnbc. the controversial book directs attacks at media bias the dominating culture of 'she-ocracy' gays and liberals. critics have faulted savage for making a number of assertions in the book that he often fails to substantiate with facts or resources. exacerbating this condition is the fact that the book itself has no index. the book is divided into two- to four-page sections many of which are near-exact replicas to columns he published on the conservative site newsmax.com. in january 2004 savage published his second political book the enemy within: saving america from the liberal assault on our schools faith and military. his newest book liberalism is a mental disorder was released on april 12 2005. both of these books contained citations of nearly every assertion made contrary to the savage nation. in january 2006 savage announced that he would be releasing a new book the political zoo in mid-march. [8] the book will contain satirical profiles and cartoons of different people in politics as animals in the political zoo including one of savage himself who will be portrayed as the zookeeper. savage has remarked that the book will be easier to digest than his previous political books. books as michael weiner plant a tree new york : collier books 1975 bugs in peanut butter boston : little brown 1976. man's useful plants new york: macmillan. 1976. earth medicine earth food new york : macmillan pub. co. 1980. the way of the skeptical nutritionist new york : macmillan 1981. nutrition against aging bantam books 1983. secrets of fijian medicine quantum books 1983. vital signs avant books 1983 getting off cocaine avon books 1984. maximum immunity boston : houghton mifflin 1986. reducing the risk of alzheimer's new york : stein and day 1987. the complete book of homeopathy garden city park n.y. : avery pub. 1989. the herbal bible san rafael ca : quantum books 1992. healing children naturally san rafael ca : quantum books 1993. herbs that heal : prescription for herbal healing mill valley ca : quantum books 1994. the antioxidant cookbook mill valley ca : quantum books 1995.

[2] some of his letters to ginsberg are held in ginsberg's archives and one of those letters describes an encounter with a young fijian man. [3] savage denies writing the letter and called it part of a smear campaign by gay fascists. [4] savage also once posed naked for a photograph with ginsberg while swimming in fiji. [5] ferlinghetti views weiner's reincarnation as michael savage as total opportunism the crowning achievement of someone who was always looking to make a fast buck and always trying to think up new schemes to get famous. michael savage began his radio career in 1992 on san francisco's #1 news/talk radio station kgo first doing fill in work for other hosts then getting his own show on the weekend. two years later he was given a weekday show on kgo's sister station ksfo where he shared airtime with a liberal talk show host. he chose his nom de voix in the tonga islands in the 1960s. i stumbled upon the name of a [19th-century] shipwreck who was locally infamous -charles savage. his exploits were legendary he said. so the name was bouncing around in my head. at the time his slogan was to the right of rush and to the left of god. on january 1 1995 he was given his own show during the drive-time hours. the show quickly became a local hit. in 1999 he came to the attention of the talk radio network. on january 17 2000 he started doing an additional two hours of radio which was broadcast nationally. for the next eight months savage would spend a total of five hours a day just talking. his national experiment was a success and on september 21 2000 he stopped doing separate shows beginning a full three-hour national show. after just one year he was in 150 markets. by 2003 he was in over 200 markets and is currently the no. 3 radio host in the united states. in june 2003 he had a salary dispute with his flagship station ksfo who refused to renegotiate his contract. he was off the air for three weeks. on july 1 2003 he began his show on a different station: knew in san francisco. since that dispute he speaks badly of ksfo and of vanity or pretty boy sean hannity whose show replaced his on the station. savage also speaks pejoratively when referencing his fellow talk radio hosts or individuals with whom he disagrees (see list of michael savage neologisms). as of 2005 savage has between 8 million and 10 million listeners per week. this makes his show the third most widely listened to broadcast in the united states. in 1996 he applied to be a dean at uc berkeley's graduate school of journalism. when he was not granted an interview due to lack of qualifications--less than two years of experience in radio with a ph.d. in epidemiology and nutrition science--savage filed a discrimination lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. the position instead went to china scholar orville schell who according to weiner was less qualified than himself. savage was hired by msnbc to do a one-hour show starting march 8 2003. on july 7 a mere four months later he was fired for making anti-gay remarks in response to a caller later identified as prank caller east coast bob. savage was doing an airline horror stories piece when bob called into his show to talk about undercover security guards smoking in the bathroom. his next words were half hour into the flight i need to suggest that don and mike should take your show so you can go to the dentist because your teeth are really bad. the words after should were bleeped out by a msnbc exec which would make one believe that the caller was actually making lewd comments about savage's sexual orientation. savage asked if he was a sodomite to which the caller answered yes . savage then said to the caller: oh so you're one of those sodomites. you should only get aids and die you pig how's that? why don't you see if you can sue me you pig. you got nothing better to do than to put me down you piece of garbage you got nothing better to do today go eat a sausage and choke on it. get trichinosis. now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? put another put another sodomite on....no more calls? i don't care about these bums they mean nothing to me. they're all sausages. [6] before the show was canceled msnbc was replaying his show during primetime hours saturday night; many believe the show would have been canceled even without his comments and that msnbc was simply looking for an excuse to dump the program due to pressure from special interest groups. others point out that msnbc has had poor programming and ratings performance for a long time and that many talk shows of all different political stripes have come and gone quickly on the network.

" i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes but i have to admit i'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i've baked from it so far. i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter. i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter. so i was a little skeptical and then reading through the recipes although they are very clearly written there aren't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes. the book already assumes a level of competence. i made three recipes from the book: the essential chewy sugar cookie the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie and the fudgy brownies. all three recipes tasted delicious so i can't complain there but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies. i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results so right now i'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up. i think it's okay for a base cookie recipe book but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients ",negative

" there is no doubt that antonia fraser's the journey is written in the author's usual wry witty and highly engaging style (although i must say that i never before heard of sex described as lugubrious.) there is also no doubt that fraser has done a great deal to redeem marie-antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the french people. the book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. however i was disappointed to see that fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. for one thing why does fraser act like marie antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? what about sophie of anhalt-zerbst (catherine the great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? this sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. i was glad that fraser did not fall into the myth of louis xvi's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. she simplistically portrays him as being asexual which was not true because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed it. but never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of fersen and the queen fiddling with primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. i must say it is a first. fraser insists that marie antoinette slept with fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. i usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character but i guess fraser does. oh well. it is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. i found it absurd when fraser insists that the tormented queen of france was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the french people now enjoy. if the queen had had her way her descendant would be reigning today and that is just the reality of it. for a better study of marie antoinette's relationship with her husband i would recommend vincent cronin's louis and antoinette. as for better biographies of the queen let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of delorme and bertieres will soon be available in english ",negative

" i'll start with the positive: the main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall good-looking smart humble etc. the story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words. in short it was a competent work of fiction. that's where my praise ends because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas. sure it's a work of fiction no one is going to take it seriously yada yada yada. but that's not true is it? so many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers. alright here are my problems with it: first politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state. in term limits vince flynn just beats you over the head with the power corrupts mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song yet from the lips of the marine combat veteran congressman who is our protagonist. you know what though? there are people in politics on both sides of the aisle who really want to do what's right who really are trying to make a difference for the positive for this nation and the citizens. in this book however the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions. second murder is a viable answer. this repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land. come on get real. this book touts a special forces unit as being so committed to the constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget. and they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on. murdering our leaders is the answer according to vince flynn. murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation that being elections. elections apparently just get in the way. third the balanced budget. for years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget. the book makes it the central theme. balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible. it's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel. a coup!!! yet when the conservatives did take power despite vince flynn's prescient forecasting ability they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch. even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility they claim that now!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal that it's really just a function of the percentage of gdp and we ought to all forget about it. this book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later. it's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits. fourth the good guys don't do bad things. the special ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians. the bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool. flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous though shalt not? - cv ric ",negative
" i truly wanted to like this book. after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i'd feared but downright enjoyable. in addition i'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature: captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last. alas it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books i've ever forced myself to finish. this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack. author of two other published novels and a short story collection director of a university level creative writing program long-term teacher of writing and holder of a ph.d. in same all to considerable critical acclaim she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it. so what went wrong? how did this novel end up so awful? the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece. there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things. length: if brevity is the soul of wit this novel's witlessness is easily explained. at 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been. it would seem that to some extent like melville before her naslund confused length with importance but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is. imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody. somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw. the name dropping: one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend. they are badly handled here. an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century new england and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund's peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne. one or two of these developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude. as it is it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor (or the self-awareness). the politics: even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing. however naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling from feminism to free love from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled all without consequence or even criticism. this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves. una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today which is to say: none. the anti-christian bigotry: there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted. it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish the bigoted the future apostate or the mentally ill. it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time except christianity. the farfetched scenarios: i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter.... after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic. after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand) una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle encounters two young men who both fall in love with her disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them successfully avoids detection is sunk by a whale survives by committing cannibalism marries the surviving young man after he goes insane and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians leaving her free to marry captain ahab (una never really marries anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes). things don't get more realistic in the second half which includes una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale. riiiight. the mary sue: however the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a mary sue that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader. a more realistic main character might have saved it. una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything. she doesn't change because she is already perfect. she doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure). the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it. i feel like i've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom... with the door locked.

" i personally do not see how this book could have won a newbery medal. while the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively that is about the only positive aspect of this book. the fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love leaving sara starving for parental care. finally christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. this book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and i would not recommend it to anyone. i wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours.

" alright for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals or lacking in substance i say this: who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are? who is rand to say what substance is? you've got to look at her bias first. realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom. as if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't for her. maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today. but i doubt it. though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live outside influences do affect a person. but she doesn't. thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap. all books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read cause it will lessen your iq. any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand she condemns. rand at least as portrayed in what i've read of her work is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants. and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes. they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality they are either good or worthless. the pieces of art she says are empty are empty absolutely. they don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer. nothing to offer her that is. how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books telling other people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) what they should read? truthfully any criticism in this form like a list i saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others. they have their bias like anyone else. i say read in variety. observe art outside of rand's choice of art. take in all you can with an open mind then start pondering whether you agree or not. if you then agree because you agree then i say great. its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address. she says question society but by my line of inquiry. she says be an individual but only i know the basis of who you want to be ",negative

" what is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book -- which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel -- is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24. nope the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced the great gatsby a mere five years later. this side of paradise is a mess: it is as uneven affected feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero the tiresomely self-conscious young minnesotan-gone-to-princeton amory blaine. (one suspects in fact that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory's diary the result would have been considerably more readable -- or the book's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable at least.) that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 -- it was to prove the most popular book in terms of sales ever produced by its author -- presumably speaks to the public's recognition of something new and revealing in it. okay amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype; and the drinking and shameless smooching (etc.) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably one can accept a revelation to see in print (and likely a titillating one) for an american audience raised on mcguffy's readers -- and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war. welp here it comes: on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon the `petting party.' none of the victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed. to the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is of course very small beer. what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now in the best cases of the paradise narrative as unalarming quaintness. while this is not exactly fitzgerald's fault so to speak it is also true that the use of shocking revelations of this type -- scandals specific to a place and time -- represents a risk a writer takes: the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and/or universal in such episodes. in any event the price the reader pays here in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory's adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties is very very high for payoffs of such modest proportions. i mean come on: for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart. the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it. eleanor was say the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes. yikes. i don't care what new generation you're talking about can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody? (can it represent anything to anybody?) there are things to like even admire here and there in paradise. fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark (e.g. they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered. sometimes i wish i'd been an englishman; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy. it's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes; they do it so much better.) and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator's observations is in its now-curious way refreshingly bracingly funny: slowly and inevitably yet with a sudden surge at the last while amory talked and dreamed [which is about all amory ever does-mht] war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played. every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings. when amory went to washington the next weekend he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-greeks he guessed or russians. nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there's a war on i always say. anyway most of the novel consists of young amory's elaborate ponderings -- romantic philosophical and egotistical -- which are as forgivable as they are forgettable. i've forgotten them already. at some level in any case fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character -- who was of course a not-very-disguised version of himself. for how else if not as commendably self-deprecating irony are we to take this observation? amory was in full stride confident nervous and jubilant. scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours. in the end in any event one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs. fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder. in paradise almost nothing works: form content narrative stance dialogue character development pacing -- you name it it's a problem. yet in gatsby five years later everything works -- everything. if there is to be a great american novel it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor. while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b the fact is that he did -- and without point a the journey could not have begun. so while this side of paradise hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon it surely deserves our respect and indeed our gratitude for what it led to.

" i'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read grapes of wrath or east of eden. instead i have focused on of mice and men and his lesser known works such as to a god unknown and my personal favorite pastures of heaven. i've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular. when i began reading in dubious battle it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck's work. telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac's radical cell. there is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - mac and jim travel by boxcar work secretly through letters go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers. early on the pace is fast exciting and engaging. suddenly steinbeck simply fails to deliver leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again. after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker's strike i expected the sense of excitement to continue. it simply never does. summary of in dubious battle - workers get mad. workers get tired. workers get mad. workers get tired. workers get mad. workers get tired. the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking. and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book. most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense... ...and eating. steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding eating and (worst of all) talking about food. there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment discussing whatever comes to mind. steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters. but i advise any reader of in dubious battle to take this course - after the strike is initiated simply set the book down. you won't miss anything. nothing of great import happens and only a very few memorable characters ever surface and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces. i suppose now i'll give grapes of wrath a go. perhaps if it isn't one of his greats it isn't worth reading ",negative

" while talk to the hand is inescapably mediocre in comparison to eats shoots & leaves a book i found amusing though not up-to-par to its new york times bestseller status this book does have its moments. however i was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of lynne truss in presuming to make a comment that despite whatever way she meant it ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice. i find it interesting that she or at least her editors did not further investigate the disease (which indeed gluten tolerance is) before publishing such a degrading remark. oh yes bloody well sorry ms. truss for invading your rude stay-home-and-bolt-the-door causitive world with yet another irritation which i'm sure someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet. let's just go and well obliterate a genetic disorder! while we're at it we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk. if it pleases and thanks you ms. truss we celiacs will eat cake. (oh bloody hell did i just say please?) despite the fact that lynne truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place i have to wonder if she's experiencing the effects of projection. in explaining how rude we humans are it was necessary for her to be quite rude as well. it is not simply the celiac remark to which i refer: i also found her supermarket incident in which a kid shouts at his mother i want that one you effing bitch! among others a bit offensive. as a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness i was often thoroughly appalled by this book. no my friends and i don't usually hold doors for each other but in general i thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown. frankly i find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends as well as strangers than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others. i can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation or if they must answer they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them. i have to argue that we are not a select group. in today's world one sees what one expects to see; one is treated as one expects to be treated. ms. truss i believe would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could she would be surprised to find that when people are rude she cares less because she knows that she at least is doing her best not to be. if she did this maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior. my last complaint is this: gluten crap? you would think that such a sophisticated eloquent (as she is dedicated to proving) person as lynne truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year am-i-not-so-cool-and-bitchin' (?) style word crap.

" reading through john irving's the cider house rules i found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. in obtaining a bachelor's degree in english i had to read a lot of books. among them were many books that i did not like but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety. every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. people become pregnant have abortions and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. the book doesn't flow naturally you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows playing the puppet master. there are just so many coincidences so many old friends just happening to run into eachother so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly all of the characters vaguely distantly connected to eachother. i don't want to spoil the plot but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. it's as though the author is god and the characters completely lack free will. and then there's the protagonist homer wells. i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story homer wells barely does anything in the story. he barely even speaks during the story. he is virtually a non-character devoid of personality or will around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all and they make up the majority of the book are without fail the most interesting scenes. i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr. larch but even melony seems more real than homer does. the story is very long and rambling. subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. minor characters keep popping into the story then disappearing only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with debra pettigrew). after such a rambling at times rather boring plot the ending feels rather rushed. it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything tie up every loose end in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends in this case means a lot of people conveniently dying). to spoil the plot just a little homer wells who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. i personally am pro-choice as well but i found that homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters ",negative
" i'm a wiccan who formally practices within a traditional gardnerian coven but practices eclectically within my private practice. i read this book because i had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a christian; purportedly wicca's charm was written by an impartial writer. immediately you realize that this isn't true. catherine sanders has a clearly stated agenda: that wiccans are simply misguided and misunderstand that what they long for is offered by christianity. i could write a long review debating the merits of sanders' arguments. instead i suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which sanders claims to have thoroughly researched. she relies on the writings of margot adler carol christ starhawk and phyllis curott (with barely a nod to scott cunningham and ronald hutton) to draw many of her conclusions. yet missing from her notes are such writers as the farrars merlin stone raymond buckland isaac bonewits patricia crowley and the matthews to name just a few outstanding contributors to neopaganism's base of knowledge. too often sanders relies on the statements of young wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive. in another case she bases her thesis that women's spirituality (e.g. goddess worship)is misguided and that christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via one speech that she heard margot adler give shortly after 9/11. sanders requests both christians and neopagans to read her book with an open mind. a fair request. but as you're reading closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind or whether sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that christianity has everything that a wiccan desires. one needs to go no further than to consider that as sanders attempts to persuade the reader that christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of paul.

" this book is a small bundle of common knowledge wrapped up in an insulting amount of hyperbole and hucksterism (and very bad english). just how many times can you claim a technique will improve your workouts by a factor of ten or is the most valuable breakthrough in history before you lose all credibility? in the first 30 pages winnowing out the fluff i read this: 1) fad diets bulimia and steroids are bad for you. 2) gaining muscle and losing fat are biologically distinct processes so they require two classes of exercises. 3) it's good to concentrate your attention on the particular muscles you are using during weight-training routine. 4) creative visualization and self-hypnosis can help you reach your goals. (ok i'm a bit skeptical about this one.) in other words this book has taught me nothing of value that i didn't already know. looking ahead in the index i can see much more of the same. i'm afraid i've been had. i bought this book on the strength of amazon reader recommendations. please don't make the same mistake. look to gain muscle lift weights every other day and eat lots of protein; to lose fat do cardio on off days and watch your total calories. if you're already doing those things don't bother with this book. i was looking for more specific tips but i didn't find them here and neither will you ",negative

" the author is reusing a similar plot device than in twisted: a somewhat obscure reference material that shows up late in the book and clarifies everything. that is a poor strategy for a mystery novel because the reader expects to be given clues so as to be involved in the logical process of solving the crimes. the narrative in general is not kellerman at his best either. the characterizations are so shallow that one wonders all the time why the characters act like they do. a small part of the book talks about brazil and kellerman simply invents a couple of portuguese words making them sound spanish: (favilla favillitos). one wonders how much of the author's research is similarly fictional. in sum a book carelessly executed ",negative
" the author of this book warren wagar is apparently a professor of future studies. i certainly hope he has long been fired from that post. a short history of the future was written in 1989 but the writer is so ignorant of politics and so wrong to be blunt it reads as if it was written in the 1940's. orwell's 1984 is more on the mark than this. he shows barely any creativity in his predictions and clearly was barely even aware of much of the contemporary political developments of his time. the fact that he assumes the soviet union will continue plodding along well into the 21st century is incredibly naive. the fact that he assumes the nation's socialist economy system would survive equally long is similarly bizarre. did he read the newspapers? did he pay any attention to that gorbachev fellow and the path he was bringing russia down? and honestly did anyone really expect that germany would remain divided into two states until time immortal? or that latin america and africa would remain dictatorships forever? or that black rule in south africa would not occur until 2014? if this book had been written 30 or 40 ago it would be excusable. this book is just sloppy. he doesn't even do a good job describing how his corporations take over the world. everything is just described in these overly flowery sweeping generalizations. like and then the capital lords seized control of the governments and made the state wither like an autumn rose. that sort of thing. the author is clearly an ivory tower academic who believes history can be predicted sorely through dry marxist theory and analyzing dubious vague trends. the fact that this book became horribly dated something like three years after it was published is quite a strong indictment of a man whose entire job was devoted to predicting the future.

" this book is poorly written and even more poorly edited. the back cover states ... every subject is given background and basic exercises to allow beginners to figure it out. it is a great statement but it is unfortunately not true. page 6: so what formats can a script be saved as? there are three main kinds of script files: regular compiled script which is the native applescript file format and scripts saved as plain text or as applications. on top of that os x added a new option for saving compiled scripts and script applications called bundle. bundles are folders that appear and behave as files. you can read about them in chapter 23. - i guess bundle is not a main format? why is there a distinction between main formats and for lack of a better term minor formats? i have no idea. page 35: every class has a super class. page 40: we saw that objects belong to classes and classes may have subclasses and super classes. - which sentence is correct? page 43: when you work with an application that doesn't support the whose clause you have to settle for slower clumsier repeat loops. - repeat loops are not explained earlier in the book. there is no reference on this page to the repeat loops that are explained extensively in chapter 11 pages 321-343. i wanted to like this book but i do not. i look forward to a revised first edition or new second edition of this book because it does have potential to be great. however the next edition needs more polished writing and meticulous editing ",negative

" i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others hoping to learn about america's prison system. i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic. unfortunately in the first twenty pages of the book elsner claims that america imprisons 704 people per every 10000 citizens. if you do the math that equals 7% of our population. 7% of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york. according to this author there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york. before you get too worried let me reassure you that this is not the case. america imprisons 736 people per *100000* citizens (as of 5/06) or .736% of the population. this is the highest rate in the entire world so there's no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic. for comparison stalin had .771% of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges. again there's really no need to exaggerate america's rate of incarceration. what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page but is repeated several times. apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7% of our population and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover. personally i can't take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out on the first twenty pages no less. if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10 how do we know the rest of the book isn't off by a power of 10? elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine. don't buy this book ",negative

" i'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and i can't decide among the following: * travels through guilt with the world's 33rd richest hippie * the mind of an empty suit * a self-important revisionist history * how i learned to hate myself and love the third world * memoirs of a cold war paperpusher confessions of an economic hitman by john perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the cold war by a man who had no stake in his own ambition. the first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry. if you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy then the moral outrage of this book makes sense. but there's a whole lot to swallow. on the plus side it's a fast and somewhat entertaining read. otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface. one of the things that i've had in mind as i was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny. as i look at the 20th century i think of most of it focused on the economics of . perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation. he falls in love with socialist charismatics in latin america rues the lives of poor peasants and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism. perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist. a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric. but you can't imagine that he even had the temerity to read marx weber engles friere or anyone. back when i was a bit more blackified i referred to such people as culture vultures. if it's indigenous it's good. but you'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics literacy rates crime rates or even inflation. i discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the world bank except that he saw it as evil. technically you'll get a great deal more insight reading wikipedia. basically perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the cia and nsa and that this is was and always will be the american way. you really get a foggy view of the evil empire of america from perkins who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game. it's a confession all right. by the time i got 2/3rds of the way through reading the book began to become annoying. the incredible vacuity of this man was staggering. there are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of. he found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning. it is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory. we learn that he took one of his charges (female) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the caribbean but that when he got there he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees. if you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance the best book i've read is my life as a quant. if you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy the best book to read is larry kolb's overworld. if you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the cold war era then this is your book. but it's nowhere near as good as say the quiet american. you can imagine that perkins who is a great admirer of graham greene might have had aspirations to be such a character as greene might pen. he is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus but he is to honest to consider himself heroic and i suspect that he'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life. in that regard 'confessions of an economic hitman' is (now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition) a blueprint for american liberal guilt. if there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom america to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown it is john perkins. he has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic american down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of thomas paine. you'd think being a pseudo-economist that he'd have some room in his heart for alexander hamilton. ahh but that would mean that he'd have to admire courage. i didn't want to be a harsh judge of perkins. i thought i might learn of an extraordinary life one of conviction and then epiphany. instead i learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through. someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that 'corporatocray' is evil. this book has been a disappointment in many ways. i may well be very happy to read thomas friedman after this. good parts? yeah there are a few. he speaks about a few south american presidents who might have been contenders. he gives a few details about saudi aramco. but compared to larry kolb's fascinating and detailed portraits of daniel ortega and adnan khashoggi this is romper room. if perkins thought he was an agent... don't make me laugh ",negative

" ok i know i'm going to get hammered for this; once again there goes my reviewer rating. but i just have to be honest: this is a terrible story. ok being that it's shakespeare it's prettily told but it's still a horrible story and i can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. perhaps they feel that shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it is a comedy after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable if i could believe it. but given that it is a shakespearean comedy we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a happy one and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. or perhaps people believe (i've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that kate has actually triumphed at the end having figured out how to manipulate petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. even if this were true i'd hardly consider it a happy anding and personally i see little evidence of it. no what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there is a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who tames her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her simply starves her and sleep-deprives her as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. her spirit may or may not be broken depending on how the part is played but the fact remains that she's forced to behave as if it is and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a comedy. this is absolutely the worst of shakespeare's plays ",negative
" i am in the planning stages of a new business venture. i have never written a marketing plan before and needed some insight and advice as to what tactics work and how to write the plan itself. this book reads like a list of useful one-liner marketing tips and examples of how the author's friends have used them. it is not a how to book on writing a marketing plan and it does not go into much depth as far as how you might accomplish the things that he recommends. the most annoying part of this book is that every other page contains an advertisement for you to join some 12-week commitment mailing list that the author has created. he entices you by saying that you will receive additional tips and information for 12 weeks. hello!!! mcfly!!! didn't i just buy your book so that i could learn your marketing insights? yes! so then why do you make it seem like i just paid for the teaser information and that the good stuff is behind the curtain that requires me to become a pawn in your marketing career? my price of admission stops at the price of this book and it should not seem like i'm only getting half of the story that i paid for!

" a subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball &quot;nuts&quot; who grew up in new york. we idolized the terribly tarnished ccny &quot;wonder five&quot; who set an unbreakable record by winning both the nit and ncaa titles in 1950 (it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled). this book is a fictional addendum to rosen's non-fiction treatment of the original basketball &quot;scandals&quot; as he outlines in his npr interview. unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors -- broadway and 43rd street cannot be on the east side of manhattan; madison square garden has been on 23rd street and is now above penn station; in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th streets and eighth and ninth avenues. these errors are particularly galling in a book by a new yorker who played at hunter college and they undermine the author's credibility and care in writing. since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence the game of who is this really is inescapable. hence it is most unfortunate that rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers and &quot;a couple are in the hall of fame.&quot; this tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as bob cousy (holy cross '49) dick mcguire (st. johns '48) bobby wanzer (seton hall '46) and frank mcguire the legendary coach at st. john's north carolina and south carolina ",negative
" first of all ike is doing the very thing that tina always said he would do. ike turner will never admit to what he did to tina. tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like all the others. ike took advantage of her. tina her self said she cared very much for him. cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him. even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happened. tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on. so she released her autobiography in 1986 well after her come-back in 1984. while ike can try to deny it all he wants the truth is he violently abused tina! and considering the person ike turner is i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back!!

" i received my ph.d. in theoretical and applied mechanics from one of the best u.s. universities and for more than thirty years was teaching and researching in the field of solid mechanics. before starting the reading of this book i was in the agreeable mood with the author's that machines can never be human and that ai will retain (if not forever) for a very long time its name - unreal. but now i am dismayed. the author unsuccessfully used 450 pages full of topics in mathematics and physics to support his point of view making simple topics sound difficult and making diffcult ones look impossibble. the inclusion of his strange tilings is strange. all in all the book does not make sense. moreover his 'note to the reader' (which is patronizing arrogant and deceiving) and his prologue and epilogue (which are at best cynical) should have warned me not to venture any further. i cannot help feeling sorry for myself and for several other readers; and most of all if this is the author's usual way of communicating his ideas for his students. luckily i did not buy this book; for one person who could not stand reading through it dared me to finish his unfinished endeavor ",negative

" well the fact that i'm writing a review about this book while it's sitting open on my desk next to my computer open and not being read might be some evidence of how i'm enjoying this book. this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn't be so difficult. this book is not clear or easy to understand at all. every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page (!) making this work look like a research project for a phd publication. i have the casebook in this series and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity. and it turns to be true! this book might be good if you're advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail or as an advanced reference later on to look something up like in an encyclopedia. some concepts which should be pretty clear just get too in-depth coverage in this book. it's too complex for a first-year student. sometimes it starts describing the different views out there and then there's a jumble in your head as to what the law really is. i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors.

" this book is terribly organized. i'm not sure what happened in writing this book but it seems clear that professor jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in. my main complaint is that rather obscure concepts/people/events are repeatedly referred to and then only later does jones bother to define them. (i would almost prefer that he not define something at all rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it!) the fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me - clearly the author/publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate/first reference to the concept. examples are numerous but here are a few: **robe nobility: referenced on pages 139 152 183. defined? (pg. 183) **sans culottes: first referenced on page 189 defined on page 231. **louis-sebastien mercier: referenced on pages 11 138 178 189 200 204 212 213. when did jones provide information (that he was a journalist dramatist and observer of parisian mores) on just who mercier is? page 215. aside from that there are some plain old errors. one such is in the text box on saint genevieve. jones mentions that she negotiated with frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s. she died in 512ad so the negotiations seem improbable. (470s & 480s would be correct but i should not have to figure that out.) the redeeming quality of the book is that if does offer information on paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances. and paris is not such a bad subject ",negative
" this is my first ludlum book and it is sure to be my last. the plot is preposterous because of ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history. once you realize that all interest in the story falls away. it starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some weapon more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars! hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania. some spoiled rich american brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history. i know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction and it is all in good fun but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest. if you don't need logic in your fiction it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department ",negative

" firstly let me say the research nicholas lardy has conducted is commendable and a welcome addition to the existing literature. his data sources are vast and highly informative. the major limitation of this publication is that the central argument is biased. lardy selects those data and pieces of existing literature which support his own view. as a result major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over. lardy's view is the typical western dare i say &quot;american&quot; argument. primarily he uses financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of china's state banks. this methodoloy is extremely poor - particularly in the context of china's trannsitional economy. financial criteria are a horrible guide to both internal and allocative economic efficiency. if anyone would like elaboration on this point feel free to email me. in summary lardy's book is informative and makes for interesting reading. however as a piece of economic analysis its usefulness is limited. the major reason for this is a total lack of economic theory(as indicated by the previous reviewer) which has resulted in a poor methodology ",negative

" i was eager to read this book but after reading it i was left completely flat. the rest of the iceberg? hardly. smith barely gives us more than what we could get from reading sports illustrated or any minnesota sports page. he admits he's not a fan of football but for the majority of the book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football career. this book is touted as: his full and complete story. so we learned he was watching ren & stimpy during his nfl draft. wow are these the types of meaty stories that we want to read? how about telling us more of the inside details... how did smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or girlfriends only because he was a star football player? who were his friends that he could trust and when did he need that trust? what thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent? what was he doing when he was goofing off and missing class all summer which led to one of the most covered stories of his time at ohio state? when and why did he begin using pot? if football is not smart enough for him why doesn't he study and break down some of the coaching process that is more mentally challenging? what happened to plans for medical school? we know the stories of football; those are the parts of the iceberg that have already been documented. i also felt smith wrote this book as if he is defending himself from all of america. who is attacking him? why does he feel the need to explain why he was paid so much? highly paid athlete stories are sorry for the pun a dime a dozen. he tries to compare his sitting out for more money to a scenario for the average guy. the truth is many people will take a job for 5% less than a co-worker because yes they value things other than money and yes they are happy to have a job. leaving the grammatical errors to the other reviewers it felt like i was reading an average high school creative writing project. 'i did this i did that i went to bed next day.' half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep philosophy: pop music. smith notes less than 50 percent of americans read at a 10th-grade level. well this book certainly won't tax the reading ability of too many people. one lesson from this book is that smith had opportunities to swallow his pride take some coaching and come up with a better solution. this book is another one of those times. he should have hired an editor or writing consultant who could give guidance. build the characters; help us feel their stories. instead smith felt it necessary to go alone to get to the raw emotions. sorry but compared to other autobiographies this was not an emotional book. i'm sure smith is all the things that mike gutter says he is such as: thoughtful honest trustworthy dependable passionate... but i felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these characteristics were left out of this book. instead we are still looking for the rest of the iceberg.

" this is the latest in a never-ending series of books trying to generalize non-business world (eg. sports armed forces girl scouts religion nasa etc.) management techniques to the business world. most possibly all are of little value because of major differences. 1)members constituting the varying organizations are motivated differently and face greatly significantly different situations. what does eg. a fighter pilot or football coach have in common with a pharmicist nurse professor financial analyst etc.? i have no idea. 2)key success factors vary from one business to another. for merck it may be speed of developing new drugs getting through fda approval and motivating physicians to use them. for nucor steel it undoubtedly rests much more on low-cost production. again what does either have to do with fighter pilots - little if anything. one is better off reading books from similar situations - eg. about wal-mart (if you are in retailing) about allied-signal or g.e.

" this book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every american president. each individual section includes a brief summary of the president's successes and failures while in office. the secrets lives aspect includes a description of his temperament character and personal habits. for example john adams is said to have been vain and irritable while frankin pierce is depicted as an alcoholic. also much oddball trivia is mentioned such as that george washington had dentures made of hippo bone rather wood. the biographical information is at least somewhat educational especially on the lesser known presidents such as millard fillmore and zachary taylor. but most people who study history will already known much of what is written here. the truth is that o'brien is not an actual presidential historian with scholarly credentials. but rather a freelance writer who apparently just read a few books such as the reader's companion to the american presidency and then gathered together the bits he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining. also o'brien provides no original research and some of what he reports as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars. however what i found most disturbing about this book is o'brien's tone and attitude. his so-called humorous style is basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed against the various presidents especially those he dislikes. for example he jokingly suggests that andrew jackson had some unknown frontal lobe damage. i have no problem challenging the policy decisions of a particular president. in fact i disagree with much of jackson's presidential agenda especially his bigoted policies directed against american indians. however i also think it is possible to have political disagreements without resorting to the sort of cheapshots that o' brien uses. overall i found the book to be juvenile mean-spirited and overly negative. there are many better researched and well written books on presidential history out there. so don't waste your time on this one.

" if you like unimaginative phony crap you'll love this book. the proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable. an antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers? a diurnal and terrestrial mammal that for some god-forsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind? primates that don't evolve to fit man's niche but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels? the thing has got nonsense written all over it. the future animals proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody please find mr. dixon a liguist and fast! some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature's plausibility. a vortex? a posset? what jerk scientist of the future is naming these things? can he please be institutionalized? i admit the pictures were well done and pre-teen children would probably enjoy this immensely. i know i would've when i was 10 or 11 and there's nothing wrong with that it's just that dougal dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids chains of evolution and ecological niches but then converts to unscientific baloney around page 30. all in all i just don't think it's cut out for people over the age of 12 or so unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures. but in that case why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution? why not pick up a copy of the dungeons and dragons monster manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures? i find that books intended to showcase the fantastic do much better outside the realm of (somewhat-boring) science ",negative
" typical feinstein (a season on the brink excepted). quick gossipy superficial fawning etc. etc. this book is about the 2002 u.s. open golf championship at the bethpage black golf course a new york state park course on long island. the subtitle inside the ropes at bethpage black is used here as a figure of speech meaning behind the scenes. (inside the ropes is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers caddies officials and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.) feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion. we see u.s golf association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g. 4850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and u.s.g.a. can have a huge payday) about random qualifiers and random competitors and about the resurrection of the black golf course. yet the book does not fulfill its promise. my guess is that feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis i had hoped for ",negative

" i admit that i tried to read this twice and failed both times. i got to around page 20 or so. i'll probably try again. however if you're an adult who has already read other philosophies i would suggest attempting to read it just so you'll know what objectivism is about. i wouldn't suggest it for teens that haven't had any prior readings though. objectivism is about the self and about reason and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else. the strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous. i assume that's in my head but judge for yourself. her caricatures of the witch doctor (who controls others from a spiritual perspective) and attila (who controls by brute force) are actually interesting. wrong but interesting. since objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival (or think they do anyway) it's rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book. my suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand (she's not wrong on everything) or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills. judging by previous reviews it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers. if you buy into it you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo-intellectual way. if you don't buy into it however you're evil (either the witch doctor or attila) and probably just too stupid to get it. why i didn't finish it yet... i just couldn't get past her ignorance of history frankly. if you're writing a work of fiction the historical innacuracies don't matter but this isn't supposed to be fiction. i like history and most people don't so it probably won't bother most people. also while she denounces religion ms. rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself. like all other religions and cults the world is messed up basically because people don't think like she does.

" the novel a northern light by jennifer donnelly is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a teenage farm girl bound for a great future. jennifer donnelly relates to mattie gokey the lead character in a way that they bother grew up in rural side of new york. donnelly attended the university of rochester before she wrote her three novels and one children's book. her novels include the tea rose the winter rose a northern light and a children's book humble pie. all of her novels include a very popular romantic theme and her book a northern light has also been introduced in europe under the title a gathering light. a northern light reflects a lot on the issues of wealth education love and murder. the combination of those themes makes for a novel that anyone is able to read and relate to. as you read this book you feel like the main message is the traditional clich of following your dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve. but as you read further you realize that it's a lot about hardships strength and love. on the first page of the book mattie is imagining a perfect day at the glenmore hotel before she so disappointingly tells herself i believe these things. with all my heart. for i am good at telling myself lies. from this quote you can see the type of person mattie is and it gives a foreshadowing to the events that would take place throughout the novel. the events typically consist of let down after let down for mattie and her hopes for her future. this book is written from mattie's point of view which really helps the reader to get to know her better. it adds a different element to the book that wouldn't be there if it wasn't written from mattie's point of view. it lets you get inside mattie's head and feel the emotions that she's dealing with along with her true thoughts and feeling towards situations. mattie is truly troubled girl who works so hard toward what she wants and yet there is always something holding her back. she's stuck in a farming town where education isn't as important as having a prosperous farm and a family. as you read this book you just want to tell mattie that she needs to take her own future into consideration and stop worrying long enough to have some faith. she is a selfless giver who is willing to do anything and everything to keep her family and her farm doing well. she deals with extreme guilt for wanting to leave her father after her mother died. she has to learn that the promise that she made to her mother to always take care of her family includes taking care of herself as well. royal loomis enters mattie's life at a very unconventional time when mattie's unsure of what she wants to become and she has to chose between his love and the life she's always wanted. mattie deals with her teacher miss wilcox leaving town. miss wilcox was mattie's role model who was living the life of an independent poet with a car and a royal lifestyle. the life mattie wants. this book is intended for a female audience because it deals with issues that sometime only a girl could understand. it's a fairly easy read so it is more for adolescents than adults but not for young children. the issues that it deals with are issues that children may not be able to appreciate as much as teenagers who are about to go to college and leave their families. a northern light is full of valuable lessons but most of all it's just a good book to get lost in.

" as i sat here writting this review my rating dropped from a three star rating to a two star rating and i now realize that all of my malice and discontent could have easily been diverted if the book were titled drawing people: a technical guide for beginners and mentioned nary a word about the clothed figure. then if i had of stumbled upon this book it would have been an added bonus that the author took the time to outline some basics on clothing and drappery instead of a full out disappointment. not that i blame the author solely most of the blame lies at my door. i was so overjoyed in finding a book that proclaimed it was specifically about drawing the clothed figure brune hogath's book aside (another devastating disappointment) and that it was written by a professor from the academy of art a school that i am still deciding on attending that instead of going my normal route (ordering the book through the store checking it out in person and then ordering it online so i could get a fatty discount) i impulsively bought the book only reading the book synopsis and barely glancing over the customer reviews (which all looked favorable). now i realise my folly and am yet determining whether i'll pay for it (i.e. keep the book). i guess what all of my harping boils down to is the lack of content instead of the quality for i can easily discern bradley is an excellent artist with years of knowledge garnered from experience and i'd say that experience shows equally in all areas not just clothing but in setting up a composition and following through. the problem is at least in my opinion that this book is supposed to specifically address clothing and it doesn't for the most part. roughly one fourth of the book pertains to clothing the other three fourths talk about: how to properly hold your drawing implement how to properly position yourself if you are drawing from a live modle maintaing a daily sketchbook researching your subject matter the relationships between the head neck and shoulders drawing hands drawing feet drawing eyes and a whole slew of other. . .i wouldn't say irrelavent because they are relavent but not neccessarily the most important topics pertaining to drawing the clothed figure. a refernce guide on clothing should discuss a plethora of clothing materials and bradley does on one page with chicken scratch detailing. it should outline some of the rules when dealing with how clothes tend to fit people of varying body tips again something bradley discusses on one single page. the differnce between water logged clothing and dry clothing she didn't bother mentioning that. how pants typically bunch up while you're walking seen from the head on profile three quaters and back view another topic she failed to mention. some examples of evening/ formal attire vs. day clothes how clothing reacts when the subject is in motion how jackets restrain your actions and bunch up the effect of wearing multiple layers at once achieving that perfect windswept look and all manner of other topics that should appear in an artistic clothing refernce guide. maybe i'm being too harsh on bradley after all she does mention in her preface that there aren't a whole lot of books pertain to drawing the clothed figure and compared to the standard how to. . . books she's leaps and bounds ahead of the rest. oh yeah that's another thing she doesn't outline any steps on how to achieve a realistic rendering like- first start out with a cone pointing upward then draw a sphere at the bottom/base. the sphere represents the weight of the gathered cloth so the stress lines originate from the tip of the cone and travel down the length eventually enveloping the sphere. note the ripples. -or some junk like that. back to me not being to harsh on bradley i guess in reading she is/was a professor in the arts i thought she would have some understanding of the common impediments modern day artist face when depicting clothing. for all who have read this drawn out rant two maybe three people and think i'm all talk trust me if i had the skills i'd come up with my own series of how to draw. . . books and address all of my issues. as is i'm pretty good at drawing dynamic figures but the second i add clothing they become flat lifeless caricatures and i don't see this book as alleviating my shortcomings much. as is my own artistic habits (drawing from magazines online pics and occasionally stepping outside of my cave to draw people in motion) are a match for the few helpful hints in this book. you're better off doing what you've always done plus artistically drapping to a wall or over a piece of furniture from time to time then buying this book. if you do know of a book that addresses even half of the afore mentioned topics if you could write a review mentioning them somehow recommend them to me or whatever i'd be eternally in your debt ",negative

" i thoroughly enjoyed the author's earlier work on how the irish saved civilization. but this book was a disappointing compendium of greek myths legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book. taken in its subparts many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose. yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight. where's the big picture? the author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the greeks' variety of human response lightening quick transmutations resourcefulness and inexhaustible creativity. a subtitle like a greek treasury of personal vignettes might have been more descriptive and merited another star. but it falls short as a hinge of history with impoverished and even maladaptive connections (fdr as solon - really?) to the modern world. i am sorry to not recommend it.

" there is one thing that every cookbook author can learn from how to cook without a book: recipes and techniques every cook should know by heart by pam anderson (not the big-breasted one) and that is the art of the highly marketable title. for starters this artful moniker really plays on the single gal's fears about never being able to put together nutritious attractive varied affordable and delicious meals for her future family every single night of the week. you want your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates when you send them off into the big bad world. so the plus side of this book is the title. that's where it ends. the big idea here is to help the reader become a non-cookbook-consulting cook by: a) teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to variation and b) suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking techniques. sounds interesting so far right? well the problem is that almost all the recipes rely on canned low-sodium chicken broth which i think is a bit of a weird ingredient. it's even included in the salad dressings. other big hitters include: heavy cream butter and sour cream. do people really eat like this? regularly? why not make the easy fruit parfaits for a quick and sweet ending to your meal? just take a tall glass drop in a few spoonfuls of sour cream then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar and some berries. repeat until the glass is filled. crikey. sour cream brown sugar and berries?!? wouldn't it be just as easy to put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of greek honey? am i totally off base thinking that this sounds much more appetizing? or if calories are no object anyway why not pick up some baskin robbins' rocky road on the way home from work? that's easy and it's worth the internal havoc it will cause. oh and here's a sample mnemonic device that i can't not share it's that good: cook tender vegetables with garlic and oil then toss in some pasta that's fresh from the boil. pure genius right? right. in a way the author was right - i can cook all these things without a book. but why would i want to ",negative

" dr. hawkins first book power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology. however he began to venture into misapplication of this method and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity concept or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement. there are serious logical philosophical and practical flaws in his work and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests. this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques. the actual technique is worthwhile but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid. the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate valid answers. hawkins explores issues about media politics religion spirituality history philosophies healing arts entertainment and more and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters. he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters liars and two-faced sociopaths. he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don't resort to hawkins' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth. hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod. i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful responsible work in those areas. for now i'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world ",negative

" i haven't done this in awhile but i don't think i could review this piece any better than the other reviews i've read about it. it's pretty average however filled with nice bits of knowledge. they didn't seem well-researched in some areas. here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other critics that i agree with... they go into lengthy history lessons about the origins of the characters when two sentences...would be enough. - john gallant biased against superheros(sic) - christopher ritter i found this book to be tedious lacking in charm badly researched and wildy inaccurate in some areas. - c.p. halliday i picked up this book. - lawrance m. bernabo their belief seems to be that donald duck was the best comic book ever... - m.g. bloedorn pretty boring. - bernardz ...a black hole is hypothesized lending a faint respectability to the premise behind green lantern's abilities. - peter vinton jr. ...this book will not satisfy full on fans... - james n. simpson &lt;---gave it five stars. a chance to laugh about the heroes i still love and that mean so much to me. - reviewer man there's a whole 200 pages of this pooh-poohing cranky-old-maid kind of stuff! - mark alfred they were even putting words into c. darwin's mouth. - aaron spriggs mildly entertaining but not great - reviewer when the man (dean koontz in this case) writing the introduction says he doesn't read comics i began to get worried. - ivan a. wolfe i agree with an earlier poster. - reviewer almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible. plastic larry the authors give us a more plausible (given what we know now) origin for the hulk involving steroids and fluorescent gene modification. - j. draper carlson this book is not mean spirited or nasty. reviewer superman's powers break the laws of science. ooh. stop the presses. - [...] interesting. - rick hunter the science of superheroes - reviewer ",negative

" i am ashamed to say i read this entire book. i kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. it is filled with typos and poor organization of thoughts and topics. clarkson actually spells mel gibson's name wrong several times throughout the book and refers to lethal weapon director richard donner as dormer for several pages! he jumps back and forth from one movie production to another making it difficult to follow. lastly he relies on the accounts of people who had met mel gibson at one time but who had either a personal or professional conflict with him. in the retelling of these conflicts and what went down we hear one point of view only - and generally that is the view of someone who is harboring bitterness and resentment towards gibson so their accounts are slanted and untrustworthy. the best part of the book is the end for two reasons: clarkson finally gets to gibson's most recent project the passion of the christ. the subtitle and the picture on the back of the book gives the impression this project will be a major focus of the book but after 300 pages of reading i was still waiting for the subject to come up. i have to say i felt that this was the only well written part of the whole book - thoughtful and interesting. the second reason the end is the best part of the book is that it was finally over. i'm sorry to be so blunt but i can't help it. i highly recommend reading the book about the making of the passion of the christ - you can learn a lot about gibson there - but i cannot recommend this biography ",negative

" i am sorry to say that i thoroughly disliked of human bondage. i know it is on every must read list for fiction (which is why i decided to read it) however i just wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to such a hallowed position in literature? not only did i find it dull but i was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main character's perception of women! i'm not a feminist in the least but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic ways. yellow teethed sallow skin dirty hands tear stained over powdered face it goes on and on. i wondered if the author was uncomfortable women? i looked online for some information about maugham. to my surprise i found out that maugham was bisexual. he did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men. in no way can i say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book -- but in some way it answered my question or concern. instead of this book i'd recommend the following classics: beautiful and damned by f. scott fitzgerald madame bovary by flaubert. at least in these books maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but the characters are written with such sensuality that even though they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that makes them multidimensional -- good or bad.

" this is the worst book of shakespeare criticism i have ever read. bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next. it reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly handed to a graduate student and entered into a computer over a weekend. he contradicts himself several times. i donated my copy to the library as soon as i was done reading it so i cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur; but several times i recall reading a passage where bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier. to make matters worse he even says the bard contradicts himself. he points to supposed paradoxes regarding hamlet's age stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30. apparently the point is that if shakespeare contradicts himself so can bloom. bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that hamlet is a slacker. he has not grown up yet. that is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom. some of the book's observations are interesting but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from bloom's notes. interespersed between the passages scribbled down from bloom's lectures are outbursts where bloom reminds us that shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer in verse or prose who ever lived. bloom is a great critic when he still tries but in this book he was not even trying ",negative

" this is a decent book on photographing artwork -- but not the the most comprehensive. the strengths of this book are that mr. saddington (1) discusses the use digital media and (2) makes the process of photographing artwork very user-friendly by providing great visual references throughout. the user-friendly aspect is the book's strongest selling point especially for artists who are new or novices at photography or visually oriented (i.e. no patience for reading instructions that come with few or no pictures). mr. saddington's book provides pictures of what makes a bad negative exposure/photograph and provides a concise explanation for these results and does the same for an example of a good negative exposure/photograph. he also provides illustrations of setting up equipment and artwork for photographing. the weakness of this book lies in the general details provided ... unfortunately mr. saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves out specific details for for problem shooting ... i base this opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called &quot;photographing your artwork&quot; by russell hart. if you buy mr. saddington's book i'd recommend supplementing it with the purchase of mr. hart's book. the two books complement each other. where mr. saddington's book lacks in details mr. hart's book fills in the information gaps. on the other hand mr. hart's book is very text heavy and has very few illustrations ... so if you're a visually-oriented person mr. saddington's book would easily compensate in the area of illustrating this very important process. again mr. saddington's book is decent but it should be used as a supplemental reference especially for the visually-oriented person ",negative
" first off: i'd like it better if we had 1/2-star options. judas unchained really doesn't deserve a 2 more a 2-1/2 or 2-3/4. i have a love/hate relationship with peter hamilton's books. he's very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but as with a lot of these hard-science libertarian sf authors he badly needs an editor. i was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel pandora's star. he also has far too many main characters who (despite 800+ pages) never seem to come alive. they all speak with essentially the same voice. and when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped '60s era hippies -- come on does anyone seriously say dude in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century? and why is hamilton so obsessed with sex with young (or rejuvenated) women? hamilton's treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best. on the one hand the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed represented and believable. on the other hand the dynamics of the relationship between old timers and first lifers is unsatisfactory. in four centuries for example no one has even attempted to unseat nigel sheldon from his position as head of the sheldon dynasty? perhaps the commonwealth's continual expansion is the safety valve but even here the government (controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties) controls it. another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life didn't change -- i mean the characters of a novel (almost by definition) are dynamic go-get-'em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die. why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime? the aliens are ok. the problem with them (and this is true of nearly every sf story) is that they tend to be one dimensional -- they're all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up. (this is a problem in fantasy stories too.) on the plus side i do tip my hat to hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien deus ex machina. ozzie's adventures in wonderland (i.e. the silfen paths) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the dyson barriers but the knowledge doesn't really help anyone defeat the primes. overall if you started with pandora's star you probably should finish the journey with judas unchained. if you haven't started down this silfen path i recommend alistair reynolds tony daniel or iain banks. they write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than hamilton has proven himself to be to date ",negative

" ernest hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author valerie hemingway's story. for that reason this book merits only two stars. early in her story of meeting hemingway in spain in 1959 at age 19 valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality around him everything came to life....there was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb. when she stays focused on the story of ernest hemingway this is an endearing look at the older struggling hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of a moveable feast. but the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. as a result her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as a. e. hotchner's papa hemingway. the two years she spent living and traveling with hemingway through spain paris key west cuba and america share as much space as her weird marriage with hemingway's strange son gregory (apparently the other bull referred to in the title). it shows the continuing vitality of ernest hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a valerie hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man ",negative

" the book starts off ok with a good introduction of the various api's and is ok reading up untill chapter 6 programming linux audio. this is where the book fails terribly. none of the audio samples will compile and the information about openal is just plain wrong. first the function used to open a wav file is no the corerct function to use for linux. the author uses the win32 version. this is just the start of the openal errors. minus one star! second the book's two websites (one of which no longer exists (loki) ) contains no errata and no way to contact the author. the only information is avalible is a zip file of the books sample files (which do not compile of course). minus two stars! ohter things about the book that did not work for me was the fact that the author uses c instead of c++. while c is still used for game development most programmers are attempting to migrate to c++ and ood. books released about 1950 should reflect that! second the author uses tcl as a game scripting engine. while i can agree to a point (based on the fact of the easy of implementation) the author should have used a common scripting engine such as lua. (although the author does mention at the end of the book that tcl was proably a bad idea. third the author should have introduced autoconf very early in the book instead of waiting untill chapter 10. the main thing that i liked about the book was the good intro to programming with linux in general. the topics of linux debugging and makefiles i thought was good (assuming you have experince in these areas on other platfoms). also the coverage of sdl was a pretty good intro.

" there are no doubt a few nuggets of wisdom in this book but they are buried too deeply in bureaucratic gibberish to be worth digging up. this book has no bibliography no index mediocre footnotes no serious useful conclusions or strategic summary and a disturbing combination of american-centrism (on page 71: &quot;in the asian continent....(t)he first driver will be the future u.s. role in asia.&quot;) with a lack of intelligent presentation. there are exactly three figures and seven tables in this 336 page book when there should have been at least 30 tables and figures illustrating specific sources of conflict in relation to specific countries. the world conflict and human rights map (8 pages of graphics and 8 pages of fine print) out of leiden university does vastly more to inform than does this book. this book should never ever have been published in its present form--i venture to say that if it were condensed to 150 pages and properly edited with graphics and good synthesis it might be worthy of a second look. time is the most precious commodity in the world--rand managers and editors need to get serious about how they present possibly useful information to experts who want to know what rand thinks but cannot spare the time to get past cumbersome undisiplined--even lazy--preparations. the topic of this book is extremely important--those who would invest their scarce time and money in doing research in this area deserve better from those who put together this book ",negative

" i didn't have especailly high hopes for this book. i think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of hh books over the years and this one brings it to a new low. basically it's waaaaaay too long. at 850 pages it's a monster read and a slow one. that's not always a bad thing - sometimes if you like the characters it's nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page. but not here. why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language? for several paragraphs? more than once? why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services? i think i'd be in a very small minority when i confess that i quite like the 1662 prayer book though i can't quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it's been out of use here for decades! maybe it was easy to cut and paste and got the word count up. and then there's the space combat - a strength of the series especially the first three or four. but there's the rub - there are only so many ways you can describe a spaceship blowing up. by the 11th book in the series i can't be the only person out there whose eyes are beginning to glaze over when we get to the battle sequences. but the big problem - spoiler alert! - is the way in which weber solves the love triangle we left the last book with. honor loves hamish. emily loves hamish. hamish loves honor and emily. what to do? it turns out that there's an easy solution. after about 400 pages of agonising (not to mention most of the previous book) it seems that honor can marry them both. a bit outre? seemingly not - apparently such arrangements fall well within the accepted norms of manticoran law and custom. (although we've never had a whiff of this before.) but what really gets me is that the reason it didn't happen about halfway through the last book is that (get this) gosh no-one thought of it. it seems that no-one ever told mr weber that if you shoot someone with a gun in act v the gun better have been hanging on the wall in act i. all-in-all i can only say please mr weber. it is time to bring the series to an end. please do it soon ",negative

" this is the sort of book for paranoid people addicted to conspiracy theories. they would rather believe a fanciful lie than the mundane truth. though i don't agree with most of what's written in this book i don't regret buying it. it teaches me how to con ignorant people with high tech jargon and conspiracy theories. if people believe that amalgams or metal restorations are the cause of their headaches fatigue or whatever symptoms then removing them will definitely cure them. that's how faith healing works. the only reason why i don't use amalgam in my practice is because i do cosmetic dentistry. if the patient does not mind the colour amalgam is definitely a superior direct filling material for class 2 and subgingival preps. i have absolutely no qualms about having that done for myself. toxicity? sure some people are affected by amalgams and anything can be toxic to somebody but let's not forget that these cases are extremely rare (perhaps less than 10 on this planet and most of them would be chinese). there are literally thousands of tests and studies establishing amalgams as safe filling materials over the last 100 years. there are numerous studies that show how safe amalgams are. if dr breiner has been to asia where we have much healthier diets and lifestyles he may notice that we also have many healthy 70 to 90-year-old asian men and women who have gold and amalgam-filled teeth in their mouths. are composites totally safe? the incidence of allergic reactions to composites (very low) is higher than that of amalgam toxicity. this is something the author failed to inform us. all his anecdotal evidence are almost laughable as they are not supported by independent studies and sceptical parties. not one case he mentioned can be conclusively attributed to amalgam. mercury can be very toxic but after tituration and amalgamation the metal remains in the solid state and is not absorbed by the body. it's different from inhaling mercury vapour daily injecting or ingesting mercury or mercuric compounds. at the end of the day propagating such beliefs will only spark panic paranoia and various psychosomatic illnesses. following breiner's protocols for detox patients will only be paying a fortune for otherwise very simple dental work. gosh with so many gullible patients in america i should probably move my practice to america and start doing amalgam detox instead of honing my skills for cutting crowns bridges and sinking implants ",negative

" overall i found this book disappointing. in its defense its basic thesis of the movement of jewish american orthodoxy towards the `right' (more closed and intensely religious) is interesting and i am sure accurate and heilman's analysis of its evolution is insightful and well-researched. however i was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray hareidi society through the prism of its own value system or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all. heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations. examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture. hareidi society has its own worldview which although too complex to elaborate on here has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values reasons which heilman completely disparages or ignores. (for an example of a book that is not written by a religious author yet is able to appreciate hareidim from their own perspective try real jews by noah efron). in general i found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct (i.e. a defensive reaction to the holocaust) to be grossly insensitive to the hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition. the latter half of the book i found a pathetic attempt to draw conclusions from insignificant pieces of information. for example the juxtaposition of poster a condemning something to a poster advertising b implies that poster a is condemning b as well. or two posters (put out by the same company) advertising two different types of music indicates that the community is embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music. in conclusion although i eagerly awaited this book and found a fraction of it interesting and intelligent my overall impression is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative use of insignificant information.

" when i discovered the existence of this novel i was enthusiastic and intrigued. unfortunately my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages. kleopatra focuses on the famous queen's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family (something she may have compensated for in adulthood). what i liked: 1). the spelling of kleopatra/ cleopatra with a k- it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection; 2) kleopatra's strength of character- essex's general characterization is appropriate and it's easy to see what kleopatra will become. although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex it just didn't work for me. the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far-fetched. and although i loved kleopatra's love interest (i won't give away his name!) i felt it was a bit far-fetched as well almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something. kleopatra's dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe as was mohama. there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit... unnecessary. overall although kleopatra was a strong believable character she was in the minority. the novel as a sort of back-story to the queen of egypt didn't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction! at least the sequel is better. for fiction that works check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george.

" other reviewers have taken pains to outline the plot of this baby boomer bodice ripper. suffice it to say author kathryn harrison scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that more is better offers estrangement between identical twins loss of a child incest paternity confusion mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused new york shrink. this reader was aching for the hero will to book himself onto jerry springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from ms harrison like it's just...it's...what is it? will doesn't have a word for what he feels. (perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader: the author however should not. in any case those are lousy lazy sentences among so many examples.) in addition to being insufferably cartoonishly silly the book is wounded by a dreary internal structure. bad things happen to will-the-shrink will then regurgitates them at length to his shrink then buttonholes his wife to regurgitate what happened what he thinks happened and what he thinks about what his shrink thinks. as for ms harrsion's famous sex scenes. they practically lie on their backs fondling their adverbs and panting for penthouse approval: she's unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly almost unnaturally slippery. envy by the way is ms harrison's 11th book and she should by now be getting things more right than wrong ",negative
" this book is probably the worst written i've ever encountered. it was so flawed as to be considered literature. alice walker tries to one-up harriet beecher stowe in writing about brutality. titles like these are weapons used in the anti-black male agenda this society has long perpetuated. all the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. the women are portrayed as martyred forlorn pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell. the only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women. i've learned long ago when absolutes such as these are presented a greater agenda is at work. there are no real men in this book! only distorted caricatures of black masculinity. i only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. i find this title as dangerous as hitler's mien kampf in it's portrayal of black men as evil and morally destitute. presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. true there are criminally abusive men in every culture. but there are also forthright upstanding men as well. to present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about. harriet beecher stowe's fictional uncle tom's cabin sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war. this title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of black men. this book is fiction. howeverit is not presented as such. i'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents. i have no qualm about outrage at such abominations. however i do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations. that is what i find so unbelievable and offensive about this book. in my opinion this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it. i don't find it a testament to the strength of black women at all. i interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of african-american culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the black male as being hopelessly inhuman. i'm sure alice walker made a lot of money with this book. feminist racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature. i wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades were it a fictional depiction of white american men brutalizing white women. most definitely not!!! i doubt it would have even found a publisher. america is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of black men and african-american culture. my life as a black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion. whatever ms. walker's motivations were in writing this novel i'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted. this is racist misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature!

" herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the nazification of both germanies: did they side with israel in the middle east version of the cold war or did they not? the trial against paul merker in the east which had as its background east germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated jews serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things nazi in the gdr. but both of these arguments completely ignore the marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the east german leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. moreover they totally eclipse the east german cultural discourse on the holocaust a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the west and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in western academia.

" eliot cohen has an impressive background in policy work (osd) and academia (naval war college and harvard). i had high hopes for this book because i thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well-grounded work. i was disappointed. i never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals. he seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold. i could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way. the article might have made a good article in a foreign affairs journal but the author seemed to fill out the book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical stories and facts. the lincoln chapter providing nothing that has not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work. the churchill chapter was the best. cohen obviously has extensively studied churchill. his sections on how the historical view of churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well done thought not rally tied to the focus of the book. i learned the most from the ben-gurion since i knew the least about him. the book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying political leadership or foreign policy but beyond that the book unfortunately offers little that is new or of great interest.

" when i first picked up drinking coffee elsewhere i was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy. and truthfully it's not a horrible book. it is entertaining the style works etc. on that note if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking about it too much then by all means get it. my problem with the book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of america this is not your book. probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the african american female. packer has very little new to say and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by alice walker and other writers but have also have been said better by those authors. drinking coffee elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of you can't keep a good woman down a book that while having its own problems would probably be a better use of your time and money if you're really interested in the social commentary in the text. even from the literary standpoint it's not terribly outstanding. the characters are stereotypes; the plots are predictable. the adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person-- an intelligent outsider who struggles with race religion and fitting in-- and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so. the other protagonists are the same just not so irritable. similar to this lack of variation in her characters packer varies little in her narrative style. yes the language is pretty at times but there is no experimentation with language or structure; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice. finally the stories themselves contain scenes that aren't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative. in short drinking coffee elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books isn't actual talent but how much your publisher backs you. packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out ",negative
" it's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying. the majority of children of the mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about. the characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it. peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books and ender spouts off a bunch of trite up-with-people garbage every chance he gets. somehow card even managed to make jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during pms. the only decent characters in this book are miro and wang mu and they aren't nearly enough to save the story. i admit it: i only made it a little over half-way through children of the mind. i couldn't take the dialogue anymore. that's not to mention the ridiculous plot which centers on two children warping around the universe engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of japanese and polynesian culture in an attempt to avert a war between species. if you're that curious to learn how the ender quartet concludes do what i should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage ",negative

" this book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth. as some readers have complained this is not really a christian book because the focus isn't on christ it's on you. a biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally the way jesus would and not on trying to find the perfect spouse. the whole premise of the book is rather un-christlike: making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you. it's rather selfish really when you consider the words of john the baptist: christ must become more i must become less as well as the warning in song of solomon do not awaken love until it so desires. shouldn't our primary goal be to glorify christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires? finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines. hearts can be broken and therefore authentic christlike love must take precedence. i don't mean to sound accusing but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls seduction. my brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a poser. this happens when 'forcing yourself' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex. you have to ask: what kind of people are you trying to attract...people who are enticed by your masculinity/femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are? i personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality. it is a combination of both action and faith that is important. faith to set the situations up. action to knock em down ",negative

" i will not lash out against anyone and i will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious ostentatious egotism. that said let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes jesus of nathareth's solutions extremely difficult to accept. first off it doesn't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of jesus's morals in general terms. if we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us then we must provide a trenchant analysis of jesus's codices. the key point here is that jesus's older analects were deluded enough. his latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale. jesus's peuplade appears to be growing in number. i indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet i keep reminding myself that jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations circumvent any further litigation and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death -- all by trumping up a phony emergency. his desire to control your bank account your employment your personal safety and your mind is the chief sign that he's a slaphappy caitiff. (the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo treatment to cure my problem.) perhaps i'm reading too much into jesus's ravings but they don't seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests. jesus's prcis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent noxious feudalism. that's pretty transparent. what's not so transparent is the answer to the following question: does jesus's oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities? a clue might be that every time he tries jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions. this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought but for imagination as well. jesus's eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity. and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing. (remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil?) jesus of nathareth has an agenda -- a political social and cultural agenda. and that's all i have to say. ",negative
" i have an amazon bookmark that advertises ludlum's book the sigma protocol. it says in ludlum's latest an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy. well gee. that's the plot of this book as well. come to think of it that's the plot of every book by the man that i've read. a 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. they have small armies a lot of money and a plan. this time around a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the middle east and far left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). enter ordinary man joel converse. he's a vietnam vet and p.ow. who thought he had left that life far behind. it's up to him to save the world. he will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive and they just have to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). he will find love and he'll visit several european cities to boot. of course a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a nazi and an israeli are on the same side?) but ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. his dialogue writing is always tedious and sometimes just painful to read. action scenes are generic. the only thing he could do right is character background but that's not enough to save this. the aquitaine progression might make a half decent tv movie but to endure 700 pages is just too much ",negative

" paul ehrlich may understand butterflies more than most of us do but he definitely does not understand how the real world in general and the human society in particular works. he just does not seem to have sufficiently organized brain cells to think realistically about the world. this book starts with the bold statement that he had understood the population explosion for quite some time. nevertheless the whole book proves that it's not the case. all his reasoning is based on the worst possible extrapolation of the worst imaginable short-term trend. his assumptions therefore include the intelligent assumption that there won't ever be any technological progress in the future; the climate will evolve in the worst possible way and so forth. it's not surprising that he predicted that there would be mass starvation in the u.s. in the 1980s and even when this was shown to be complete nonsense he repeated the same prediction for the 1990s. why does he - and people like him - continue to produce predictions that have been humiliated so many times by the actual course of history? it's because of their religion. maybe they don't call it a religion but it is a religion nevertheless. jehovah's witnesses typically believe that there is going to be a judgement day. because it did not occur in 1918 and other years for which it was predicted they are a bit more careful and vague in their predictions nowadays. malthus had done very similar errors as ehrlich but you may think that in the 20th century people could know more than malthus knew many years ago. but ehrlich does not know more. in some sense even karl marx himself could be viewed as a producer of catastrophic predictions. marx predicted that something wrong would occur with capitalism as such and it would be globally replaced by communism. (this is what i call a truly catastrophic prediction.) marx was wrong of course because he completely misunderstood the magic power of the society and of the market to improve things that need to be improved and its ability to self-regulate and accomodate to new conditions. ehrlich is repeating all errors of marx and many other errors too. but other people who have a different kind of a religious belief that we must simply be approaching a judgement day can't learn from jehovah's witnesses mistakes. of course that paul ehrlich's reasoning has nothing to do with rational approach to important questions. (bjorn lomborg may be an example of a person who tries to solve very similar questions - namely these speculative questions about the long-term food problems - rationally.) ehrlich confuses the total amount of food available today and the total production of food; he does not understand that the efficiency of agriculture can increase much like the population or even more; he does not understand that the growth of the population in the developed world would be naturally reduced if it became difficult to feed children and so forth. he just does not understand the invisible hand of free markets and the visible hand of scientific and technologica progress and the power of human decisions. his reasoning could easily be proved wrong if he simply tried to make similar predictions about the past. but it was not his main goal to find a realistic prediction for the future. his goal was to write down pseudorationally sounding justifications of his religious preconceptions that would impress many people who are not exactly smart. the similarity between ehrlich's predictions of mass starvation and the recent predictions of catastrophic global warming is not just a superficial coincidence. find the book boiling point by ross gelbspan at this website - one of the silly recent books about the climate change disasters that expect us. among the 15 mostly positive reviews of the book you will also find a 5-star review by paul ehrlich of stanford himself! the global warming alarmists continue with the traditions of paul ehrlich. it is still the same pseudoscience and people will apparently always believe this kind of stuff because there are only two infinite things: the universe and human stupidity and i am not sure about the universe ",negative

" from the cover and a quick glances at some of the colorful photo filled chapters this book seem promising at first. but the cliched saying of never judge a book by its cover has taken its toll. this book provides marginal advice on how to -potentially- make a profit from the wonderful world of digital photography however it fails to give any real world working model on how this can be accomplished. most of the marginally useful advices and sales model i.e. pricing structure on stock photos are based on the author's own personal preference and experience rather than taking into account the wide breadth of pricing methods that exist in the real world of photography. this is a great book for amateurs that are trying to break into the business of selling their prints from an outline or a strict table-of-content perspective of the available methods and channels of distribution to target e.g. card stock stock photo art fairs etc. most of topics cover seem to be more 'theoretical' than actual real-world hands down information and the author seems to expend more time energy and care in expressing his disdain (with a condescending overtone might i add) toward enthusiastic amateurs that aim to make it big and quick. his favorite recurring adjectives for such amateurs includes but certainly are not limited to: prima donnas pretentious and pretend aficionado. heller may be a [self-aggrandizing] professional photographer but anyone with such high caliber should be more helpful than pompous or supercilious. remember heller you were an amateur at one point too. further more heller likes to take a seemingly interesting idea get your hopes up and then tell you why you shouldn't pursue it because the odds are just too high against you. bottomline: if you are serious about licensing your photographs for use then this book does not really cover the core foundations that you need to get your feet wet. on the otherhand if you want to take a look at what you can do to -potentially- make a profit from your hobby then this book basically gives you an -general- idea. i'd give this book a 1-star for the lack of usable information and the author's cockiness but it does contain some interesting theories and sales model to warrant a 2-star rating ",negative

" i bought this book before my first trip to austria. i had a sinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly a pastiche of unusable generalizations. that turned out to be true. what shall we do with a paragraph that tells us that austrian women are strong-minded and independent and organize their homelife well although many go to work? this book might have some value for a person who had never left their english-speaking homeland before and needed to be warned that people are sometimes naked in the sauna or at the beach. it also provides some amusing anecdotes about language (especially viennese) and useful info about festivals. mostly though this book was good for reading aloud to austrian friends. i would quote it as an iron-clad authority when their behavior didn't quite match the book's version and thereby amused them tremendously. --lynn hoffman author of the new short course in wine and the forthcoming novel bang bang from kunati books.isbn 978160164000 ",negative

" i tend to like just about anything that brubaker writes. while i'm not as excited about his marvel work as most others are i have enjoyed his runs on captain america and daredevil. his work outside of marvel has been great; sleeper is one of my favorite series over the last few years. in general brubaker had not written anything that i genuinely disliked. then came 'deadly genesis'. in short this is a weak story with several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor results. to what end? another summers brother who is completely disinteresting another story in which professor x acts like a jerk a dead x-men (for absolutely no good reason) and some horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key characters for the last 30 years. i want to think that this story was driven by editorial mandate. unfortunately this is the second instance in which brubaker has went back and altered marvel history from long ago. in captain america he made it so that bucky never really died in world war ii. this initially rubbed me the wrong way but the story itself was done well and the surrounding plots were good so i begrudgingly went along for the ride. i was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book. his attempt to revise history doesn't work nearly as well here. the key difference is that bucky had been considered dead for so long that there was very little continuity to adjust. he hadn't been written into any stories during all that time so it was very easy to go and insert an alternate history for him. in 'deadly genesis' brubaker inserts events into key storylines from 30 years ago. in order for them to work the reader needs to believe that several key characters has kept these events a secret from that time forward. it just doesn't work. to make matters worse none of the characters' motivation for anything makes any sense at all. characters are keeping secrets and other characters are upset with that and through the whole you never understand why. it's as if brubaker had an end goal in mind and simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point a to point b - even if it required characters to act contrary to their nature or the story didn't make complete sense. that aside another difference between the two is simply that this series is not written as well as captain america. they overall plot doesn't make complete sense and the characters are presented fairly shallowly. reading it was more of a chore than an act of enjoyment. the interior art is nice though not great. unfortunately the book falls so short on story alone that the art warrants almost no consideration ",negative

" need i say more than the above title suggests? okay so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience. there are some touching moments in this book but even then there is still something the author is lacking. i saw the movie when it was in theatres and i have just finished reading the book. i liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book. the movie was funny entertaining touching personal and sad at times. the book did not captivate me at all. i had trouble staying focused. considering beverly donofrio's credentials--a bachelor's degree in english from wesleyan university and a master of fine arts in creative writing--her quality of writing is very poor. her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education if even that. and not to go off topic but since donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like columbia u then why doesn't she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life? i mean after all the mfa is in creative writing meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time. she has only wrote 2 books--riding in cars with boys and looking for mary both about her getting pregnant at a young age. if you liked the movie just leave it at that. don't bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed. and if you're interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy then go to the local library. don't get this one. there's other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one.

" this is one of the silliest books i have read for a long time. it could be categorised as belonging to the same genre of action fantasy as a number of hollywood films. examples of the rules of reality being abandoned: the action takes place in the middle of antarctic winter and the author even notes at one point how it's pitch dark outside yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other. people spend minutes in freezing water yet pop out none the worse for the wear. two close allies of the united states attack a us installation on no better motivation than a claim that a spaceship has been found there shouted once through the radio. a 12-year-old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically nor apparently mentally. a prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it. the stupidity goes on and on but that's perhaps enough to give a taste. there are perhaps people who do not care about any of this but i don't enjoy books whose author doesn't have one bit of interest in any sort of realism ",negative
" the author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological/philosophical foundations of the emerging confession. there is value in that. i look forward to reading part two the liturgical ideas section. the emerging church is keen on praxis but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within christendom which i had hoped we were past. here are some things that i am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book which it might help to know: 1. rollins does not think it's possible to really know much theology with certainty. in fact to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an idolatrous view of god that is more our idea of god than really who god is. this is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans and because in his view god was not all that interested in presenting much of himself in any sort of nailed down way. the irony i could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views. he is very certain of his interpretations of perceptive thinkers like nietzsche freud and marx eckhart augustine etc... and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from scripture are correct. i found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really really faulty. as i'm reading along i kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the new testament. so be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the bible's basic content. he is certain that no one should be certain but him. ok to be fair he is not certain if christianity is true and says so on page 44 but he is certain that he should not be certain of christianity. nor i guess should you. with his view of critique of ideology how can he be so selective of what he is certain of. this seems like a self-defeating ideology. so strong is his disdain for knowing with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all. i was reminded of the case francis schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway. rollins needs to reread his francis schaeffer in my opinion. he says the church is not to be about giving answers but helping raise in people: questioning. indeed given his views how could he provide answers? this book may look deep. i propose it is merely muddy. 2. he redefines age old terms. orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes but how loosely one holds it. certainty of revealed truth is dangerous misinformed idolatrous. heresy is now a cute little thing. it has come of age. he says people will think his views undermine christianity. we are to just take him at his word that his views won't do so but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would i think see the writing on the wall. 3. he seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns. after reading his views i wonder if it is possible for post moderns those like himself at least to even understand the gospel. he has not. how can he be a bridge? to be a bridge one must have footing on both shores. christianity is based on real events with real content that has been passed down not without mystery nor without debate but in a very real and tangible way. he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else. 4. he is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them. the problem that is huge and no one seems to notice is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the christians who are in other camps. he considers fundamentalistsand by logical extension many evangelicals to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term heresy. i kept thinking what kind of fundamentalists is he so angry at? he blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals making generalizations that are misleading. very unobjective. unkind. very divisive. yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to christendom. i can see his views bringing unity to all religions but it will never bring unity to christendom. he seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in christendom. times have really changed in the past 20 years. he is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind. 5. he makes god hopelessly difficult. god wanted it seems to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people the dust of humanity the lowly donkey ride the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel. rollins has wrapped god up in nietzsche and while disdaining human reason as the means of knowing god has turned the living christ who said i am the truth into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it. god's message is simple. it's clear where it needs to be. it hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated. rollins makes it nearly all enigma hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking god who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it yet who has been unwilling or incapable given man's weaknesses or his own lack of communication skills to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly. if as tickle says this is the christianity of the 3rd millenium then the chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man's religion the anything goes religion and following generations will have to deconstruct today's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism. peter i can learn some stuff from you and i'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission. as it stands now i cannot agree with you on several points. your views trouble me. nothing against you personally. forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone. i hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more though it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor. regardless if it inspires i'll come back and add a star. hmmm ",negative

" i only glanced through this book yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied. i can however write about one of the editors mike shaw who made no attempt whatsoever to 'find the evidence' when assessing us as parents. he works as a consultant child psychiatrist in london england and seems to specialise in offering his services as an 'expert witness' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the mental health act. we had our children taken away on the grounds that they were at risk of neglect. mike shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations. yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched. under cross examination he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations. luckily for us he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist. i don't know about his co-editors but if his work is anything to go by the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced. here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court. judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously. evidence-gathering. on 9.8.02 i interviewed mr & mrs orman [2 hours] on 21.8.02 i met the family at trent park where i spoke to mrs orman alone [40 mins] witnessed contact [1 hour] and spoke to the children without their parents [20 mins] [and] i interviewed the foster carer [2 hours]. observations. mr & mrs orman were friendly and co-operative throughout.[...] mr orman showed insight [... but] wasn't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children. the couple were very robust in refuting the [welfare's] account which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation. contact took place in the park[...]the parents and children seemed happy to see each other; they chatted in animated style. [...] i wasn't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children's presence [interviewing the children] the children seemed attentive [...] but answered don't know fell silent and looked at each other when i asked them questions [...] erin related [a simpsons episode where] homer [...] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside. i found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about mr orman's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed. [note. this is submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document!] conclusions & recommendations [...] i observed mrs orman as shy and anxious while mr orman was very pleasant but forceful. [...] mr and mrs orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children. so it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact. [...] i think there is some insecurity in the children's attachment to their parents. [note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park.] were mr orman to be caring for the children on his own i would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs. [...] asked whether he had any regrets mr orman didn't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care. [...] erin [who was 8 at the time] needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper and support and advise socially. i suspect mr orman would find this difficult. my concern about mrs orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness. [...] i wonder whether mrs orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging [sic] children. [...]the children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact i observed [sic] and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home. [...] returning home is likely to further retard the children's social and emotional development. [...] these children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse. [...] it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause. i also find very plausible ms [charlotte] curran's suggestion (... [in] her [written] statement) that mr orman dominates his wife. the children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible. [..] i believe the children need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster carers. [...] contact should be gradually reduced. mike shaw's answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6-hour investigation. yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed so that the children could lead a normal and happy life. he could not comment on government statistics that show that 70% of all children placed in long-term foster care end up as delinquents. our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt; and the case was eventually closed. so much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions ",negative

" i first read this book back in the mid-80s after watching the miniseries starring gary cole as dr. jeffrey macdonald. the miniseries absolutely riveted me as did this book. but upon repeated readings i began to pick up inaccuracies and errors. i found that the book rather than answering questions about this case caused me to question more and more. joe mcginniss while never a stellar writer to begin with was eventually exposed as the worst kind of writer twisting facts and quotes to serve his own purpose which was to sell his theory and therefore his book. i have nothing against mr. mcginniss forming his own opinion as to dr. macdonald's guilt or innocence but to omit certain facts and blatantly lie about others and misquote principals and research in order to further your own propaganda is sickening. if you want joe mcginniss' theory on how and why the murders happened with no regard to the cold hard facts and legal evidence pick this book up. if you want to read about the case with all the facts in place both supporting and questioning dr. macdonald do as other reviewers have suggested and read fatal justice a far more in-depth review of the case and evidence and form your own opinion.

" the venona secrets is a deceptive book. it tries to pass itself off as an objective portrait of soviet spying in the us but by the time the reader is a third of the way in it becomes apparent that the authors are more interested in smearing liberals than in painting a true portrait of their subject. although the information the authors provide is interesting the biased and heavy-handed way it's presented negates whatever scientific value it might have. for example the authors insist that j. robert oppenheimer was working for the soviets (they call this a fact) yet they present absolutely no proof that oppenheimer was anything more than an idealistic naive man who couldn't keep his mouth shut and whose only contribution to the advancement of communism in america was money to the cpusa. the book is full of these so-called facts with little to nothing to back them up. the authors praise joe mccarthy and claim in the last chapter of the book that he was barely a factor in the anti-communist hysteria of the 1940's and 1950's ignoring the fact that mccarthy capitalized on fears of communism obscenely and was wrong far more than he was right about who was and was not loyal. mccarthy's methods of terrorism and hypocrisy in running hearings that could have been chaired by stalin are completely overlooked as are the innocent lives he destroyed in his smear campaign. the authors also praise senator henry jackson as some sort of all-american crusader against communism not even mentioning that all of jackson's anti-communist attacks were motivated by his virulent anti-semistism and hatred of blacks. overall this book is nothing more than an indictment of liberal ideology -- one can simply hear the disdain for liberals dripping from the authors' prose -- and should not be given much credence by scholars not interested in right-wing propaganda who want an objective account of venona. the authors have sacrificed their credibility for their conservative agenda; they deserve not to be taken seriously ",negative

" more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas. the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn't make that connection having read a few of faulkner's works. sturgeon uses many of faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious first person perspective of low iq individuals disorienting changes in first person narrative) but i didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying. i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously. this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books. more than human is slow dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others. so the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis esp computer-brain babies and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (asimov) and since. this book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages. this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best. in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book (determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored. besides more than human the far superior the caves of steel childhood's end and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi. needless to say more than human did not win (farenheit 451 did and rightfully so) bottom line: i wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise. these are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests ",negative

" i was very excited when i got my copy of this book. i am a big fan of medical thrillers. i started with robin cook and michael palmer and from then on i was hooked. unfortunately for me i selected the wrong book. it was very slow and he didn't pick up the pace until i was about 60 pages from the end. then all hell broke loose. i have a feeling that josh got a little help from people telling him to spice it up. all in all i was disappointed and still don't know what perv means. hope he does better on his second. i will give it a try but only the first 50 pages. if he hasn't hooked me by then i'll give up ",negative
" this book was given to me by my cousin who thought i might find faith after hearing the eulogy i gave at my father's funeral a year ago in which i professed that i do not know if there is a god or not but that the best we can do is be good people. i am agnostic in that i am fully aware that there is no factual evidence that god exists and that there is no evidence that god does not exist. to be clear - if there was i am pretty sure it would be widely publicized. the gift was a loving gesture and i am sincerely appreciative of it. however i have several issues with the book. more than i can possibly iterate at this point. this book does not even mention agnosticism. as the author was educated at yale i am sure he must be aware of agnosticism and chose to omit it from his book. i can only presume that it was omitted with a reason perhaps it was too hard to explain in the face of his assertion that there is evidence for god (see below - all circumstantial and requiring leaps of faith). without getting into too many specifics the evidence he uses in the case for faith comes from obviously christian sources - which are surely biased. this is equivalent to reporting on terrorist acts by only interviewing terrorists. certainly one's reporting would be validating reasons for such atrocities. to be clear i am only drawing this distinction to make the point - a true investigative reporter would look to include both sides of the story and present facts as opposed to opinion. had strobel intended to provide a balanced view he would have used non-christian scientists and believers of various faiths. strobel's statements portend to be fact but are generally lacking any actual evidence and in some cases are easily determined to be incorrect. a couple of examples are 1) his statement that buddhism says there is no god (various sects of buddhism believe in gods state there is no creator god or do not take a stand on the matter) and 2) his statements on lack of evidence for evolution - specifically macroevolution (which is fairly well supported by actual evidence and observation - and believed to be accurate by 99% of biologists). regarding evolution there is actually evidence for macroevolution - although he claims there is none. this is where i have serious problems with the book. in my opinion the book is more for current believers who need/desire to strengthen their faith which i believe is a good thing. however his information lacks factual support and evidence which to me is a bad thing. i believe that most of the people who would read it would not get to the point of questioning the information in it. if one were to question it one could easily find their faith destroyed if the information one held to be true (and which subsequently was the basis for faith) is found to be false. he states that there is evidence for intelligent design; however the evidence he offers is only theory in the colloquial sense - i.e. a guess. the theory of evolution is a theory in the scientific sense - i.e. supported by on observation and evidence. another example is when strobel quotes ...when it comes right down to it the only person or thing i know of worth my faith - the only one supported by the evidence of history and archaeology and literature and experience - is jesus. the buddha (meaning one who is awake) or siddhartha gautama (his real name) was an actual person supported by all of the above listed proof of jesus. mohammad was also an actual person supported by all of the above. his 3 reasons for disbelief in reincarnation (for regular people): 1) if james loses 3 pounds he is still james if he becomes a grasshopper he is not james - because he is not human 2) support for past lives - such as memories are explainable by psychological explanations lucky guesses or demonic possession 3) the only expert on this question jesus of nazareth said it doesn't happen. to respond: 1) to believe in resurrection one must believe that there is a substance which makes us who we are that is not tied to our earthly form. it is not tied to being human but to existing. 2) how do you discount the possibility that reincarnation exists by asserting that demon possession exists - there is factual evidence for neither. 3) to be in line with this reason one must already accept the divinity of jesus and that the resurrection actually happened. his arguments for the truth of the resurrection (below) are weak and offer no support for the fact only that people claimed it happened. we should not confuse the fact that jesus existed with the belief that he was the son of god and specifically that he was reincarnated. here are his proof that god exists: 1) god makes sense of the universe's origin 2) god makes sense of the universe's complexity 3) god makes sense of moral values (his argument is - if there are absolute moral values then god must exists god makes sense of the resurrection (see proof below). 4) god can be immediately experienced. to respond: 1) theories can be used to explain phenomenon that correlate to reality but are not truly an explanation of reality. one still must take a leap of faith to believe his assertion. while it may explain questions about the universe - how do we know it to be accurate? put another way there are other explanations that could wrap up the universe - additionally one presumes he is speaking of the christian god and discounting other belief systems. 2) see my first objection. same point. 3) science believes in hard observable facts being the basis for making assertions. the basis of scientific fact is that it is able to be recreated by anyone. to take the leap from the fact that there are widely accepted truths to being proof of god requires faith. he gives examples of ideas that most of the civilized world thinks are wrong and uses them as the basis for absolute moral values. he omits that moral values have changed over time and are evolving. while i do believe that things are wrong one can easily recognize that they are not always absolute...for example it is not ok to kill unless you are in danger - or the other person killed others (presuming you believe in capital punishment). 4) his example here is that you cannot prove the world exists...fair enough but one can prove there are universally experienced events that we can demonstrate over and over again. for example we can do a physics experiment and everyone involved will see the same results (barring psychological conditions). while we may not be able to prove that the world exists we can confirm common experience which is essentially what the world is...the ground on which we all interact - whether or not that is created in the mind (the example he gives for how the world may not exist is that all of the world may only be in our mind). proof jesus was resurrected: 1) the location of jesus' burial was widely known and agreed on. 2) the sunday after his crucifixion the tomb was empty which is agreed upon by many (or all). 3) various groups of people experienced appearances of jesus alive again. 4) the original disciples suddenly and sincerely believe that jesus was risen from the dead - even enough to die for this belief. to respond: 1) this is fact and jesus did exist. not sure how it relates to his divinity. 2) this could be explained in several ways hard to use this as proof of his divinity. one can suppose it is but it takes a leap of faith - this book is supposed to explain how to have faith - but continually requests we make leaps of faith. 3) writings of people who claims to experience jesus can hardly be taken as fact. other religious text would claim the same about their prophets gods etc. 4) the disciples had a vested interest in proclaiming the divinity of jesus. this is not actual evidence. this is equivalent to stating that the bible is true because it says it is true. additionally strobel chooses which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical. in dealing with objection 5 strobel notes that the descriptions of hell in the bible are metaphorical. it is hard to discern how someone can pick and choose which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical. it is convenient to do so when your explanations support your understanding. i am not sure how you justify doing this. he states that only one religion can be right or god is schizophrenic. one supposes his assertion is that christianity is the one true religion or god is schizophrenic. this again is a leap of faith. one must also presume that the various religions are not human error in interpreting god's message. my stand is this we do not know and to have faith is great however by creating a context in which one can have faith by providing erroneous and undeniably false/biased information a false faith is created. faith should be born out of one's desire and belief system. one should not need to discount others because of their faith. to me doing so indicates weakness in their faith - not strength.

" i love how many people like to say that lawrence walsh was a republican. funny. he was an eisenhower republican worlds removed from the conservative movement. and let's face it: he stink bombed george h.w. bush at the end of the 1992 campaign when bush was gaining ground on clinton. i'm not saying bush would have won if walsh hadn't indicted caspar weinberger on the friday before the election but walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for bush. bush got him back of course by pardoning weinberger on christmas eve 1992. the beginning of the book was interesting to say the least. as it wore on however it became a prosecutor hoping to go down in history whining about republicans. let's face it: people in power tend to be corrupt. they have protection the rest of us don't have. this wasn't just true about reagan and bush; it's true about clinton and whoever you wish to name. about halfway through the book walsh concentrates his fire on the guy who was vp at the time ghw bush. i also find the fact it was endorsed by a number of liberals interesting to say the least. i guess when you can't beat a guy at the ballot box you impeach him or at least try to. right? not worth the investment of time or money - but does have some good historical information inside.

" i grew up reading harold evan's sunday times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could. i particularly remember comprehensive coverage of egyptian president sadats historic visit to jerusalem; ongoing coverage of soviet dissidents and a very welcome (i'm irish) editorial urging britain to consider withdrawal from northern ireland. however from today's perspective the paper's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as `what would the world do without henry kissinger?' [indeed this has always seemed to be mr. kissinger's view also]; and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation. my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan. a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles (ss-20s?) being deployed in russian forests. i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002/3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of saddam's mobile chemical/biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist. in saying all the above i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch. the book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made evan's sunday times great - the investigative reports from the insight team and others of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry (thalidomide) and the aircraft industry (mcdonnell douglas); the publication of the crossman diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet. having established his credentials as a `vertical' journalist - evan's term which he describes as `seeking to get to the bottom of things' - and lauding his proprietors the thomson's for allowing him to do so the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr. murdoch as owner. the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating the thomson's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors. murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of `national directors' guarantees which if breached were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction. as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times - one of the free worlds most revered titles. in his description of the paper evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment - he sees it as the paper of record upholding fair non-partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect. one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people's educational background almost every colleague is named and then his/her school and university are listed - for example joe smith winchester oxford to establish both social class and academic (perhaps intellectual) credentials. he documents the `four pillars' of the times as its reporting of parliament its legal coverage its obituaries and its leader columns. oh dear! stolid stuff from the fearless vertical investigative editor. nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which by implication criticise his predecessor as editor (william rees mogg); and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution. looming behind this story is murdoch's general management style - haphazard interventions secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning. from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans. the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth - murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors. the text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone save perhaps murdoch evan's second-in-command betrays him various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys the `national directors' turn out to be paper tigers (this is too good a pun to delete) the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken piecemeal. the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious double-dealing murdoch whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval. however by the time i got to this section i had sadly lost a lot of respect for evan's impartiality his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities. this was reaffirmed in my mind when on the day that evan's agreed to reign who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger! in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor initially at least popular. evans though personally engaging - and i'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs. the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union. the fading indeed failing social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides. i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change. the rest of the story - evans attractive forthrightness murdoch's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story are ultimately a side show. this book is well told highly dramatic and engaging however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done.

" the first novel of laurell k. hamilton's merry gentry series is not actually that terrible a book. it's by far the best in a not particularly great series actually. what made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise the set-up is one of the most grotesquely ridiculously stupid things i've ever read. princess meredith nicessus has fled faerie in fear of death at the hands of her aunt andais the queen of air and darkness and ruler of the unseelie court. high profile fae in this world are major public figures like rock stars or the royal family of england. the sudden disappearance of one of the unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. we are told solemnly that reports of princess meredith being spotted are right up there with elvis sightings. meredith's image the story of her mysterious disappearance is everywhere. i mean neolithic pygmies living in deepest africa know who meredith is and what she looks like. meanwhile princess meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. thing is she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. her fae red hair is now human red hair. her facial features remain the same. and with everyone on the planet wondering where is princess meredith for years on end no one recognizes her. let me hasten to add there is no magic involved in this they honestly simply don't recognize her. and the crowning touch to this masterful disguise the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually princess meredith is....wait for it....merry gentry. jesus wept. and for years none of her co-workers no one who knows her says to themself hey wait a minute that women who looks almost exactly like princess meredith....merry gentry....princess meredith....oh my god merry gentry is princess meredith! nope she's just incognito baby. at which point i almost threw down the book and said you have got to be kidding me. it's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. do laurell hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? given her past six or eight novels including this one i'm tempted to say: no actually ",negative

" i really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great. a shocking murder is committed in the town of newpointe then another. meanwhile fireman mark branning has moved out and is separated from his wife allie. there is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and allie and mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage. i wanted to like this book because it is a christian novel with a good purpose. ninety percent of the books i've read have been secular but i'm starting to read more christian novels. but to me this book fails for three reasons: the marriage conflict between mark and allie isn't believable the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing. mark and allie's marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he hasn't convinced her otherwise. seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery but it is grounds for suspicion. yet allie assumes mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman. it seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight. instead mark and allie separate and allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair. blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between mark and allie. throughout the book references are made to allie believing mark had an affair with issie. allie refers to mark's act as adultery and recalls him lying his way out of it after allie caught him hugging issie. their marriage is struggling but blackstock should have given more reasons why allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book mark says he didn't have an affair and allie chalks it up to one of his lies. later in the novel blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late. the serial killer story is poorly done and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book. when they book a suspect at the end it seems ridiculous. the police work feels like it was written by an amateur. one line in the novel as much as the evidence pointed to xxx stan didn't want to believe it. in my opinion the evidence didn't point to that person and stan the detective seems foolish for believing it. there isn't any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story. there is no sense of setting in the book. there are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other. finally this book talks about god and prayer and being saved throughout the book and that's great. with a serial killer on the loose a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way. at one point a conversation goes like this: how can the murder be part of god's plan? maybe it isn't that would mean god isn't in control. he is in control but he allows some things to happen. then at another point mark says to allie i'm going to be fine it's time to trust the lord. he's taken care of us so far. then allie says: but i don't know what his plan is. i don't know how he wants this to end. i don't know what he wants to teach us. at other points in the book characters say that god has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of god's plan and that through god's plan all things can be used for good. this line of logic is infuriating. bad things happen to everyone including god's people. god doesn't allow a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife. that's a horrible message to send to a non-christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck. telling them it was part of god's plan is the quickest way to turn someone from god. god is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and god can even keep bad things from happening to christians. but like above where allie was afraid because she thought god might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson god doesn't willfully kill people. it comes down to the simple fact that all people including serial killers and christians have choices to make and have free will. i'm surprised i wrote so much on an 8 year old book but i wanted it to be a good book.

" the advice in this book is solid and appropriate for most kids. however the writer's attitude is judgmental. if you are buying this book it's probably because your child's eating has not gone as smoothly as you'd like. for most of us a lot of our parental self-esteem is wrapped up in this issue. so it just makes no sense to act as if it's usually the parent's fault - why alienate and beat up your target audience???? plus while i'm sure that some parents contribute to kids' eating issues plenty of kids are just born more sensitive! if you can read between the lines and get to the take home message without letting her attitude get to you more power to you - otherwise go elsewhere.

" melrose larry green's book is full of quotes. quotes and information used to back up points are good things. he appears to have researched by surfing the internet watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others. this is all fine and acceptable. the problem with why the clintons belong in prison is when the author (cut and paste expert) attempts his own narrative which is sporadic jumpy and poorly edited. his points are not linear and show the author's attention deficit. with a proper literary team this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a hit and run report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program.

" perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others. lacking even the slightest trace of shame he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses. as a result there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages. even more pitiably like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to sanitize his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed. one wearies quickly of the manichaean results. and like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was. why even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home's 1977 underground classic a savage war of peace!* considering that home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot's this is irony most profound. it is scarcely surprising then that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in boot's book thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot's espoused belief system. * recently reprinted and highly recommended!

" i love peterson's guides but the birds of mexico is severely lacking. the art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to north america but unfortunately it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other peterson guides. perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of peterson guides but otherwise buy howell's or edward's guides both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone. howell's is certainly the most complete but edward's guide is a bit handier in the field ",negative

" i have progressively become more and more disappointed with rita mae brown's books in the past decade. her early books were utterly magnificent; now she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite (and by now utterly boring) themes -- southern manners horse bloodlines and foxhunting. blessedly whisker of evil was foxhunting-free but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two. rita mae brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of virginia and many of us have grace manners and respect for others -- and we don't take kindly to being told that only virginians understand these things. that's just simply not true. that said there were some delightful aspects of whisker of evil -- the mystery itself was great the animal characters were adorable as ever and i loved learning more about harry as a person and what makes her tick. her quitting the post office was a great (and very unexpected) twist. i liked reading more about her home and her relationships. however the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me; was this directed at a heretofore-unknown segment of rita mae brown's fan base? it was so out of context in this book; certain details contributed to the horses' relationships to one another but she took it way too far and i found myself skipping pages. as well i almost threw the book across the room when i came across a line that stated in so many words that only virginians have manners. this is a common theme of ms. brown's and it is quite frankly offensive. there is a big big world outside of virginia -- rita mae brown should know this she has lived in it -- but her books and characters have become so parochial insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world. i would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek if it wasn't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade. enough already about southern manners (a biased perception at best) ancestor worship bloodlines (human and horse) and foxhunting. whatever happened to characters like celeste chalfonte ",negative

" this is one of the worst-written programming books i have seen yet. i'm sorry i bought it. it appears to be written by a man who knows quite a bit about finance and dangerously little about c++ programming. duffy's review correctly describes the main flaws. i would add that (1) the book is not structured to build upon oo gof patterns or stl design principles; (2) the code does not follow even basic c++ coding conventions; (3) the images (screenshots) are agonizingly unreadable; (4) the code listings are in italics using a variable-pitch font [is courier font code listing so difficult to include in a $100 book???]; (5) no over-arching component object model is suggested anywhere in the book. some of the efforts at brevity are just plain wrong or even dangerously wrong to teach beginning programmers. for example pg 19 data types section: ---------------- int - holds integer numbers up to a little over 2 million for example int i = 2000000;. long - same as int. ---------------- wrong professor! this is not only a syntactically incorrect example but a just plain wrong assertion. if the reader does not know how to determine the (platform-specific) size of an int or long then the author has only served to confuse the matter further! furthermore i consider it a cheapskate tactic to ask readers to pay for the code from this book in electronic form (particularly when the book's code listings are so sloppy). that said i would not use the code even if it had been supplied for free ... but it *might* have been interesting to have something to play around with... have any of the reviewers actually used any code from this book without substantial refactoring? the only use i could see for this book is for intermediate-advanced fin-techs who want to review a few general algorithms for selected derivative calculations (futures forwards etc) ... but just be prepared to squint and suffer through reading the code ",negative

" the photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition's cover. however you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of the doorbell rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances. the mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen. with just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. the favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story. the doorbell rang begins with a mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son sam and daughter victoria. i've made some cookies for tea said ma. the children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to grandma's. by flipping through the pages of the doorbell rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats. the cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention. more kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie. it is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth. the serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer. meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail. the final arrival for this story is grandma with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. all the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table. not very sanitary as far as i am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. the dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home. the portrayal of the mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. the kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them. at least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the mother finally sat down. for a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read i highly doubt there would be interest. there is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child's grandma's cookies. there are roughly two to four sentences on each page. the good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this ",negative
" the premise put forth in the title is supported by some keen insights into leadership by calling and comparisons to it with modern leadership theory. les csorba writes about the danger of pursuing results without compassion; a point with which i agree. unfortunately some of the examples he chooses are questionable... after warning about the danger of weak character in powerful leaders csorba chastises german chancellor schroeder for turning back on some promises to george w bush regarding the war on terrorism and then goes on to deride him for his four wives. meanwhile he praises jack welch for going from neutron jack to a gentler jack (which jack says he would abandon if needed)while still making the tough decisions that got the results for the shareholders. jack can change is mind and go back to compassionless results... ok. also there is no mention that jack was getting results with his personal secretary whilst the wife was at home... unfortunately the theme in csorba's examples becomes one of bashing the mistakes of democrats and forgiving the sins of the republicans. he does sprinkle in some condemnation for a few wrong-minded republicans in a meek attempt at balance. it's a shame that he turned this into a politcally tainted work. it started off so well. it started off well even though it will turn off readers who are not people of faith as faith is central precept to this book. it also started off well even though he chose to make george w bush the role model for how to be a trust-able leader. unfortunately this conservative/political bent turned an even harder right from there and kept going. it kept going to the point that i could no longer plan on sharing this book with some folks i know who really need it. they would simply say its a bush-ie/right-winger book and dismiss the valuable and otherwise soundly argued premise. too bad. csorba almost had a classic instead of a politically tainted leadership manual. i say this even though i am republican am one of the few folks who would admit they were voting for bush before the election am a person of faith and tend to find the dems an easy target. but this book was supposed to be about so much more than republican politics. too bad ",negative
" if we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the prague spring and street protests in the u.s. as kurlansky attempts in this book the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year. the reader is owed specifics yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes. prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent but prohibited it. chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government however flawed resulting from open debate. a bigger difference could hardly be imagined. but kurlansky does see striking differences albeit only in the post-1968 world. the soviet bloc began it's decent to oblivion while the capitalist west avoided the same. his disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean though what manner of revolution he envisions is never rendered to specifics likely for good reason. but who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do ",negative

" i originally had to read this book for a history of rock and roll class at the university of cincinatti. i found the subject interesting and the professor gave wonderful lectures. i had good expectations about this book going in but those quickly soured as i read it. it seems correct at least about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock. not that such is a particularly daunting feet. however it is rife with laughable fallacies. for instance it calls david bowie amongst other glam rock bands of the era metal. it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all such as the carpenters. i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore. bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap. further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book. i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs. for instance it claims 'thunder rolls' by garth brooks is about domestic violence. its about infedility not focusing on violence at all but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on. the writing is also rather dry. many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence. it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band's successes or failures. after reading the book in completetion i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues (50s to 60s) that i had thought were true. in the end i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything ",negative

" i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years. i was born & raised in the north. i think evans should rename his book fiddler on the roof in the south. his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here. it's very much: the southern jews were all so happy they all fit in and were accepted etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'yankee jews' like the instances when a few (yankee)rabbis in the south fought for civil rights. evans should realize that times have really changed here! the evangelical christians in my town (which is most people here) harrass me like crazy - 'i am praying for you!'

" what this is: an epic adventure. it would be imappropriate to review the wot series when speaking of the prophesies of the dragon book; it's also not really a supplement akin to say the monster manual for d&d--the only extra skills feats backgrounds etc are those directly related to npcs in the campaign. what prophecies is designed to do is take a party of characters through their first six levels of adventuring which correspond roughly to the first six books of the series of novels. the players are allowed to play a key behind the scenes role in the story of the novels and cameos have been scripted for many of the book's key characters. it's a really ambitious undertaking; players have to be given a compelling storyline feel like they're making a difference in a campaign that covers over a year of game time without letting them change what happens in the novels. does it work? i am currently gming this adventure. on paper it looks really good. some of the scenes especially in the later parts of the story look exciting moving even. faile's cameo is perfect for example. in practice though it's been an extremely frustrating experience. first the early encounters (as pointed out by another reviewer) are unnecessarily difficult and add nothing to the plot. as things progress the authors presume too much on the goals and motivations of the players. there is one chapter for example where the introduction says something along the lines of upon entering the city the players will want to find (a certain npc) as soon as posible and will definitely want to investigate the actions of (another npc). the players in my campaign knew they wanted to talk to one of these guys eventually but the other one was off their radar completely. throughout i've had to improvise ways to keep them approximating the plot line of the campaign and by chapter 3 they're feeling very manipulated. the campaign assumes the party wants to do nothing more than hunt down dark friends and expose evil plots and will take great personal risk and go through great hardship (including at one point a monthlong trek through a winter wilderness without adequate provisions) on the chance of thwarting same. characters with any other motivations (say a character modeled after mat or nynaeve in the books) will feel forced into situations unnaturally. there has been more than one point where one of the players saying i *think* this is where the plot wants us to go. so in conclusion while this adventure is excellent in its dreams and scope--and it's definitely better than something i could have designed myself--but it will fail often fail as a game. if you are intending to run a wot campaign buy this adventure read it so that you thoroughly understand its scope before you even let your players make up characters. the characters need to be created to fit the story or the story won't work ",negative

" more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas. the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn't make that connection having read a few of faulkner's works. sturgeon uses many of faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious first person perspective of low iq individuals disorienting changes in first person narrative) but i didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying. i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously. this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books. more than human is slow dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others. so the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis esp computer-brain babies and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (asimov) and since. this book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages. this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best. in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book (determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored. besides more than human the far superior the caves of steel childhood's end and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi. needless to say more than human did not win (farenheit 451 did and rightfully so) bottom line: i wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise. these are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests ",negative

" never in my life have i been so outraged by what i have read as by the drivel spouted by dr. west in this book (in his translator's note) and by the use of `unponderingly' and the thinkery (among other things) in his translation of the clouds. i also read his translation of plato's apology of socrates and found it grossly inferior to jowett. four texts on socrates is not a book to be tossed aside lightly: it should be hurled with great force. (apologies to dorothy parker.) not only are the translations themselves inexcusably inept almost everything that he writes in his translator's note is wrong. the clouds is a play not a scientific or mathematical treatise. as such it has characters and dialogue. a `modern' translation of a play must be something that could be presented on a stage and make sense to a `modern' audience. if a character is supposed to be bizarre or out of the ordinary one does not make him spout drivel such as 'unponderingly'; one gives him a `shtick' which is a theatrical term. it's more or less a running gag associated with a particular character. you create through clever ways of speaking or odd ways of stringing his words together a characterization. he could be made to speak like a parody of william f. buckley or the star wars character yoda. as it stands west's text cannot be presented as a play. it is neither necessary nor useful to coin such nonsense as 'unponderingly'; indeed it is inexcusable. it conveys neither humor nor cleverness. it comes off simply as stupid. the translator of a play must know something about theatre and drawing characters which dr. west obviously does not. to state it bluntly: the translation of plays should be left to people who understand theatre and characterization and who are creative. dr. west doesn't have a creative bone in his body. in regard to his translation of plato's the apology of socrates the translation by dr. west is both original and good but the parts that are good are not original and the parts that are original are not good. after all when one has the work of such a brilliant predecessor as benjamin jowett to follow the temptation to do something entirely different is strong. but it must be resisted. if dr. west had merely lightly revised jowett's great work he would have made a contribution to learning. alas he did neither. the version by jowett is clearly superior. here is a short excerpt: and i must beg of you to grant me a favor: if i defend myself in my accustomed manner and you hear me using the words which i have been in the habit of using in the agora at the tables of the money-changers or anywhere else i would ask you not to be surprised and not to interrupt me on this account. for i am more than seventy years of age and appearing now for the first time in a court of law i am quite a stranger to the language of the place; and therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger whom you would accuse if he spoke in his native tongue and after the fashion of his country: am i making an unfair request of you? never mind the manner which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words and give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly. compare west's inept version: ...i do very much beg and beseech this of you: if you hear me speaking in my defense with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak both in the marketplace at the money-tables where many of you have heard me and elsewhere do not wonder or make a disturbance because of this. for this is how it is: now is the first time i have come before a law court at the age of seventy; hence i am simply foreign to the manner of speech here. so just as if i really did happen to be a foreigner you would surely sympathize with me if i spoke in the dialect and way in which i was raised so also i do beg of you now (and it is just at least as it seems to me): leave aside the manner of my speech--for perhaps it may be worse but perhaps better--and instead consider this very thing and apply your mind to this: whether the things i say are just or not. for this is the virtue of a judge while that of an orator is to speak the truth. speaking...with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak? how utterly inept and repetitive! didn't he even proof-read? one doesn't speak with 'speeches' one speaks with words! it is obvious that dr. west never read his version aloud as a test of its appropriateness which is surprising because this work is supposed to be a speech. dr. west's version is clearly not suited to speaking aloud whereas jowett's is. in west's translation socrates is a clumsy repetitive and inept speaker. needlessly so. if you want to read a good translation see jowett's 3rd edition (1892). why does dr. west believe himself qualified to make translations? nothing in his work suggests that he is competent in any way to do so. this is not the work of a scholar but that of a bungling hack. these translations are travesties. how does work this nauseatingly bad get published? not recommende ",negative

" by chance before picking this up i had just finished the heart is a lonely hunter by carson mccullers and was struck by the similarities and differences. it's a great compare and contrast pair as an exercise for high-schoolers. both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. heart published in 1940 and castle in 1948 both about life in the 30s. both families are poor. in castle though there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. this is supposedly because they don't know how to do anything. so instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. how charming! they are eccentric which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. only stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper enamored of cassandra does work and gives the family his entire salary. but he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum topaz--striking poses. unlike the looming and grinding poverty of heart then the poverty in the castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. not so in america where mick kelly who didn't know how to do anything either went off to work at woolworth's and to a life of little hope. in castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina the inheritance. two dashing young wealthy americans one of whom has inherited the castle show up just in time with their chatty modern mum. they throw money around and talk too much in the cliched extravagant american style. most of the remainder of the novel consists of cassandra and her sister rose swooning over one brother or the other with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being. it's all so very charming bourgeois and harmless. if your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you! the reviews for this novel in amazon are overwhelmingly positive. smith was obviously talented. her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. i wish she had given cassandra a little more ambition.

" after reading the trilogy i was left wondering what the hell happened? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker. pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. there isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. if you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary you'll see a picture of this book. from first page to last time is wasted on boring characters while all the good ones are either killed off or just mia for the entire book. spoilers ahead. what about lyra and her parents? somehow she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. over a cup of tea naturally. and that's it for him. in addition to all that this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . . all in the last 30 pages. what happened to the story for cripes sake?! and what happened to the `temptation'? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with. as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other. the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. supposedly they had more than gonads going for them they survived death together! pullman didn't feel like thinking it through he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. in addition to that he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. all of will and lyra's efforts are futile kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons. after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. iorek byrnison lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun. pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter! this is not children's literature it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. it's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book or even as a competent work of fiction. all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one. we never get closure on lyra's parents. we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from. we never see will reunited with his mother. we get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. lyra and will fall in love but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever with only flimsy reasoning behind it. the mulefa and mary malone's work together amounts to nothing everyone just goes home. presumably will goes home although we never see it. all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. it all just sort of disovles. mary forgot to be the serpent or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa. another reader pointed out: phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. instead the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. what a waste of time. i can't believe this book actually won awards. it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly. it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. instead relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime. absurd. this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life.

" i was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment. one would think that a 'scholar' such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the hebraic roots of judeo-christianity. it was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known messianic signs spoken of in the gospels. he is also clueless to the pharisidical judaism of the time..not comprehending that all of christ's teachings were completely in keeping with true judaism. all of which can be found in contemporary rabbinical teachings of his time. this book which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels. like it or not..the new testament writings are hebraic and explain what fulfilled judaism is. those who need to divorce judaism from christianity are offering a church which is already confused just more confusion. it is through studying the hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the 'difficult' sayings of our lord; 'fullfillment of the law' binding and loosing (the law)..etc as well as the parables. the delivering of the deaf mute..was a messianic sign because the rabbi's knew that 'they' had to ask the said demon its name but he did not. lazerus's resurrection was a messianic sign because the rabbi's believed that anyone could come back to life during the first 'three' days after death. cleansing of a leper was messainic sign because the rabbi's understood that it was a 'divine' punishment that only god could lift. how else can we link isa 53 with the 'stripes' he was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the law required for transgression and yet 'minus one'. had our lord transgressed the law then the jews themselves could have legally killed him. remember paul (saul)? he also does not understand john and his huge part in the whole picture in that the kingdom 'began' with john. he was the 'breachmaker' as fortold in prophecy. this is hebraic roots 101. people please study the hebraic roots of christianity and do not waste your time with this book. the fact that he keeps defending his position as 'not' anti-semetic should give you a clue ",negative

" susanna rowson's &quot;charlotte temple&quot; is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman. poor pitiful charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin. rowson encases her heroine charlotte temple within a world of virtue and vengeance. charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman. she has no real interest in charlotte as a dimensional character. charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings. &quot;charlotte temple&quot; was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed america. a morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now &quot;charlotte temple&quot; has been rediscovered and published in a scholarly press edition. was this reclamation of charlotte really necessary? in the past twenty years feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati. authors such as anne plumptre frances burney aphra behn sarah fielding and charlotte lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives. feminist scholar cathy davidson has taken charlotte temple in hand and aims to join rowson to the above list of rediscoveries. unfortunately rowson does not warrant such treatment. rowson has a flat humorless approach to the fallen woman story. unlike burney's &quot;evelina&quot; or &quot;camilla&quot; rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity. her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates. in many of the fallen women stories authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures. rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel. she seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in england and america it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel so rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed. rowson does not criticize men within the novel. she does not censure montraville for taking charlotte as his mistress impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman. when he believes that charlotte has becomes his best friend's mistress he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him. he aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting &quot;dishonorable&quot; against her. yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her she would not have been reduced to a penniless pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter. he never takes responsibility for his role in charlotte's downfall. rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with montraville but she fails to take it. instead rowson places the blame for charlotte's ruin on the women within the novel. when charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men. madame du pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose miss la rue. madame du pont sets charlotte's downfall in action. rowson does not punish the ignorant madame du pont by killing her she ends up an hysterical mess after the montraville/charlotte &quot;elopement.&quot; miss la rue the woman who pushes charlotte into the arms of montraville must be punished for being a promiscuous woman. she ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food. she ends up dying painfully as rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women. why would modern readers want to read this? i do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel. at 125 pages it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace. no character has any shadings. there are no subplots to divert the attention from the static charlotte. rowson does nothing to keep our interest. unfortunately rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first american woman to have a best-selling novel. that accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia but it does not make for engaging reading ",negative

" i purchased this book at walmart which rarely carries books regarding shambala or any other eastern ideology. it was cheap and on the clearance rack. i should have know better. when i realized this was part three in a series i decided to read the first two books the celestine prophecy and the tenth insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one. after borrowing and reading the first two i realized what a sham this series truly is. first i realize they are supposed to be fictional. however when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate. additionally when usurping a mythical name such as shambala one should know what the actual mythology entails instead of making up one's own notion of what is involed. shambala is not the same as shangri-la. shangri-la was a fictional community in a book written in early 20th century western culture. shambala is an ancient eastern mythical kingdom that is in no way similar to the fictional place in redfield's imagination. also beware of writers who combine religions and mythologies. as joseph campbell said many times in his lectures and books they all contain the truth as seen by different cultures but they must never be mixed together. it just doesn't work ",negative

" i have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market. edain mccoy who has written some wonderful new age material strikes an off-putting note in this one. the spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements. in several of her spreads she conveys that a card's placement at a certain point in the spread may or may not mean some karmic element at play. the whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define. therefore when a card may or may not mean something that interpretation could significantly change on whether you may or may not interpret it that way leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card's meaning. tarot cards are intuitive not rational and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity it is difficult to have it both ways and i found working with these spreads difficult. imagine doing a celtic cross reading and the first position may or may not be the root of the issue. these spreads speak very clearly to the author but not so to the reader. i rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into karma and past lives but the explanations are too ambiguous.

" normally i like the entire female power thing but frankly the this is wrong or evil part of that storyline is really old. in an era where girls do try out for and get placed on boys teams these issues seem outdated. likewise rules were recently changed in indiana (not even slightly a liberal state) that says any pageant receiving state funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sex or gender. i know this book is from 1999 but we are living in a conservative backlash politically and this is still happening changes are happening. overall i felt the book had a very negative view of the gender roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be different. even the disempowered girl who creates the initial problems with her magic is empowered through a pageant and her cooking. how much more gender role enforcement can we have? really with a strong female lead shouldn't a buffy universe story do better than this? in general the feel of the relationships and lingo between the main characters was fine but not particularly outstanding ",negative
" while i think the basics of the book are good i don't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the best option. i did much better on the south beach diet where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods. fat is what makes us feel satisfied. after years of trying to diet by limiting fat it was a revelation to me i could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived. an omelette made of egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary. secondly many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low-fat. i just noticed this week that cool whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it's top ingredients. this can't be better for you than actual cream. i also prefer the book french woman don't get fat which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good natural food when it's in season. the pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle. i feel that the g.i diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before. i think this book is about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated. it certainly can help get people on the right track but i think there are better books available.

" i loved the first carole matthews novel i read for better or worse and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. it kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight but only because i didnt' have anything else to do. i am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane. i totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. there were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. to me matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. i think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage. if you want to read something good pick up a jane green novel instead.

" i purchased this book several months ago. during that time i've tried several of the recipes - the french lentil soup is very good. the chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing. the chili was so-so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste. the recipe for mushroom french lentil and chestnut ragu says to see glossary for the chestnuts but there's nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts. it wasn't until i read another recipe (smoky chestnut and sweet potato soup) that chestnuts were discussed. the mediterranean salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster. far too much red onion (which my guests mostly picked out). although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare. as someone who works full time a 20-ingredient recipe holds very little allure no matter how good it sounds. i had trouble finding some of the ingredients. for example the author specifies several different types of squash which i haven't been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer's markets. the book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents. if you're looking for a specific recipe you'll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient. the author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop ",negative

" i have enjoyed many of mark's novels (do you know that i love you is my favorite of the bunch) all the time recognizing his severe limitations as a writer. every character in every roeder novel speaks with the same voice--all of them and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen characters his narrative passages invariably sound as if they were written by someone decades older. there is frequent repetition and redudancy; characters never say anything once if they can say it two or three or four times (though he has definitely improved since his mediocre first novel ancient prejudice which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing teen suicide). his characters always (and i mean always) mate for life which is a beautiful romantic ideal but ultimately can get tiresome (gay teens are no different from straight ones in their need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment). all that said at his best (dykwik a better life keeper of secrets) mark roeder writes a compelling and often un-put-downable story. but in outfield menace the bad most definitely outweighs the good. did mr. roeder do any research into the time period??? the fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel (if only as an educational experience for contemporary teens who don't realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time) but if you want to set a novel in the fifties don't have a lead male character with a ponytail. no one but no one wore a pony tail in the fifties (and certainly not in a small midwest town). don't have characters use anachronisms like fifteen minutes of fame. and most of all don't have characters behave and think in anachronistic wasys. mark roeder illustrates the dangers of self publishing. he has apparently made a name for himself (and some money i'd guess) and i must confess i've bought his novels (glutton for coming out stories that i am) but no legitimate house would publish his novels at least not without major editing and rewriting something that a self published author (especially one with an apparently inflated self image) goes without. there has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction this past year or two. major publishers have put out such superb young adult novels as totally joe m or f? the hookup artist rainbow road boy girl boy. read them if only to see how these truly outstanding (and published by legit houses) novels could teach mark roeder a thing or two. if you must read roeder then stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep. memo to roeder: if you want to write about a time you don't know about do your research ",negative

" i am an elementary school teacher previewing this book in order to find a developmentally appropriate text for a study of religion. i am not religious and i strive to take a learner's stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study that i present to my students. betsy and guilio maestro have written other fabulous books on several topics; books that i have made available to my students for their research because they were accurate and presented without bias. this particular work unfortunately is neither. their gesture was genuine and gracious an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote. no deity need take offense; all were included in the pantheon of possibilities. it is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and finally a statement of belief by the authors. though written as an overview of many of the world religions this book culminates in a doctrinal statement of the confusing theology of religious pluralism the view that no religion is objectively truer than any other. one point ought to be obvious though: everything can't be true. the religions mentioned are like oil and water; they can't mix because they represent opposite and competing concepts. an appeal to their similarities doesn't help. we would never say aspirin and arsenic are basically the same just because they both come in tablet form. it's the differences that are critical. that's true in all areas of life especially the spiritual. if god exists he's either personal or not personal. he can't be both. if god is merely a cosmic energy why ask his blessing? he can't hear or respond. if he's a person then he's someone not everyone. this book is not as much a story of religions as it is a recipe for religious stew ",negative

" this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths and underlying the story are indeed echoes sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted of ancient myths. god is allegorized as gabalawi the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs. the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters. the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel; the second that of moses and pharaoh; the third that of jesus; the fourth that of muhammad. then there is a fifth story in which the central figure a `magician' is presumably a scientist. he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi `who had been easier to kill than to see'. it makes no difference: the scientist who has invented a weapon of great destructive power is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever though they remain hopeful that one day `magic' will put an end to their suffering. subtle the book is not either in content or in style; and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive. the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another. a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent. they mostly `shout' `scream' `shriek' `yell' `cry' or `sneer' which becomes rather tiresome. the literary quality of this novel is i think greatly inferior to mahfouz's rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature. but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written: it has been banned in egypt; its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author's life.

" whether you're planning to read through crowley's book of thoth for the first time or if you think you know every little thing crowley was getting at with it this book is going to be equally useless to you. several of crowley's diagrams from the book of thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly but sadly that's the only good thing about this book. the book is filled with a lot of fluff. duquette tells many useless anecdotes of crowley's and harris' lives and constantly excuses and defends crowley's character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper. duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found crowley's works so perhaps its some sort of atonement. but the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with crowley's character. through out the book of thoth crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems. having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid. unfortunately duquette doesn't do this. his background information is base and scarce. he does spend some time explaining about thelema and kabbalah but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this duquette doesn't give nearly enough information to understand crowley's works and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere. as for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on crowley's work duquette outright fails. at times it seems as if duquette doesn't even understand crowley or the book of thoth and the associated tarot deck. i don't think the man even understands tarot in general (and duquette's own tarot deck is evidence of this too). at his best duquette only manages to rephrase what crowley had to say in the book of thoth. typically though a lot of what crowley was getting at is complete lost in duquette's work a lot of it no doubt because duquette never really understood crowley at anything but a very base level. reading through the book of thoth there are a few ways in which duquette could have made his book better. crowley's phonetic translation of the i ching doesn't follow the current standard and sometimes the differences are confusing especially if the reader is not already familiar with the i ching. a key showing crowley's translation and the standard translation would've been helpful. likewise crowley rarely wrote on astrology despite astrology being alluded to many times through the book of thoth and what he did write is hard to find. a chapter explaining crowley's views on astrology would've been great. if that wasn't possible then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what crowley was working with would have been helpful. however duquette's solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read. duquette's book isn't useful as a reference to crowley's work. duquette doesn't seem to understand crowley most of the time and fails to adequatley explain crowley's ideas. besides some new-agey nonsense like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays duquette doesn't offer any new ideas or insights into crowley's work. except for a few nice diagrams (which are common enough and easy to find) there isn't anything worthwhile contained in this book. at least not anything you won't get out of reading crowley's book of thoth ",negative

" the burning was a big letdown after reading bentley little's masterful book dispatch. i seriously considered that this book might be written by someone else while bentley was ill and couldn't write. who knows. i love this guy and can't tell you how disappointed i was. while one of the top 5 horror writers working today bentley little seems to be hit or miss with his stories. i simply just did not enjoy reading this new release. it seemed that he was throwing way too much random horror at the reader and hoping some of it would stick. and with everything he was trying to do none of it - not one moment - was scary! shadow creatures performing random oral sex creeping fungus talking voices in the microwave deformed goblins peering in windows skeletons climbing out of mud pits tunnels filled with moving corpses and a runaway ghost train crashing into the white house was just too silly. it reminded me of his previous work the return another disappointment containing silly bizarre and unrealistic situations. the scenes of horror during the first third of the book were described during the daytime hours and lost its scare value suspense and atmospheric quality. the book had many problems that pulled me out of the story. one of those problems was how ridiculous it was that the police would allow a field trip to a tunnel of bodies that had just been discovered earlier that same day. bentley needs to do what he does best which is to come up with a gimmick focus everything on that single idea and continue to build suspense around it using his original and obsessed style of storytelling. it worked with the store the association the policy and dispatch just to name a few. let's hope he gets back on track with his next book.

" i have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience. i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity. it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems. i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary. it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything.

" the best book on the history of world war ii that i've read in a long time. the title has three meanings: 1. it can refer to the gunner at the back of a bomber. the brits called these people 'rear gunners.' the yanks used the term 'tail gunner.' it's the most dangerous position in the plane. 2. the last plane in the formation. this was more true in the american combat box than in british usage. this position is difficult to hold because it is at the end of a string and every move by the lead ship propagates irregularily through the formation. it is also more dangerous as enemy fighters can attack this ship more easily since there aren't so many guns pointing that direction. 3. it can refer to the bombing missions near the end of the war. this splendid book covers all three of these meanings. in addition it does an excellent job of discussing the power and importance of air power in the defeat of germany ",positive
" *** refers to cd recording **** after picking up and putting down the book countless times i finally listened to this on cd. the time and attention i didn't have for the print version came easily for the audio recording. guiness is an engaging and enthusisatic speaker in full command of his subject matter. he draws on foundational christian truths historic and contemporary references anecdotes and a solid business acumen. he routinely distinguishes between what something is and is not (eg; vocation calling surrender) in unequivocal terms. also he consistently makes the point that the main reason for our existence is to glorify god; everything else in his presentation simply ties-back to this truth. he explains how we get distracted how others have and how we can correct our path again providing examples. and unlike the christianity lite trend in america that often promotes wealth without work or responsibility guinness is explicit about the sacrifice inherent in a christian life using for example the lives of leonidas st. francis and bonhoeffer. he also speaks of the joys of a truly god-centered life. i recommend the call to anyone who is listening for their own call. it will help you distinguish between a calling and wish-fulfillment/fantasy acquaint you with others who have heard their call and inspire you to act. if you've already heard and responded to your call you'll recognize guinness as a fellow traveler. this 3-hour presentation was taped live at highland park presbyterian church in dallas tx usa. the recording includes 3 audience q&a sessions of about 10 minutes each. these were as informative as the main presentation often reflecting the very questions i had while listening. recording was produced by wpublishinggroup.com in nashville tn usa ",positive

" i've been very critical of the fiction work of john grisham in recent years and have said many times that he needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories more interesting. well he has taken time off of writing novels to write this interesting if not spectacular non-fiction work of the trials and tribulations of ronald williamson a former minor league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to death row. i won't go into the details of williamson's ordeal but i will say that grisham has written a pretty cut-and-dried book that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers but is still interesting nonetheless. he does a good job giving the details of ron's case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and ron suffered from growing mental issues. grisham didn't even think about writing ron's story until after ron passed away so there are no interviews to draw upon but he does a decent job of tying it all together. i will also say that although he is anti-death penalty he doesn't hammer that opinion at you. he lets the story itself do the talking. i'm actually interested in how this book will impact the quality of grisham's next novel as he'll have actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time. hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like the firm or a time to kill not dreck like the king of torts ",positive

" a quick search in amazon books under the name benjamin franklin comes up with 2403 matches. based upon that criteria many people would say that everything that could be said or that needs to be said about ben franklin has been said. those people would be emphatically wrong as has been proven by author and historian h.w. brands in his work on franklin the first american: the life and times of benjamin franklin. brands expertly brings this pivotal figure in american history back to life once more in this book which was a pulitzer finalist in 2002. this book is not only about franklin but its pages are dotted with an unbelievable cast of secondary characters. brands brings the friends and acquaintances of franklin to life ranging from cotton mather to sir isaac newton. the book also spans the life of franklin from his humble beginnings in boston to world acclaim as one of the pivotal architects of american society and government. i believe this is the finest biography written on franklin since van doren's pulitzer prize winner of some seventy years ago. of course a book about franklin would be incomplete without also being about the creation and formation of america as the two are intricately attached. but brands' work here is all inclusive giving us not only the politics of franklin but his creative genius business sense and so much more we've grown to appreciate about this senior statesman in american history. i have no idea how many biographies i have read about benjamin franklin but this is definitely one of the best ever. h.w. brands has a wonderful writing style with flowing narrative meticulous detail and is one of the few franklin biographers who successfully point the reader to franklin's human side rather than keeping the attention on his mythical status. monty rainey www.juntosociety.co ",positive

" while i am only a high school sophmore and i don't have a *real* job this book has been very helpful in deciding what to shoot for doing. i've heard people call this book too vague but they can't tell you exactly what to do; it doesn't work that way. once you get through the personality quiz portion the author gives a somewhat detailed description of your specific personality type (i for example am and enfp) and throws in suggestions in the description and also give a modest list of other possibilities. i'll admit it was a bit vauger than i had hoped but it gives you plenty of room to move around and a great place to start. i'm lucky i found this book when i did (and not 3-4 years into college) because i found some satisfying career options that i would not normally have chosen for myself and they are on the opposite end of the spectrum from what i was previously considering. (looking at this run-on sentence you will be relieved to know that none of my choices are to be an english teacher) overall this was a good book. there was a lot of filler describing the different personality characteristics that i found redundant only because i have gone over this in school a couple times. however if you are unfamiliar with this territory the explanations will be quite helpful ",positive

" the ny times book review linked this novel to the aftermath of 9-11 but that may have more to do with the preoccupation of new yorkers than with the story powers wrote. while he does refer to 9-11 early on this book concerns environmentalism and species conservation versus wrong-headed economic development in the great plains at the western edge of the midwestern farming belt. it is about the struggle not to loose even more economic ground relative to the rest of america in a region that is being slowly drained of its population due to the changing scale of agricultural operations. but since it is a richard powers novel it is also about much more: neuro-physiology brain function as reflected in behavior and personality the devotion of a 30ish sister to her less-able younger brother her sexual relations with two very different men and a nationally-known writer (clearly modeled on oliver sachs) who has a late mid-life crisis. it is about love devotion and doing as much of the right thing as one can do. it involves escape and return. clearly powers should not be considered a regional writer. his books have been set entirely or partly in brooklyn manhattan philadelphia l. a. the pacific northwest and the continent of europe. but several books by powers are set in the midwest where he is based. readers who know something of the areas in which those stories are set will gain an extra measure of appreciation for the skillful way powers incorporates subtle regional characteristics into these novels. as others have said this is probably not the best novel this writer has given us although it is quite carefully plotted and full of the marvelous insights we have come to expect from him. i prefer the goldbug variations three farmers on their way to a dance and despite my own musical illiteracy in the time of our singing. but even when powers is not quite at his best he writes a better book than most novelists ever manage ever to produce. read enjoy learn ",positive
" i must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were. heisenberg's uncertainty principle was just an equation i learned. hawking made it seem like common sense. hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times (and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points! just in case you missed them!) but all-in-all this was a quite readable account of what's presently known about cosmology. i use the term presently guardedly as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter (it exists!) but from now on when there are new findings in physics i want hawking to explain them to me because i feel like then i might understand them. that's why you should read this book. the reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life and would rather read about global warming or darfur or something a bit more topical and practical. this was still a hard read and i feel like i grasped maybe 80% of it. for you to decide but for a former engineering student this was something i wish i had read when i was taking physics ",positive

" college stoner cult following aside hunter s. thompson's journalistic prowess was a vital national resource up until he left us last february. thompson was one of those brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his subject material counjouring hilarious allegories where the average journalist would already have soiled himself in disillusionment. on the campaign trail should be required reading for all those who hold a less skeptical view of american politics than say the average wwe heavyweight title match for a truly sane person should be no more shocked to hear of a politician lying or cheating to increase his presidential hopes than when the undertaker strikes his opponent with a steel chair when the referee turns his back. hunter has long since traveled through this looking glass -- although he can at times be found expressing nostalagia for the wide-eyed optimism of the 60s -- but the result is not nearly as depressing as it is hilarious. the image of thompson infiltrating the nixon youth at the rnc and yelling obscenities and death threats at rival journalist john chancellor's press box while surrounded by hundreds of kids chanting four more years! was one of the funniest any book has offered me in a while. how does the cliche go -- the more things change the more they stay the same? after the thorough spanking of george mcgovern at the hands of richard nixon hst credits the most staggering blow to mcgovern's presidential hopes to a media crisis involving his vice-presidential nominee thomas eagleton. just days after eagleton was named as mcgovern's running mate two democratic campaign managers received phone calls revealing that eagleton had gone through intensive psychiatric treatment on three separate occasions. as the story spread like wildfire throughout the press mcgovern's presidential hopes were dealt a blow from which they would never recover. since then we've seen willie horton and the swift boat veterans come out to haunt their respective candidates and one is inclined to wonder who the democratic mascot will be for the 2008 race. perhaps a mentally disabled child whose tricycle was crushed by the car of hillary clinton? a dominican prostitute who gave joe biden the clap? but i digress. i give on the campaign trail 4 out of 5 stars because the book like presidential campaigns themselves can at times seem uneventful. thompson addresses this from time to time wondering aloud what it was that made him want to cover politics in the first place before remembering that the rush one feels from being a part of a winning political team is nearly identical to that of a junkie getting that long-needed fix. other parts of the book will only make sense to the more hardcore followers of politics. for instance hst's extensive interview with campaign manager rick stearns where stearns explains the intricacies of acquiring state delegates reads like hieroglyphics to me.

" bob quinn is definitely one of the most profound writers on change in this era. but his work is not for the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start change initiatives in the place we'd least like to go -- inside ourselves. i found this an incredibly powerful book. i've used sections of it with my change management classes for several years and i know it has a tremendous impact on students who like most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change always needs to start with the other guy. if you want a simple formula for change don't buy this book. although it is full of practical actionable ideas change the world addresses change at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on what they stand for. it's a very difficult but rewarding assignment ",positive

" this book is not about all people. it is about gifted (in this case that means sensitive) children that are misused to feed their parents narcissism. most children are not that sensitive and hence not suseptible to that specific abuse. it is possible to be gifted and not be sensitive but those traits do trend together. i agree that reading this book is an emotional experience for those former children but that is a necessary part of the healing process. this book pioneered the idea examine this from the child's perspective and any subsequent critics need to consider this. i heartily recommend this book for those that have been affected and the others should give their copy to the library grateful not to have needed it ",positive

" gibbon's decline and fall is without a doubt one of the most well-written and truly comprehensive historical works concerning the roman empire. from the military maneuvers of the northern legions to the intrigues of the imperial court gibbon showcases the history of rome as it unfolded--often relying on the eyewitness testimony of contemporary writers to give readers a sense of the passions and policies of the time. there are a few minute problems--or rather gaps--in gibbon's work but given that he originally published in the late 1700's we can excuse his lack of complete information. overall an excellent read and a great history of such an important subject ",positive

" tina dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case which encompasses motherhood mental illness child abuse and matricide. dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion. that in and of itself is impressive because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the otherget caught up in emotion and appear unable to really present all sides of the story. lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention. it is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them but also tragically failed their mother.

" with every grisham book i read i get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense but to insert other elements to make this human as well. for once we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain. however this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune. however she does not know this. a lawyer is sent to find her and in the process undergoes a fundamental change of his own. this story takes place in washington maryland west virginia and the rain forests along the brazilian-bolivian border. in typical grisham fashion he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes. you can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions. you can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight. you can envision the rainforest and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of nate o'riley. this is yet another grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue. the pages literally turn themselves. do not start this novel before going to bed or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down.

" this book styron's finest is about redemption. heralded by the epigraph from john donne the intricately structured tale with its marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that it's impossible to put down. but it's also to styron's great credit that the novel's theme redemption through confrontation with death and violence is reflected through its feverish style. there are not many books in the postwar era and none in the united states that have such a non-moralistic but intensely moral character and impact. echoes of the greek tragedians (several times evoked in the text) and of dostoyevski abound. finally the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate character a philosophical italian small-town cop named luigi elevates the moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers don't even seem to understand let alone approach. it's a shame that styron has not received the nobel prize yet ",positive
" i read the good doctor's book eat to live and then bought china study which he talks a lot about in this book. then i bought this book being curious after reading a few other books on fasting and this book wins hands down though i do feel he's being overly cautious about doing long fasts of more than 5 days without medical supervision to protect himself as people have been doing long fasts for centuries without medical supervision and doing just fine and since finding a doctor in even a large community is rare indeed one is left to do this on their own. being a vegetarian for more than 37 years i became an almost 100% vegan after reading eat to live and have to say that i feel great with more energy and even started reducing anti-depression med i've been taking for severe depression. yesterday i took my last pill! all week i've been emptying my refrigerator in order to start my water fast tomorow. and reducing my one cup of coffee in the norning to none because i remember clerly that awful caffiene withdrawl healache i'm going to do 10 days and hoping for 14. i've done 3 day fast before and one 5 day and that was great. yes there are some flaws in both books and i wish the good doctor would have made use of a good editor as it's not as professionally written as it could be and the recipes in eat to live are atrocious with too much canned foods and not healthy organic foods but i'll forgive him because he got me on the china study which changed my life and his studies and own experience helping people get well are good and inspiring. why am i going on a 10 day detox water diet? i read randall fitxgerald's one hundred year lie and that was the catalyst that pulled it all together for me. a detox fast absolutely necessary after my years on earth and after too many years on anti-depressants i'm keeping dr. fuhrman's fasting book close by during the next 10 hopefully 14 days for support and encouragement. i did make the mistake of telling my coworkers that i was starting a 10 day fast though the good doctor warned me not to. the comments from them were typical i suppose knowing their health or lack of but i held my tongue. those comments are just like the stupid ones some of the reviewers of dr. fuhnman's books make along with other nutrituion books. but i thinkof the wisest words you are responsible for your own health and think about my not being able to remember the last time i had a cold and the last flu i had in 1964 and smile. i don't intend to support the ill-begotten medical-pharmecutical industry. the last time i went to the dr. i promptly firedhim after his continued to badger me into getting manograms. and other tests i repeated that i eat well etc and he said nutrition had nothing to to do with breast cancer and i just walked out of his office forever. i'd rather read a book ",positive

" this book gives the reader a fascinating and personal look inside not just the foster care system but why they are very much so needed. young dave's life was very likely saved by being taken from his mother's home and placed into foster care. but this book makes it clear that despite this positive change in is life it certainly didn't mean everything was happily ever after. dave then struggled with issues ranging from not knowing some of the mere basics that other twelve years olds know by that age ranging from as simple as how to take a proper bath to how to behave with proper manners. it also gives you a good look at the struggle these hard working foster homes and parents go through. they deal day in and day out with children coming from troubled homes and these foster homes are in such high demand that they end up cramped to the brim. i think many of us myself included are unaware of just what a struggle it is for both the foster children and the foster parents as well as how much we need to support these people. they are dedicating themselves to a truly needed and wonderful cause. thanks again dave for having the courage to share your beautiful story of heartache and triumph with us ",positive

" i expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts - too-technical proofs homework questions irrelevant to the material insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are. this book really surprised me because it wasn't mathy at all. it doesn't just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand - it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts which means you only need common sense not an intensive mathematical background to get everything. the examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts. each easily and naturally leads to the next. if there's anything not thoroughly elaborated they were sure to cover it in the homework questions by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems. homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well-rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them not just how to plug numbers into some formula. if anything i'd say this book errs on the side of caution in that in some sections it could pick up the pace a little. but then again you could always just skip the easier parts ",positive

" theodore b. taylor the physicist who was the subject of this book died in 2004 but not before he had completed his spiritual journey from nuclear bomb maker to nuclear protester. even though the text of this book originally appeared in the new yorker in 1973 taylor was still driven to publish his own works on the dangers of nuclear proliferation. mcphee has a very understated style (just the facts ma'am) but this book is still the most frightening i've ever read. i can't decide whether i would want him to write a sequel because the threat of a nuclear bomb explosion is even greater today than it was in 1973. just ask yourself the following questions: is there more plutonium available to terrorists in 2006 than there was in 1973? yes. do more nations have nuclear capability? yes. can a nuclear bomb be built that is even smaller and more efficient than its 1973 counterpart? yes. are the instructions for building a nuclear device more readily available than they were in 1973? yes. do some people hate america even more than they did in 1973? decide this one for yourself. john mcphee staff writer for the new yorker and pulitzer-prize-winning author of twenty-seven books on subjects as various as oranges and the merchant marine has written a nuclear explosion of a book in the curve of binding energy. it's one of those books that is even more relevant now than when it was written. essentially it's a blueprint of how to build a nuclear device using materials at hand along with a chunk of rather easily stolen u-235 or plutonium. theodore b. taylor himself the creator of smaller more efficient nuclear bombs tells us where to steal the plutonium how to assemble a bomb even gives hints on where to plant it--one of the eeriest parts of this book has taylor and mcphee exploring the now-vanished towers of the world trade center trying to pick the spot where a nuclear device could do the most damage. the curve of binding energy is a must read for every man jack and paper-pusher in the department of homeland security not to mention both houses of congress. i imagine the first reaction of many congresspersons would be to ban this book but it's way too late for that my friend.

" these are all short stories some very short; that's what he wrote. i remember reading a number of these (the science fiction ones mostly) in translation years ago. rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting. as a collection of all his fictions some of the items are a bit repetitive; the variations on the knife fight theme for instance. but the range of his imagination is fascinating particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity: a lot of it presages the information-based world of today which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind. perhaps the link to the internet is one reason borges seems to have a bit of a following these days among technophiles. is not the web exactly borges' book of sand - a place that absorbs us with fascinating and unique pages of information but when we turn to find them again we never can? and how long will it be before an imagined orbis tertius engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think we can rely on (one might suggest it's already happened - look up tatooine for instance...) what exactly is information when it's just a bunch of ones and zeros - everything's already been written in the library of babel after all! the other fascinating thread to me was the influence of arabic and muslim themes; i'd never caught that before but this collection includes a number of stories with an arab perspective. perhaps this is a well-known part of spanish heritage; in any case it was certainly interesting getting to know borges through this collection from the knife fights to the arabian courts to the immortals - not everything was great but enough great stuff to be really worth spending some time with ",positive

" i really like this series of books that range from this storage one to bathrooms family houses etc... but i am giving this book a 4 because it shows alot of houses that seem to be beyond the means of most people that i know around my area. this book also likes to tell you to build storage in every little crack/space that does not currently have something useful going for it. i am giving it 4 stars because it does inform you of all of the different types of devices that are currently (as of the book being published) available to help you make storage possible in nooks and crannies. it also gives you ideas and suggestions about how you can make more use out of the storage that you already have by redesigning the shelving to make it more attractive also. try not to read it all at once though because i started to gloss over stuff just to get to the end of the book. take it a step at a time and it will be a great start for you ",positive
" i read an interview with mr. vollman i think a couple years ago i can't quote directly but he said he thought that prostitutes were very spiritual people. they save marriages they provide comfort to the loneliest most desperate among us. in practically the same breath he observed that they spread disease and sometimes rob their johns. that kind of duality is at the heart of much of vollman's writing. on the surface whores for gloria is one desperate delusional man so eager for even the illusion of relatedness that he attempts to recreate gloria with bits and pieces of other prostitutes. it isn't fully clear if gloria herself was ever real but regardless it is now a quest to fill that void collage style with physical samples such as hair clippings as well as emotional artifacts. the most poignant scene may be the protagonist hiring a prostitute and wanting nothing more than to hear happy childhood memories. the prostitute complies as best she can but story after story the narratives veer into disturbing material. the hardest thing for the human to do is to hold opposite opinions about one thing at the same time. the more intelligent and observant one is the more painfully aware of the absurdity of this task the more painfully aware of the mental contortions necessary to maintain the illusion of meaning. this is where the magic lies in true artistc genius such as a thelonius monk solo or in this case vollman's writing. i've never read anything that better communicates simultaneous beauty and ugliness. and no better forum than gutter sex which vollman renders both repulsive and compelling. and he doesn't do it by being overly clever. he does it through the chaos of brute honesty. whatever compositional gymnastics go into the writing the end product is very readable and deceptively simple ",positive

" there is little more i can contribute to this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work. gustave flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected madame bovary with care. he worked on the novel for nearly six years during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. the result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty. madame bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine emma bovary as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth. she exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle. flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal. in perfect contrast to emma flaubert introduces charles bovary a proto-typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer. soon after their wedding emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling charles and yearns for a romantic interlude. flaubert represents the absolute clich of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding unimpressive and unnoticed middle-class man. flaubert brings all facets of human personas full-circle with the shy well-mannered and well-liked young man-next-door leon. with a slow-blossoming relationship with emma leon leaves for paris to study law. upon his return--and with a little experience--the two become lovers. flaubert's portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore. thereafter the degeneracy of emma's lifestyle is evident and she is brought to the brink of destruction. in madame bovary gustave flaubert gives us a vivid and life-like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small-town people living in france during the mid-nineteenth-century. flaubert's descriptions are detailed and beautiful--and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing. opening with first-person narration that sometimes shifts to third-person has earned gustave flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century ",positive
" this book is a very good study into what happen to the lost ten tribes of israel. mr. capt did a great job in back tracking by using the clay tablets that were found in assyria which list the tribes by the name which was used by the assyrians which is called the house of omri. this book is very in depth and very informative. i also noticed a person left one star because mr. capt did say anything about the jews. of course the jew's wouldn't be metioned they weren't taken into exile until 586 bce and that was by babylonia and not assyria. when reading about the ten tribes people need to know that the ten tribes were not jews. over all i give five stars and it is a must have for a historian or an avid bible reader intrested in research ",positive

" sacred pathways is easy to read plain balanced and straightforward. the book surveys 9 different spirituality types. for each type it identifies scripture historical characters styles of worship and dangers. the book contains an evaluation tool to help the reader identify his or her personal spiritual personality. as with any survey tool this book does not go deeply enough into any particular spiritual practice. it doesn't need to. what it offers is an excellent service to the christian community. for those who are trapped in a church that worships in a style predominately different from the their own this book offers the knowledge that the reader is not alone. there are others out there that worship in the same way. for those who believe that all true worship looks like their style of worship this book offers a broader view of the christian landscape. i gave this book 5 stars because it could have a potentially life changing impact on those who have lived in a closed environment.

" over 20 years after it was published the story of the israeli attempt to eradicate massive and repeated terrorist attacks emanating from the plo (bubba's/jacques/un's buddy yasser) in lebanon is no less important. interestingly lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of syrian occupation. they have gone from the vegan dictator hafez assad murdering opponents and journalists to the syrian optometrist dictator murdering opponents and journalists (another killed last week 7/2005). in this review i will attempt to explain the story the left-wing/doves reporter's views (and on so many levels his mistakes) and most importantly to americans who love and support israel the correlation between israel's actions and our war on terror. first to the journalists the main one being the left wing newspaper haraatz ze'ev schiff. as the brilliant reviewer givbatam3 points out nearby mr. schiff is a member of the israeli left/dove/peace now group. this coalition consists of myopic people (with all due respect) that don't seem to understand good and evil. just as our great president bush was criticized for denouncing the axis of evil (he forgot to mention syria and the house of saud) these doves conveniently choose to ignore the problems with cooperating with our/their enemies. this is what lead to the fraudulent oslo accords and the creation of the terrorist supporting palestinian authority. it is this authority that unleashed a wave of terror on israel immediately after clinton helped the murderer arafat receive a nobel peace prize. fittingly arafat walked away from the clinton/barak plan in 2000 which would have created a palestinian state which to this day (7.8.05) does not exist despite the charade of the road map. the authors accuse prime minister sharon of illegally leading israel into the war in lebanon. most of the books i've read about israel seem to have been written by journalists out to discredit sharon. he seems to be the donald rumsfeld of israel. i don't live there so it is impossible for me to get a read on the situation but he was democratically elected so most of the voters must disagree with the left's assessment of mr. sharon (yes i know his disengagement is an illegal abomination more on that later. wear orange to support the settlers.) on page 39 mr. ze'ev describes sharon as a cynical headstrong executor who regarded the idf as his personal tool for obtaining sweeping achievements-and not necessarily defensive ones-and a minister prepared to stake the national interest on his struggle for power. those would prove to be the kindest words he would have for mr. sharon. on page 58 he accuses sharon of implementing a quasi-coup d'etat. and on and on it goes. the author also accuses sharon of duping the american government details forthcoming. later on we learn of the courageous freedom fighter (my emphasis) arafat's decision to deploy all palestinians including 12 year old boys to kill israelis. of course to this day the pa affiliated fatah and other groups use children to murder israeli civilians (the best non-child attack recently was the palestinian woman who was granted permission to receive medical care in israel who tried to kill innocent israeli doctors/nurses using bomber pants. great video of her discovering the bomb wouldn't activate however us msm {mainstream media} other than fox refused to air it.) on page 92 we learn of arafat crony and current pa leader abu mazen's (the same oslo and road map violating terrorist supporting/enabling holocaust denying chain-smoking mazen that gw brazenly brought to the white house) recommendation to target specific ethnic types of jews for murder. throughout the story if indeed the cabinet was mislead we learn that this deception had negative military preparedness consequences. specifically a failure to call up the reserves. to his credit and unlike journalists robert fisk (pity the nation) and thomas friedman (ny times from lebanon to jerusalem) mr. schiff reminds us of the level of terror practiced by ray-ban wayfarer wearing arafat even inside his own plo. on page 147 we learn of palestinians killing palestinians that were given the chance to evacuate an area prior to idf action. in this episode three children were gunned down in front of their father. on page 149 the authors engage in a disgusting bit of analysis about the minds of idf members. in discussing a particularly brutal phase of the operation the author's ask was it perhaps fueled by an even deeper sense of vengeance for all the harm and hatred that the jews had suffered at the hands of others over the centuries? and further how would the grandparents of these boys have reacted to the scene of mayhem...? are you kidding me?? these members of the citizen army were probably quite sick of repeated murders of innocent israeli citizens and committed to seeing their country living in peace. meanwhile the un the left/doves the media and others seemed to downplay or turn a blind eye to arafat's involvement in the many terrorist attacks conducted by the plo prior to the lebanon operation. in my humble view something had to be done. prime minister begin agreed with sharon's initial plan on eliminating the terrorists in beirut. page 152 features more america bashing culminating in an accusation that the us was an israeli dupe. the story of the military operation is detailed completely. and no discussion of the lebanon operation would be complete without mentioning the incidents in the refugee camps in sabrit and shatilla. i'll leave it for the reader to decide on this operation but in short israel relied on their allies in lebanon to rid the camps of terrorists. most assuredly after the palestinians brought havoc to these people they wanted revenge. the result: some civilian deaths to go along with the clean up operation and a rebuke of several israeli figures including prime minister sharon. folks war is not pretty and the us faced similar choices in partnering with the northern alliance in afghanistan. many to this day say that is why we allegedly lost bin laden in tora bora instead of adequately deploying our troops on the pakistan border. general tommy franks says this would not have been possible and i believe him more than the kerry/kedwards crowd. our ally pakistan would not have tolerated a us presence given that they were one of only three governments with relations with the taliban. as for the author's attempts to rid israeli society of prime minister sharon it didn't work. he forcefully fought the charges emanating from the investigation into the lebanon operation. after yasser walked all over clinton in barak in 2000 and launched/restarted the intifada israel voted for arik and his platform of not negotiating with arafat. sadly no tragically he is haphazardly implementing his disengagement plan. six weeks prior to its start it appears the plan is not well thought out and polls show that israelis are increasingly against it. moreover turning land over to terrorist supporting mazen will embolden those that seek israel's destruction. israel expects terror gangs of hamas islamic jihad and mazen's own fatah to immediately set up shop in the west bank and begin terror operations. so looking back mr. schiff and ya'ari who was right? terror coddling doves such as rabin (who at least acknowledged the danger in trusting arafat) and peres or likud hawks such as sharon (and netanyahu)? let the reader decide. i know who i would trust with my security: likud members sharon and netanyahu.

" a refreshing look on software development and the many pitfalls you need to avoid. this book should be read by everybody involved in any software project but the simplest. in my opinion a standard work. nevertheless it needs to be handled with care. during ages sw development managers have tried convincing their people to break out of the chaos and plan their work. this book correctly warns for the opposite effects of believing that planning solves everything. some people might however read between the lines that no planning at all is the best practice. the book confirms what i and my successful colleagues found through experience and intuition: there is an optimal point of planning upfront. less harms because you don't know where you are going more (too detailed) harms because it takes away flexibility and it slows you down significantly. new to me was the use of queuing theory to point out what we see every day: too many features under-resourcing leads to far bigger delays than human mind can ever guess.

" spend big bucks and hire the boston consulting group to help you with your strategy . . . and what do you get? hardball answers that question indirectly through sharing classic strategies for achieving competitive and economic advantage employed by bcg clients. as a result i think this book will be most appealing to mbas thinking about working for bcg and potential clients who want to get a sense of what the outcome might be like. for those who are well read in business strategy this book will be a disappointment. it focuses on very little you haven't read or thought about many times before. skip this book if you are in this category. the strategies discussed include overwhelming competitors with superior resources (frito-lay versus eagle snacks) adjusting to take advantage of what customers want more of (more variety and better delivery from wausau papers) threatening competitors' sources of profits (japanese auto makers go after the big 3's positions in minivans and suvs in north america) copy and improve on better business models (batesville casket applies automotive manufacturing techniques) encourage your competitor to retreat (attack the bottom of the market first in low margin categories and move up) refocus your business model on one set of advantages (carmax) acquire others to build your strengths while making competitors more vulnerable (masonite international) and change the nature of competition (get to low-cost sourcing earlier than competitors secure low-cost assets sooner and play the wal-mart card carefully). the overall metaphor for the book has its problems. if you play to win you are playing hardball. al dunlap (author of mean business) was a hardball guy but it didn't pay off at sunbeam. if i read past the words in the book the concept they authors are advancing is one of being unrelenting in developing a strategy that creates a virtuous cycle of ever-expanding resources and advantages while creating a vicious cycle for competitors of ever-decreasing resources and advantages. keep 'em down would have been a more accurate title for the book. you will find scant information in the book about newer types of strategies new forms of technology and new business paradigms. this book is about rock 'em sock 'em competition among the industrial giants of the world. i worked as a consultant and later as a project manager at bcg in the early 1970s and i was struck that the kinds of strategies and clients described here have changed almost not at all since then. i do think hardball better captures the classic bcg approach used in the early 1970s than any other book i have read published by the firm or its professional staff. bruce henderson would be proud of you! from my perspective i graded the book down for slight inaccuracies in places such as underplaying the legal risks in these strategies (the authors seem to think scaring off competitors with signaling is pretty risk-free) misstating some of the cases (did gm really crush ford's ability to get investment grade bonds by pushing for zero percent financing? -- it looks more like mutual suicide to me) and praising more than was due in some cases (the japanese car companies were very late to come into north america with minivans and suvs). i also thought the metaphor got in the way of the message . . . rather than enhancing it.

" this book appears on most of the 'best of' science fiction lists that various pundits and critics have put out even though it is not a very commonly known work. does it deserve such a placing? i think the answer to that depends upon what your viewpoint is about what science fiction as a form of literature is supposed to accomplish. the idea is simple enough. a new drug developed from the bacteria that causes syphilis is found to have the property of greatly increasing a person's intelligence but with major side effect - it kills the user in about nine months. the story follows one louis sacchetti a conscientious objector to a seemingly interminable war and who would already be considered to be a genius by most standards as he is transferred from a standard prison to a facility specially constructed to see what will happen to its inmates when given this drug. the story is told through the means of a journal that louis is encouraged almost forced to keep. as this idea is extremely similar to that of daniel keyes' flowers for algernon (which was later made into the movie charly) comparison is invited. flowers emphasizes the tragedy of the hero a man who struggles to find those bits of knowledge that will help not just himself but all mankind up against an unbeatable problem that of his own retreat to sub-normal intelligence again. camp concentration follows a completely different path that of the essential selfishness of the individual of nihilism of the despair of ever being able to change humanity in any meaningful way. the inmates that louis initially documents are apparently using their greatly enhanced intelligence to investigate alchemy as a means of providing immortality not for humanity in general but for themselves and the 'warden' of this prison humphrey haast. louis meanwhile seems caught up in crafting new poems and a play entitled 'auswitch a comedy'. the title is indicative of something disch does throughout this book playing with names and titles to produce another layer of meaning behind the straightforward words and is fairly effective in doing so. the tone is the primary thing here a very dark brooding atmosphere enlivened by a very wide ranging vocabulary and many references both buried and open to other works of literature (most especially dante) and scientific and psychological theories. readers who are not familiar with these references may feel a little lost at places in this book - at least i did as my breadth of knowledge in these areas is clearly more limited than disch's. but from this tone disch develops his themes of the corruption of man of his baser desires the absolute horrors of what man is capable of and where such capacity leads. as such this book is almost the complete antithesis of flowers for algernon - that is until the ending of this book. the ending of this book i felt rather drastically detracted from its overall message as it doesn't seem to fit with the rest and has a little of a deus-ex-machina feel to it. given the many layered discourse that disch presented in the rest of the book which while sometimes difficult to follow was certainly excellent writing this ending was a disappointment. while this is certainly a major entry into the dystopian side of science fiction literature whether it truly qualifies as a 'classic' will be i'm afraid very much a matter of opinion for a long time to come. but it is certainly worth reading if for nothing else than to see the darker side of genius competently presented. --- reviewed by patrick shepherd (hyperpat ",positive
" this book consists of 29 stand-alone essays beautifully written and previously published in the new england journal of medicine during the early seventies. from the first chapter: the viruses instead of being single-minded agents of disease and death now begin to look more like mobile genes...we live in a dancing matrix of viruses; they dart rather like bees from organism to organism from plant to insect to mammal to me and back again and into the sea tugging along pieces of this genome strings of genes from that transplanting grafts of dna passing around heredity as though at a great party. although there is no continuity from chapter to chapter there are consistent threads of thought as the author free associates: 1.there is a joyful attitude about science and discovery and abundant tidbits about the goings on of living things. 2.there is constant reference to the interaction symbiosis and co-operative living arrangements amongst the different species. 3.there are numerous references to the mindless activities of ants bees and termites whose activities create sophisticated developed projects without any evidence of central control. these examples are repeatedly compared to humans and their social activities with the human emphasis being on language. 4.the cell is the unit of life complete with all its intricate inner workings. the cell membrane (cell wall in plants) is the protective layer that makes this unit of life possible. in the first chapter and frequently throughout the author wants to think of the earth as a kind of organism but he can't make it work - too big too complex too many working parts without visible connections. then in the last chapter a better analogy emerges. the earth is like a huge cell and the protective atmosphere that shields us from meteors and cosmic rays is our cell membrane. this fine book is a precursor to books from the likes of carl sagan richard feynman and stephen jay gould. reading the chapters randomly is not a bad idea - each one is only four to six pages long and each gives the reader plenty to think about. amazingly after 30 years there is a little - but not much - in this book that is out of date. if you are a little rusty on biology have your oxford dictionary of science handy. first class.

" one good knight (2006) is the second fantasy novel in the tales of the five hundred kingdoms series following the fairy godmother. in the previous volume alexander and elena organized resistance to the invasion of fleurberg by a dark magician. after the death of the katschei alexander and elena were wedded becoming godmother and consort. then an order of champions was established at glass mountain with alexander as their master and elena was given charge of fleurberg in addition to her other kingdoms. in this novel princess andromeda of acadia is nineteen years old but is still considered a child by her mother queen cassiopeia and chief advisor solon adacritus. she writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and impresses both the queen and the chief advisor. after that her mother orders redecoration of the princess wing appoints two ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry and assigns a steward to handle her affairs. andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother. she notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an increase in the number and severity of storms. her studies and inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the manipulations of a great wizard. she reports this matter to her mother. afterward andromeda is resting high up in a tree within the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature. as it comes toward her she recognizes that it is a dragon. then it reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large dragon. it flames some high architectural features grabs a couple of animals and flies away. the panic within the palace is phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the queen's advisors is very lively. andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on dragons -- consisting mainly of myths and legends -- and reports to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon is the sacrifice of virginal maidens. the ensuing discussion is even livelier mostly concerning the means of choosing such sacrifices. queen cassiopeia states that the only fair way to select sacrifices is by a lottery. after the spate of crazy volunteers dies down a lottery is organized. some women find ways to disqualify themselves but others are taken by the dragon. rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against the queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the sacrifice. but then andromeda is selected. this novel is mostly about the influence of the tradition within the five hundred kingdoms. andromeda's knowledge of the tradition comes in handy at various points in this quest. the queen has sent to glass mountain for a champion to fight the dragon but the good knight doesn't come forward as expected. someone has erected a magical barrier at the border to keep out such warriors. however andromeda is sort of saved by a champion at the sacrificial site. andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and finally proves to the champion that she can be a help rather than a hindrance. they travel cross-country in the same direction that the dragon had flown stopping for supplies here and there and finally enter the wyrding lands. they encounter unicorns and a fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother. then andromeda learns that all is not as it seems. andromeda is nineteen and naive. then she is faced with one of the most difficult of issues: does her mother love her. while many events occur in this plot this one issue is the crux of the story. even her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a temporary relief from this main concern. highly recommended for lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure betrayal and romance. -arthur w. jordi ",positive

" these are true tales from a clinical neurologist's notebook but this isn't just any neurologist. oliver sacks author of the justly celebrated the man who mistook his wife for a hat (1986) and awakenings (1973) which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams and other works is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity. he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating yet studiously objective a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations historical comparisons and wisdom. part of the power of these tales and of all of sacks's work is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality. this makes for a compelling read. if you've never read sacks before you are in for a very special treat. these tales are paradoxical because defects disorders diseases can bring out latent powers developments evolutions forms of life that might never be seen or even be imaginable in their absence. it is this 'creative' potential that forms the central theme of this book (from sacks's preface page xvi). the first tale the case of the colorblind painter is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty-five and the effect this had on his life and work. the second the last hippie is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties. sacks tells this sad pathetic story with vivid detail and characteristically ends it with a footnote a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears. (don't skip the footnotes!) the third tale a surgeon's life is an amazing account of a canadian surgeon with tourette's syndrome. it is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination. dr. carl bennett riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder compulsions that cause him to throw things to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner to flail jump and jerk about nonetheless became a very successful (and beloved) doctor of surgery. sacks scrubs up with dr. bennett and goes into surgery with him during which miraculously the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery. sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be. the fourth tale to see and not see is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing. this sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain. this tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination. in the fifth tale the landscape of his dreams we meet a gifted artist franco magnani who from memory alone recreates his home town of pontito italy through his paintings. he has a nearly photographic three-dimensional memory but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty-one he cares only to re-create his pontito not the people or events but the houses the masonry the stones and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail. the chapter prodigies focuses on an autistic artist stephen wiltshire whom sacks is determined to befriend and understand. in this tale and the concluding tale an anthropologist on mars sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it (at least in my interpretation) as an alternate view of reality a view with its own strengths and weaknesses a world that is just as true and valid as the normal one. of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society. yet perhaps that is society's loss. i even got the sense in reading these concluding stories about autism that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary strategy trying to emerge that is a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work. i would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness and that humankind is the better for it. incidentally the last tale about temple grandin who is a professor of animal studies at colorado state university is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society yet remains autistic. she is the one who says she sometimes feels because of her different perspective like an anthropologist on mars when she views normal people. sacks allows us to see why. bottom line: this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition written with grace and a deep sense of humanity not to be missed ",positive

" in this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century. the often dense text is supplemented by biographical details witty asides and (especially) luxuriously reproduced introductions. hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages; he hopes to provide brief non-intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science. there is astonishingly little text and at times the pithiness compactness and occasional cuteness may work against readers' understanding; there's perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here. some sections are so cursory that i suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader. (this is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time event horizons and brane world models.) the text is aided greatly however by the beautifully rendered four-color illustrations. even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first the creativity and humor fused into moonrunner design's artwork will attract engage and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation. overall then the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated. yet it's certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further. if you're looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here i strongly recommend (as does hawking) alan guth's the inflationary universe or brian greene's the elegant universe.

" if a book makes me look forward to mid-life - i am all over it! this book was actually required reading for my course study in human development - what a find! here harvard researcher and bestselling author joan borysenko takes the cycles of a woman's life and divides them into 7 year increments. along the journey she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging.?that's a big 10-4 ms. borysenko! i find myself constantly at odds with the beauty images that the media gives us. i mean come on why 'o why are we more often rewarding people for how they look and less for what they contribute to society? perhaps it's escapism - i tell myself (in effort to sleep at night). yet after reading borsyenko's book i'm reminded that yes it's good to follow intellectual pursuits. and yes there's differences between women and men. according to borysenko women are most often motivated by what they can contribute to society family and how to make a difference in the world. men tend to define themselves by their work. most telling! anyhow i won't give away the store here - but in my opinion if you are of the female persuasion you will not want to miss this read.

" immediately upon starting dickens' our mutual friend i was struck by parallels with dumas' the count of monte cristo. both big novels revolve around a powerful character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to obtain social justice. the count deals with the darker theme of revenge. our mutual friend is an exploration of the corrupting influence of wealth. the novel is lively throughout as dickens displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents. the tone ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper-class politics and antisemitism to delicate romance to witty visual humor. the characterizations are highly original; even those at the extremes of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies. most impressive to me was the consistency of dickens' plot. our mutual friend was written and published in installments as was the count of monte cristo. but dickens keeps his story on track throughout never dropping a character while dumas' tale is full of gaps and inconsistencies ",positive
" i read this book several months ago and i still can't shake the feeling of having read a very very good book. the effect of yourcenar's words still lingers. the text is an imagined valedictory letter or speech from emperor hadrian to his successor. the emperor himself is dying and faces a world that he is about to leave behind. he recalls his life from being a young boy in his native spain to his ascension to the highest public post imaginable that of emperor of rome. just as his professional career was incredible so is the generosity and candidness of his confession. there is seemingly no secret nook left untouched from his personal life. in the end having cast that final weight his conscience from off his shoulders the emperor is at last able to turn away from one world and face another - that of the gods.

" this book is very readable because it is oriented to the general reader. chapter 1 gives his short autobiography as to why he became an anthropologist and his experiences in kenya. a forensic pathologist is a medical doctor trained in pathology. a forensic anthropologist has a ph.d. and studied anthropology specializing in the human skeletal system. chapter 3 tells about his laboratory and the tools used for his work. chapter 4 has many of the cases he worked on. chapter 5 notes that most dismemberments result from the drug trade or motorcycle gangs. the interstate highway system provides arteries for crimes and serial killers. (p.63). chapter 6 discusses cases of suicide. many people kill themselves without intending to. it is important to distinguish between murder and suicide (p.86). page 87 tells why florida has an inordinate number of suicides. chapter 7 explains how forensic anthropology developed in response to murders. this chapter discusses some famous cases of this relatively young science. page 101 tells how to distinguish between bone from rock by taste! chapter 8 says bones are not solid and unchanging they are constantly reshaping themselves. in chapter 9 maples tells of the use of capital punishment (p.128) and discusses the various methods (pp.129-131). he seems emotionally involved. chapter 10 informs us about cremation. chapter 11 has maples' most difficult and most fascinating and perplexing case. the two dead in high springs fl were linked to a shocking double murder in new hampshire (p.152). page jennings' parents made a big fatal mistake in sending their daughter so far away after her failure as a freshman (p.164). chapter 12 deals with the mia in vietnam about 2200 compared to the 8170 in korea. hollywood movies created this popular image of captured men (p.187). a delusion (p.188)? maples describes the us army central identification laboratory that identifies remains recovered from vietnam. page 202 tells what happened at the executive office building. chapter 13 tells of his investigation to recognize the skeleton of pizarro and correct an old mistake. the exhumation of president zachary taylor and the tests for arsenic poisoning are told in chapter 14. page 224 tells of his importance to those times: he backed free states in the new territories. his replacement changed his policies. chapter 15 may be the most historically important. maples was part of a team that identified the bones of tsar nicholas and his family. maples draws political conclusions from rotten neglected teeth (p.259). chapter 16 tells of the murder of five college students over two days in gainesville florida. maples identified the murder weapon (pp.271-273). the book concludes with the complaint that states are not funding forensic anthropologists who are few and far between especially in florida (pp.278-279). florida is the most crime-ridden state in the union. that is a political decision for each state government. this recalls the most realistic portion of quincy m.e.: whenever quincy wanted to do more research his manager often said there's no money in the budget!

" definitely a wonderful book. for those following the teachings of the other books this book provides more useful information. the path that castaneda elucidated is fraught with controvery and extreme views (read the other reviews). i found it useful to read and judge for myself. what castaneda wrote about is not fiction however it is a difficult path that very few ever advance upon thus the angry reviews of those calling castaneda a fraud due to their own failure. its also a path that those given to fantasy and believing in their own 'specialness' jump on and thus follow blindly with no lasting gains making up their experience as they go and making sure others hear about it. definitely not a path for everyone but certainly open to sober verification. also a great book for those looking for a well written and gripping book. i believe castaneda's genius as well as his contribution to mankind is yet to be fully appreciated. i am grateful for the gift of his writings and wisdom ",positive

" i am a chemistry major and so i really like this book however when i initially started o-chem i did get a little intimidated by perusing through this textbook. so i suggest to people who were in a similar position as me to also have a look at hornback or mcmurry. the text isnt an advanced textbook perse (after a good grounding in the basics for three days i found this book quite user friendly) its organization is completely different to most other o-chem textbooks and its presentation of ideas is purely mechanistic. both of which are ideally good things for chemistry majors who require the quintessential knowledge of structure and its impact on function and reactivity. an examples is that when introducing orbitals and orbital interaction; greeves et al quickly go to homo and lumo based discussions and their impact on bonding and antibonding. wade and mcmurry leave this one of the most important principles in defining nuclephiles and electrophiles till later. a second example would be the appropriate structural implications of nucleophiles and electrophiles with respect to vacant orbitals lone pairs and charge. these are the things used to identify em. as such the book isnt fragmented. each chapter has its specific niche topic and thereofore individuals get a complete understanding of various topics and their implications on the overall organic chemistry. chapters are well referenced so if say you are only interested in nmr then you can skip chapters and read only those pertaining to that subject and yet still get a good understanding. most textbooks act like a stupid monologue miss a passage and you'd completely miss organic chem. the chapter on reaction mechanisms is excellant it actually is better than most primers developed in explaining this concept (i.e. jacobs). however the organization and the concentration of information within chapters may be daunting to individuals who havent had enough experience in general chemistry. principles of structure and reactivity are assumed knowledge. organic chemistry in most universities are taken by biology and chemistry majors. for individuals who are only doing one unit of organic chemistry; i would suggest you look elsewhere. a substitute (a less difficult but equally comprehensive textbook for people lacking experience in chemistry) is hornback's which is renowned for its lucid mechanistic explantion of organic chemistry.

" my boyfriend bought from the earth to the moon and since he is an astrophysics student i expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people's conceptions about going to the moon at that early time. he however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things didn't make much sense. well from a layman's perspective i found from the earth to the moon engaging. it goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic physics and astronomy. even from my scientifically deprived perspective a lot of things in the book didn't make much sense such as the actual method of getting to the moon but this doesn't really take away from the book - it adds greatly to its appeal. the book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous. i was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work and what these poor souls were going to come up with next. compared to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and even journey to the centre of the earth however from the earth to the moon is noticeably less imaginative. verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality and much unlike his other works doesn't stray far from the earthly. some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion but all in all from the earth to the moon is a good read. if you drop at the sight of f(x) = y then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate. if you really know your physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today. if you like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then from the earth to the moon is definitely worth your time.

" first off this book is very entertaining to read. unlike many political books it is never tedious or redundant. thieves in high places is an accurate portrayal of what is wrong with both parties in america. it is also informative and insightful on the roles of big corporations in american politics and local economies. this book is a call to arms against large corporations that put locally owned businesses under companies that use child labor overseas and the entire americal political system. this book empowers the common man in his fight for an egalitarian society fair wages for all and a real equal oppurtunity at an education. i loved this book it was a pleasure to read and confirmed everything that disuades me about america today. it is worth a read ",positive

" the great locomotive chase is the stuff of legend. this somewhat obscure event which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on fort sumter could too easily be written off among civil war devotees as a lark a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from shiloh to the seven days to second manassas to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union. but first-time author russell bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms telling it well and placing it in its proper context. the raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue espionage and derring-do. and if mr. bonds had only told the tale itself this book would be well worth the read. but what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much civil war writing is mr. bonds's ability to tell this gripping tale objectively while putting it in its proper context. the author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after first manassas. and by doing so and by explaining why the raid coupled with the deep penetration of general ormsby mitchell into tennessee and north alabama offered the fleeting chance to cut the confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war mr. bonds gives the otherwise reckless lan of the raiders its proper place. andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark even though students of the era will have the natural reaction what were they thinking? mr. bonds answers that question and the answer as incongruous as it may seem reminds the reader that there was so much more to the great war than the epic battles of the armies of the potomac and northern virginia. if the author had done nothing more than told the story of the great raid reconciling contemporary accounts that were so often embellished this would be a wonderful adventure story in the great tradition of shelby foote's narrative history of the war. but this book does so much more. it puts the raid in its proper strategic context and it tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself failed. this book will satisfy both the devoted civil war critic and the general reader who loves a historical tale well-told.

" stephen king has written another attention grabber. i read and listened as i have both the paperback and the audio book. i found this book great as it follows both the imaginary and the real sides of life. i found that as i read the book i really would like to visit the library that is described in the book. this book follows down a strange path emerging in what could almost be explained as a real story of fact in the past. i recommend this novel and the audio book as the narrator does a great job it will not dissapoint as &quot;everything's eventual&quot; did in my opinion. good luck and good reading! (note: the audio version of this book is narrated by frank muller. anyone who has listened to stephen king audio books has sure to have been wowwed by frank muller. in this audio book recording frank muller's voice is almost unrecognizable and amazing as he plays this roll. frank muller and audio books are truly like movies for your mind) ",positive

" steven pinker has written a fascinating account of how language works; how we as listeners process the sounds that make up words and sentences in a way that allows us to extract meaning. the book is clear entertaining and very accessible; pinker's writing style is witty and engaging. my appreciation of the book is not only as a reader and enthusiast of language but also as a writer; despite having been writing for years and having studied numerous books on writing style and technique it is the language instinct that positively impacted my writing more than anything else that i've read; an understanding (at least a partial one - i'm no expert) of the way your words will be parsed by the brain of your reader can be very valuable in one's attempt to write clearly and well. i highly highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning something new and being entertained in the process. danny iny author of ordinary miracles - harness the power of writing and get your point across!

" `the savory way' is an early (1990) book from leading vegetarian cookbook author deborah madison so as ms. madison has a new book on the way i thought it was high time for me to catch up with her body of work so i can give an informed review of how her new volume fits into her other books. ms. madison is a former colleague of alice waters and lindsey shere at chez panisse who specializes in a very general way like mollie katzen and madhur jaffrey on dishes that fit into a vegetarian lifestyle. note that the term `vegetarian' especially as used by these three authors is extremely misleading as it is much more appropriate to say that they construct meals of everything under the sun except meat fowl fin fish and shell fish. both madison and jaffrey make extensive use of milk cheese yoghurt and eggs. madison's objective in this book is in fact to cover as broad as possible a survey of what can be done without using animal flesh. the book's title may be a bit misleading to some foodies in that `savory' is often one of the words used to divide dishes in two great groups of `savory' and `sweet'. this book in fact includes two rather long chapters on sweets. a first look at this book shows lots of headnotes to the many recipes. the first thing you need to know if you are put off by `chatty' recipe books is that these notes are almost exclusively devoted to an understanding of the cooking involved with the recipe and how to get the best results from your ingredients. while little stories about the historical provenance of a recipe may interest many including myself that is not what this book is about. on top of this i firmly agree with the blurbed opinion from mollie katzen who compliments both her cuisine and her writing. almost all professional culinary writers are pretty good or have an excellent copy editor at work on their prose but ms. madison is a food service professional who writes very well. i often wish the soon to be beknighted jamie oliver had a bit more talent with words as i find his books so comforting in spite of the heavy contribution from his editors. the very first attraction of the book is its table of contents which lists every single recipe title in the front of the book. this is doubly useful in that this relatively long book divides recipes into chapters covering eleven different types of dishes suitable for just about any time of the day including a good selection of recipes very good for breakfast. the eleven recipe chapters are: quick bites with 40 pages of recipes for sandwiches toasts and spreads. salads to start or make a meal with 42 pages soups and stews with 50 pages of thick thin and pureed soups including a new one with my favorite fall ingredient chestnuts. eighteen quick pasta dishes for five and company 32 pages stovetop vegetables 27 pages of sautes and braises. baked and roasted vegetables 25 pages with ratatouille gratins tians and other goodies. grilled vegetables and their sauces 11 pages with two to six sauces per grilled dish. down to earth 26 pages on rice potatoes and beans (although beans appear throughout all chapters!) morning foods for day and night 26 pages of eggs and cheese and cereals and breads. finishing touches 31 pages of sauces salsas condiments dressings pastes and you name it. desserts 45 pages on fruit dishes cream cheeses pastries and custards sweetmeats 12 pages on sweet pastes peels syrups dried fruits and other dessert dressings. every recipe i examined is relatively simple to prepare with fewer expensive or rare ingredients than you may find with jaffrey or jack bishop and great tips on understanding the recipes and the ingredients. the appendix is just right for the occasional home cook who is lost in the forest of equipment you can find in a first rate kitchen supply store such as the second floor at zabars. ms. madison puts it all in perspective by highlighting all my favorite tools such as gratin and tian pots the mortar and pestle a few good knives the food mill and the pizza stone and peel. the chapter on the pantry has lots for the novice and a few good tips for the foodie such as the fact that mexican olive oils can be very spicy. possibly the best items in the appendix are the lists of dishes for special purposes such as entertaining feeding large groups and fitting into a low fat diet (note that for the number of recipes in this book this low fat list is surprisingly short). the list of sources is short with no internet sites provided but i recognize that virtually all of these vendors are still in business. the bibliography is also brief but hits all the right titles especially joy larkcom's excellent `the salad garden'. this book is a great resource for `liberal' vegetarians who simply eschew meat. i would add this to madhur jaffrey's `world vegetarian' peter berley's `the modern vegetarian kitchen' and jack bishop's `the complete italian vegetarian' to create a great core vegetarian library. i cannot at this time compare this to ms. madison's other books as this is the first i have read although i sense many of her more recent books have a narrower scope focusing on vegetable dishes. i plan to review her other books in the next few days. highly recommended for both vegetarians and foodies in general.

" one of the things i like about this book for young readers is that the same vocabulary words are repeated throughout the series so that the kids can build on what they learned in one book while they're reading the next. at first i was disappointed with the series since i didn't think it did justice to the little house series that i treasured myself as a girl. after a few reads however i see that the magic of laura ingalls wilder's stories shines through in this series with renee graef's illustrations. how else do you explain to a four-year-old what a log cabin is really like? i am surprised how many how.. and why... questions this series has provoked. regarding this book in particular my daughter asked about a million questions about the maple syrup-making process ",positive

" the case for faith is the weakest volume in a strong series. strobel's format is fun and engaging. i find his books as un-put-downable as any blockbuster page-turner. strobel holds a degree from yale law school and he was an award-winning legal editor at the chicago tribune. he begins with a question: does historical evidence support the historicity of jesus? does current science support the existence of a creator god? does it make sense to have faith in god? and then travels north america interviewing acknowledged academic experts on the question at hand. some rather shrill and not entirely rational attacks on the web protest: but strobel's books aren't fair because he only presents one side! perhaps these individuals missed the titles of these books titles that appear quite prominently on the covers of the books. the first three words of each title is the case for... no strobel is not presenting the case *against* his topic; he doesn't represent himself as doing so. our christophobic media and academia presents that case relentlessly; why should strobel waste paper and time doing that when that is obviously not what he purports to be doing? strobel's accounts of his interviews of the experts are always reader-friendly but he never talks down to his reader. if you don't want to wade through the all too often alienating prose of too much academic writing but want to get to the nub of the issue strobel is your man. these techniques worked excellently in the case for a creator and the case for christ but less well in the case for faith. there are three remarkably strong episodes in the book; these episodes highlight what the rest of the book lacks. in the introduction strobel interviews canadian evangelist turned atheist charles templeton. templeton presents a righteous enraged case *against* god and then tearfully admits how much he continues to adore jesus and indeed to miss him. this wrenching passage masterfully captures the dilemma of many who have a love-hate relationship with their creator. in a few brief pages that serve as coda to chapter one which addresses the question of suffering strobel's friend marc harrienger talks about his own pain when his wife ran over their child with the family car. this very brief account is testimony to the power of faith even in the face of profound suffering. in another brief passage strobel tells of his friend ron bronski who went from being a vicious criminal to being a christian minister. these highly personal passages are what i will remember best from this book; they were the most rewarding to read. the formal interviews with the experts didn't do a lot for me and some were alienating. norman geisler's treatment of the slaughter of the amalakites alienated me with its coldness and divorce from human concerns. it may be true that in war children are killed with their adults -- when the us bombed german and japanese cities during ww ii we killed children as well as adults -- but any attempt to address such killings would have to be delivered with more compassion than geisler manages to convey. too there is doubt if not complete disbelief among archaeologists as to whether these wars of conquest ever took place (see israel finkelstein.) the chapter entitled church history is littered with oppression and violence was especially weak compared to other treatments of the same material. strobel's treatment of the witch trials could have been improved with insights from lyndal roper's work. strobel doesn't handle understandings of nazism as a christian phenomenon well at all. the insistence that nazism was a christian phenomenon is revisionist and divorced from historical fact and that should be made immediately clear as day in any discussion of the matter. nazism was a pagan and a scientific phenomenon. the pagan swastika was to replace the christian cross. scientific approaches to what constitutes life worthy of life was to replace weak christian ideas about humanity's unity as god's children and the value of all life. this is not made clear enough in strobel's account. all in all i have to say i've encountered better treatments of the question of faith in other books ... and yet strobel is such a good writer and his technique is so engaging that you could do worse than to read this book. read the other two books in the series first though.

" april of 1865 has been referred to as the month that saved america but april of 1861 may have been just as vital if not more so. it was during this time that washington dc sat completely surrounded by two states that were teetering on the verge of secession. once virginia did leave the union only maryland provided the federal government with a connection to the rest of the nation and it was a tenuous connection at best. abraham lincoln was clearly out of his league in this early stage of the game and he leaned heavily on general winfield scott. for his part scott was keenly aware of the danger facing washington and began to immediately call for any militia units that could get to dc quickly from loyal northern states. the problem was that these militia units would have to travel through maryland a slave state that might well consider these yankee troops to be invaders and could easily be pushed into the confederacy by such an affront to state sovereignty. it was also distinctly possible that these militia units might be attacked by not only the people of maryland but also ultimately by the state militia. in the meantime virginia forces had seized the federal armory at harper's ferry and the gosport navy yard near hampton virginia. rumors are rampant in dc that the virginia militia that had taken harper's ferry was preparing to move on washington and many in the federal city were in a state of panic. the questions that arise from this drama involve the decision making process on both sides and the ultimate question is of course whether washington dc was ever in any real danger. did the confederacy in fact lose it's only real chance for ultimate victory during this time period? david detzer has done an admirable job in this book of not only bringing this evolving drama to life but also of answering these questions in a clear and concise manner. this book reads much like a great historical drama and the author's writing style is superbly readable. it is rare for the author of a history book to achieve such a sense of drama since the reader usually already knows the outcome. detzer has accomplished this however and although i was keenly aware of what was about to happen at every turn i had a tough time putting the book down. this invigorating writing style is often derisively referred to as popular history but detzer blows the sides off of that old mold by not only offering new information but also keen observations that cut directly to the heart of this eventful period of american history. no hero of american history is spared criticism when criticism is due and conversely even ben butler is praised when his actions merit it. this is the story of those fateful days of april and may of 1861 and it is a story that is well told by this supremely able author. this book is well researched very well written and the story is told from the point of view of both governments as well as the lowliest private in the pennsylvania militia. it is a story upon which the fate of the united states once turned ",positive

" this book describes the eleven-year psychotherapy process for a woman with sixteen different personalities. the analysis process took place from 1954 through 1965. sybil the subject of the book was a child of the 1920's and 30's and her multiple-personality disease was a result of her family's genetic history and her fundamentalist repressed and abusive upbringing. much of sybil's struggles were due to the time period in which she lived--her family had mental illness but felt that ignoring it and focusing on other pursuits was the best course of action. she was so denied the exploration of her feelings that she choked back all symptoms of mental illness and tried to act normal hindering her recovery for years. i am still in shock over the patience and dedication that was required to work with the frustratingly different personalities over a period of eleven years! i got frustrated at the slow and relapse-prone re-integration process at the end of the book and i admire schreiber for painstakingly recounting the process instead of using hollywood-style short-cuts. sybil's recovery and emergence as a complete functional woman in her forties was a very hard-won victory. during the revealing of sybil's personalities i really liked vicky. she was the all-seeing personality who know the lineage of all others. i liked her better than i liked the backbone-less sybil and i wanted her to exist for this lost woman. during the personality-integration process i learned that all of the personalities were a part of sybil and such exaggerated emotion as vicky's had to be integrated in to part of the whole sybil. overall this is an amazing book that well stands the test of time.

" those who condemn this book for not being a long boring list of name origins and meanings or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today's children are missing the point. baby names now is a fun readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s including famous namesakes (saints popes presidents royalty music and movie stars) and what some celebrities have named their children. it's also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style: for example lisa amy susan and dawn were very popular for babies born in the 60s (and thus my classmates) but are rarely used today. the book's major flaw is in not recognizing that parents name their children using the last names of people they admire not just the first names. at one point it reads harrison ford...is almost certainly the reason for the name harrison's popularity - excuse me ever hear of the beatles? the entries for the name jordan don't mention michael jordan certainly a major inspiration for that name in this area. the entry for jackson doesn't mention michael janet or samuel l. the entry for landon doesn't mention michael. the entries for cassidy don't mention david and shaun so popular in the 70s when many of today's moms were growing up. the entry for lucas - do i have to say it fellow star wars kids grown up and naming their children? and come on how can you mention the name wayne without acknowledging the popularity of john wayne? still this is a lot of fun and i give the authors credit for recognizing that althea is from a grateful dead song. i look forward to the next edition ",positive

" carlton mellick the 3rd's punk land (a pseudo-sequel to his 2001 novel satan burger) wastes no time in getting straight to the story. it is set in an alternate heaven for punks where sid vicious is god and you are judged for entry not by st. peter but rather a number of gate attendants who decide whether or not you are punk enough. mellick's trademark off-beat humor and sideways take on religion is ever-present along with a slew of philosophical ideas mixed with a juvenile sense of mischief. although it is a sequel it stands completely on it's own. fans of satan burger will appreciate the references and the continued story of nan and mortician but new readers aren't left wondering about a back story. and anyone with even a slight interest in punk rock or punk culture will be in well punk heaven with all the references to punk history and culture and appearances by icons including g.g. allin henry rollins and johnny rotten. the book is also full of illustrations diagrams photos and lists which help to give it a wonderful multimedia type feel. you'll find yourself torn between finishing the paragraph you're in and jumping directly over to the flier for the pbr pogo joust advertised on the next page. this is a great book a sublimely goofy sort of work that is effortlessly good but never takes itself too seriously. highly recommended for anyone who likes mellick's work but even more so for anyone who has never read any of his books. this is a great place to discover the works of a young groundbreaking author who is only getting better with time ",positive

" a remarkable introduction to ezra pound. makin explains some of the underlying structures that order the cantos--periplous ideogram fugue the 'repeat in history'--and gives concise readings of individual sections that helped my understanding enormously. he does an especially good job of connecting pound's theory of money to his views on sex and creativity. makin manages to be critical of pound while treating his ideas with verve and sympathy; the writing is colloquial witty and jargon-free. i enjoyed the cantos much more after reading this short effective study ",positive
" i'm gonna quote a paragraph from the book please note - in no way can this paragraph tell you anything about the book or spoil it for those who havent read it. a woman left at home would close her eyes and the power of her need would enable her to see her man on his ocean ship battling pirates with pistol her man in the battle's fray with his sword and shield standing victorious among corpses her man in a desert whose sands were on fire amid mountain peaks drinking the driven snow. so long as he lived she would follow his journey would feel his elation and his grief and if he died a spear of love would fly back across the world to pierce her waiting omniscient heart. it would be the same for him. in the midst of desert's fire he would feel her cool hand on his cheek and in the heat of battle she would murmur the words of love into his ear : live live. that was what the stories said about love. that was what human beings knew love to be. shalimar the clown was about as good as i thought it would be. it definitely isn't the best book i've read this year but i must say salman rushdie's writing style captivates me nonetheless. in between the most relevant paragraphs he says things that are unique and have a true stronghold on the reader's mindset. in this book he mentions a quote twice which really caught my eye. one doesn't know the questions of life until one is asked another thing i noticed about the book is that the central character shalimar is seldom mentioned. the book seems to hover around other dozen characters. only in prison and in that one letter sent back to kashmira does shalimar's true character really come out. the second quarter of the book got immensely boring and i really despise how max's character was written about. it was annoying difficult to read over-detailed and excruciating to read. boonyi was an outstanding character. so was the old witch and boonyi's father. when colonel tortoise was mentioned in the book i thought his character would prove of some consequence but nothing about yielded anything. one couldn't help but dislike max's lack of integrity. mythology is rather well written about in this book. every 50 pages a one page something would be mentioned including just the right amount of detail and words. conclusion - while readingtime and again i would rage on to my friend about how superb the writer's grasp on the reader is. the writer knows his wordswhere to use them he knows that he has a prodigious way of writing and he employed them better than ever. maybe this book disappointed his core fans. maybe it lacked a spark enough to obilerate doubt. all in all i can say that salman rushdie has a wierd way of his own. his vocabulary is truly astounding. maybe he is the most learned writer i've ever read if not the best. respect. h.s anand -17th october'06 12.13p ",positive

" i am a huge john grisham fan. i believe the first grisham book i ever read was the pelican brief. after that i was hooked. i admit that through the years mr. grisham's work has become less grishamisc and not as entertaining as earlier works. but you'll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does. i first started this book by listening to it on cd. i soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it. i was right! the book starts out with action and pulls you in. the action barely lets up through the entire book. this is a different kind of action. more mental than physical. there seems to always be something going on and grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter. one thing that is very different about this book than most of his works is that there isn't really a catch at the end or a mystery to solve. generally we find grisham leading us to a thriller ending. however in this book it is more of a life lesson about greed. there is no bad guy nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character etc. the book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life. the characters are likeable and easy to follow. there are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is irrelevant to the story. i found the book very easy to read and follow. i always wanted more. although the book has a different theme than most grisham books i still really enjoyed it. it reminded me why i like to read his books so much. it proves he write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending. if you like this one try the eariler works as well. if you have seen the movies it doesn't matter because the books are always better and usually different in some way. this book would make a good movie but we'll see if anyone in hollywood agrees with me on that point. happy reading ",positive

" dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it. dragonart: how to draw fantastic dragons and fantasy creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper. dragonart is divided into three major parts fantastic dragons unique details and other fantasy creatures along with an introduction a section on how to use the book and a brief guide to fantastic creatures. lessons in this book are progressive in nature beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design all illustrated with step-by-step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout. and author/artist jessica neondragon peffer has a clear easy writing style that can be easily comprehended absorbed and acted upon an example of which follows below. okay so we're going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds. sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct but that will happen if your creature doesn't look believable. to help make your dragon as real as possible base its structure on real creatures she writes at one point (page 44). the ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat bird and reptile body types. the trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out. you want it to feel like a single creature. this advice incidentally is very reminiscent of that given by leonardo da vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk making peffer well read or naturally very insightful either of which speaks well for her. under how you should make an imaginary animal look natural the increasingly famous renaissance man writes you know that you cannot invent animals without limbs each of which in itself must resemble those of some other animal. hence if you wish to make an animal imagined by you appear natural -- let us say a dragon take for its head that of a mastiff or hound with the eyes of a cat the ears of a porcupine the nose of a greyhound the brow of a lion the temples of an old cock the neck of a water tortoise. dragonart also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures including basilisks chimeras gargoyles and griffins. for those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book a companion dragonart kit: how to draw & paint fantastic creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon. author peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art website neondragonart.com which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves.

" reinventing the bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader. from pharmaceutical companies to the tokyo fish market mcmillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes. he attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets and in my opinion he succeeds. each chapter presents a new market setting which mcmillan uses to illustrate his various points. while the book has an economic undertone the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student. all terminology is explained not only with words but with examples as well. the book was enjoyable especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings. however i would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book ",positive

" first off i loved the book cover- spine and all-- one of my all time favorites. it's what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward-facing covers on the store's front table. then the title i loved that just as much. both share the characteristics of being straightforward to the point and revealing. both are perfectly simple. i read most the essays and came to think that a. this guy really does his homework and b. he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi. i constantly begged for my dictionary. it's probably what gets him the press i knew before i picked this up: an intellectual snob. i guess he got that from the oprah incident. but i also guess that there's lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career. what's up with this culture that it's so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon? the attraction to franzen's work is that he investigates and reveals- in a binary way: he's researching facts he's listening to feelings; he's processing both to give an opinion. the best example of this is my father's brain in which he relates the alzheimer induced decomposing of his father's brain. there is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay; as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss. reading it you sympathize you empathize and you learn. equally as insightful are : lost in the mail- a look into possible reasons behind chicago's underperforming mail system the reader in exile- a great reflection on the intellectual and emotional fruits of reading first city- a historical and pensive piece about what pulls us towards cities meet me in st. louis- a piece that shares the two-sided feelings in a trio of situations (including the oprah incident).

" this is the first piece of writing i have read from albert camus and i found it very interesting. the character meursault is a very indifferent character who seems to be very impartial when he hears of his mother's death and kind of continues to be static untill the the second half of the book. i do not want to give the book away as some of the others have but i feel that no matter what one person does and no matter what ones perception is it can never match the perception of others. one of my favorite lines in the story is when meursault is talking to the chaplain about seeking redemption through god because according th chaplain it is not the human justice that matters but divine justice and meursault's response was it was the human justice that put me here. no matter what acts you commit whether they be henous incensitive or loving one way or another you will be judged and upon that judgement will be your sentence. it was definitely an easy read that takes the readers on a ride into the thoughts of a man who accepts the one thing he can not change; his fate. with this i dont even have a chance to survive not even a slim one ",positive

" paul johnson has written a 1000-page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815-1830 years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today. johnson's chosen foci are certainly broad: he ranges from events in politics and law to music science and even opium use. while almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function johnson's roving eye and pen can be disconcerting: he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning. also while the book claims to be about world society johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about british society -- but he's found plenty of ways to range geographically from the western united states (like kentucky) to china and singapore. throughout his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read. overall johnson has given us what might be the ultimate in bedtime reading: a vast book that one can pick up open nearly at random and learn something interesting about the past but which retains significance today ",positive

" a recent dallas morning news column profiling t.d. jakes quoted a university of houston sociology professor saying that jakes is incredible in how he's able to diagnose people's pain. he has an uncanny ability to put a finger on the human condition. jakes' new book he-motions illustrates the verity of the professor's statement. in he-motions jakes nails the issues and challenges christian men face today in trying to fulfill their many roles and pursue their dreams. jakes writes from his heart and soul as a pastor father husband and entrepreneur. in the opening pages he describes his motivation for writing: i want to share what i've learned. i want to cut through so much of the junk imposed on men today and talk heart to heart about what it means to be a man not in some touchy-feely group hug kind of way but in an honest soul-bearing way which also respects men and honors the women who love them and whom they love. jakes thoroughly succeeds in fulfilling his desire for this book. not only does he address male readers but he also targets female readers who hope to gain insights about men. jakes' no-holds barred writing offers refreshing candor for those wanting an honest assessment of who they are and where they are in life. jakes writes about his childhood his ministry his family and his ups and downs in life-always tying stories to life lessons for readers. it does not take the reader long to discern that jakes possesses a vast breadth of wisdom and understanding about the inner workings of men in our culture. jakes writes that a man must value himself. he-motions can help readers make great strides in finding value in themselves-regardless of their circumstances. he encourages men to refuse to become discouraged but to keep moving toward their destiny while simultaneously enjoying the splendid moments of life's journey. the book is written as if jakes is in the room having a one-on-one talk with the reader. if it was in fact such a talk it would surely involve laughing weeping praying and dreaming. one such example of the conversational style is when jakes writes about balancing family and career. he writes i'm here to tell you that if you don't contain your work life and segregate it from your home life then your career will consume the marriage like a campfire blazing outside of its circle of rocks and roaring into a life-threatening forest fire. there is not an area of discussion where jakes lets men off the hook. he writes authoritatively about power money and sex. in the financial arena jakes commands readers stop asking god to bless an area where you refuse to obey his word for your life. in one relationship area after another jakes' writing leads the reader to self-examination awareness forgiveness and improvement. his writing on subjects such as a man's relationships with his father children wife other men time money and god is honest and down to earth. it is also practical as are the questions for men and women at the end of each chapter. throughout the book jakes references the life of david to shed light on the above relationships from a biblical perspective. jakes encourages readers that someone needs to know who you are and where you are at all times in your walk and life. this book could be an effective tool to use in a discussion or accountability group to help people grow stronger relationships. i encourage men and women to take advantage of the wisdom and insights jakes shares in this book ",positive
" i found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research &amp; of tracking earnings estimates. mitch zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform. the zacks rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years...it seems as if the zacks rank really is accurate and more imporartantly a successful investing method...this is the first book i have read that has actually helped me make money rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads. overall good book i would definitely recommend it ",positive
" this is hawking's attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math. while still not an easy read it it much easier than the brief history of time that he wrote for laypeople before this. a person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field. older teens who have some interest in sciences may also find this to be a helpful introduction to the concepts they think they want to study in depth ",positive

" rewind to 1992. it's the dawn of the so-called information & knowledge age. back then i wrote a book on the need to liberate and effectively channel the creativity of all employees in an organization. the rationale: to create higher performing organizations in a time of intense global competition. with pressing needs for superior innovation. and improved productivity. amid ever-leaner budgets. (sound familiar?) flash forward a dozen years to today and ideas are free (a title echoing phil crosby's classic quality is free). this new book makes clear today that my impassioned plea from a decade ago failed to eradicate idea-stifling organizational cultures. way too many work places it seems still quell expressions of innovative thinking by both frontline employees and middle managers. so the case for turning on the innovation spigot needs to be made again with renewed vigor. in answering that call professors robinson & schroeder offer some worthwhile and occasionally surprising and compelling contributions to this topic that is as relevant now as ever. ideas are free presents an articulate case that organizations -- and individual managers -- need to unleash the *still* largely untapped brainpower intentionally and quite unfortunately held-back by employees. three elements make ideas are free especially worthy of your time and money. 1. the authors aim their advice at regular workaday managers. sure they rightfully point out how organizational systems are often dysfunctional. and they make the case that many corporate practices actually *discourage* creative contributions by individuals even as they try to *incent* those very behaviors. but robinson & schroeder don't aim their prescriptions at policy-making top executives only. many chapters conclude with what the authors term guerilla tactics -- clear directives for simple actions that even frontline supervisors can put to work without the boss's permission. 2. the book dramatically makes the case that paying for ideas -- as part of an organization's formal suggestion systems -- is fraught with potential negative side-effects. my own corporate experience as an executive championing a newly installed suggestion system bears out the startling reality that this well-intentioned process can turn into a self-destructive minefield. (and let the record show i largely missed this dimension in covering suggestion systems back in my '92 work.) 3. many interesting well-developed (albeit occasionally dated) anecdotes illustrate the book's sound principles. they help make ideas are free a grounded engaging and palatable read. back in '92 i suggested in my book mavericks! that managers should be asking questions like: what is the value of a useful new idea? if one good idea leads to another where could thousands and thousands lead us? what is the cost to the organization for not tapping the endlessly renewable resource of ideas in our employees' heads? getting to the root of the problem i asked: isn't the job of a manager to *recognize and choose* from lots of great ideas generated by fellow work associates? and answered: unfortunately most managers -- even those who claim they invite suggestions from their people -- subscribe to the time-honored myth that a manager's job is to *have* the ideas. in 2004 robinson & schroeder again plow many of these very same themes (and cite data that also have been around for a long time). still this book explores afresh the opportunities that arise from drawing out the best thinking of every employee. and it presents realistic tactics that all managers can deploy to effectively deal with these still-critical issues. wherever you sit in the hierarchy read ideas are free to seize powerful ideas about potential gains for your organization's progress and prosperity. don blohowiak lead well institut ",positive

" if you are familiar with the work of strobel this book will continue to impress you. if you are not however and would like to know where the author is coming from i encourage you to read his previous works the case for christ and the case for faith so that you might better understand strobel. some people have condemned this book because strobel doesn't present the evolutionary side well. i have a few quick observations to make. first of all he's a journalist; he asks tough questions and for the most part gets good responses. second everyone has an agenda without exception. strobel and those who he interviews analyze and break down the views of prominent evolutionists and modern darwinian scientific views. finally it is clear from the outset that strobel wants to make a compelling case for id. this is not an unreasonable goal. the fact that he doesn't interview evolutionists shouldn't bother anyone based on his obvious objectives. if you want a book that allows evolutionists and designers to write you want to look into a point-counter point series book. if you want to understand the current id debate and would like to get a real good look at some of the cosmological evidence for a creator this book is for you ",positive
" thankfully this is not littered with platitudes and meaningless anaologies the hallmarks of 99% of the latest-and-greatest business books. especially since it was written in 1999 moore's is an incredibly insightful and prophetic book on strategy for the high-tech industry. he was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005. the book is much more descriptive than prescriptive though and is best used as a tool to instigate discussions about corporate strategy rather than as a checklist for strategic implementation. i help run an online software development company and although it isn't exactly high tech i still found the vast majority of it very helpful and the rest of it fascinating. market shifts are demanding broadband wireless internet everywhere--free. companies are shifting towards web-basing software applications. all very relevant to my business. the book is well written an easy and moderately fast read and very accessible by anyone who is technology-savvy enough to at least hold an email address. yes buy it. buy the paperback and save money. short synopsis: in the infancy of a market products need to be highly tailored to meet the psychological and technical needs of leading edge techno-geeks; nothing new here. when a company wants to take that product and make it marketable to the middle majority--where the biggest money sits--it requires a commitment to discipline and shift its strategy in order to do so. the emphasis shifts intially to identifying a single niche segment and creating a comprehensive tailored product that meets all of their needs--create the whole product by using partners and 3rd party services to patchwork the thing together. then stop tweaking the product. if that works pick related niches and go after them the same way creating the whole product for each of them. once people at large are comfortable enough to make the paradigm shift for that market (this all deals with new high-tech changes) and start doing so en masse the strategy must completely shift again to a ship-first / fix-the-product-later mentality in a mad market share scramble. at this phase you are in the tornado. lots of examples of successful and abysmal strategies used by high tech companies whose names are familiar to everyone at each stage mentioned above.

" gaylife on the english countryside is like everywhere you never know when your bf (boyfriend) gets bored with you. the battle with london's competitive nightlife makes you reguarly ask yourself: &quot;what have i to offer&quot;? the efforts to entertain your bf are as tiresome as the question how organize your own life so it won't get dull. and once you got things fixed you yourself run into this willing guy. the tragicomedy the spell tells the story of four men robin the ageing architect who enjoys his life together with his younger bf justin a witty layabout robin's son danny a georgeous body dealing in superficiality and justin's former lover alex a well-mannered young man in search for consistency. to find out if they all get what they want is a truly delicious way to spend your time. the story is written out of the perspective of all leading parts and therefore very nicely ballanced. hollinghurst is gifted with a great sense of attentiveness. his characters show many different moods caused by tiny events. every self-assured attitude is merciless exposed. i recognized myself and my friends many times without realizing this ever before. it made me smile and reassured me. i think this is hollinghurst's most post-modern novel. unlike the swimming-pool library's sexual odyssee this is a splintered glimps into life and how down to earth it can be ",positive
" it's easy to realize once again what makes garth ennis one of the best writers in the field when reading this one. throughout the story i was unable to predict what was going to happen on the next page. and despite ennis making this into a rollercoaster ride he still keeps it all believable. mind you this story is not on par with the preacher series not much is but it still is a story that rises far above the average comic book story. the characters are all interesting often funny and they'll hold your attention with ease. not once was the story faltering. and in the case of you being a smoker-maybe at the end you'll be cured of that habit. as another reviewer pointed out this is one hell of an anti-smokers `add'. so if you feel like picking up a well told story with constantine in the lead you'll do best to pick up this one. if however you are not yet acquainted with ennis's preacher than you better turn to that one.

" lee smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist ready if needs be to question cherished assumptions. one is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many people the book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory where he initially states as he sees it the five big problems in physics. in this context he makes the very important point that since the end of the 1970's there has not been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary particle physics and in particular he claims string theory does not achieve such a breakthrough. in making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics. but then he builds up his case against the theory. he says that string theory does not reproduce the standard model probably the most successful theory in physics but even predicts particles not seen in nature. it did not predict and does not cater for dark energy nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions. in particular he says string theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics. he also notes that here is no complete formulation for string theory. he shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed but notes that this theory m theory still remains a tantalizing conjecture. he says hopes for a unique string theory have receded. this reviewer would not dare to comment on his assertions but will say that any assertions he makes are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect of the reader. indeed new ideas are needed in physics as lee smolin says. we are missing something big. there is a feeling though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough - that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the `murk' into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature. the clues are there. to do this lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed. he also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does not. and whether it is `lateral' thinking or a breakthrough revolution in `conceptual' thinking new thinking is definitely required. lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that. he chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation. a good choice perhaps. i strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book if they have not already done so.

" jonathan glover's book is not quite like anything you've read on war state terror and genocide. the tour of twentieth-century horrors is thematic rather than chronological organized according to the ethical issues glover wants to explore. this takes a little getting used to but it allows the author to jump for example from the first world war to the cuban missile crisis to see which lessons had been learned in the interim and which might be applied in the future. the cumulative power of glover's pointillist technique is enormous. &quot;humanity&quot; combines a clear-eyed (necessarily often gruesome) depiction of *in*humanity with an informed and enlightening discussion of how leaders and ordinary people can change things for the better. as an examination of the psychological and existential origins of mass murder and genocide it marks an advance on ervin staub's classic &quot;roots of evil&quot; and should be of interest to any student of modern history and politics ",positive

" i was wrong. ok i've admitted it. i always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels weren't my cup of tea. while reading conspiracy in death i realized i couldn't have been more wrong - i love this futuristic series! a homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to eve dallas since it's not a random act of violence. this man snooks died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon. when dallas digs a bit further she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in new york city where an aged lc (licensed companion) died as the result of her liver being removed. after even more digging dallas discovers a case in chicago and one abroad that were all similar. these were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying. in order for eve dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen. the closer she got to that answer the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became. when she got too close to the truth the villain had to put a stop to her investigation. the best way to get dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department. this was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered snook's body and dallas. when that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on dallas. stripped of her badge and weapon the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied. the main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise. there was excellent character development and as usual j.d. robb (aka nora roberts) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book. what makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of eve dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that. at times it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot. this is definitely one to read as all of the in death series books have been. start with the first book when reading because j.d. robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings. or you can start with the first book just because it's the beginning of an excellent adventure!

" the boston based author dennis lehane wrote a great detective story with a social background so great it is almost more important than the plot. mystic river differs from lehane's other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer. mystic river is set in the fictional boston suburb called east buckingham (the author explains it as an amalgamate of dorchester charlestown and south boston and it really feels like dorchester) home mostly to white working class with plenty of crime. i liked the background info especially since i could relate to it knowing the area... the first part which is the base and explanation for later events takes place in 1975 when one of the three eleven-year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple-smelling car and although he comes back after four days his life as well as his friends' is changed forever. the ways of the boys soon part dave (the boy taken by the men) lives a quiet life has a wife and a son and likes his memories of being a football player in high school. jimmy the bad boy after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen-year old daughter from his first marriage second wife and their two daughters. the third boy college-educated sean becomes a policeman. when jimmy's beautiful daughter katie is found murdered in the park after a night out dave comes home covered in blood sean gets assigned to the case. there are many leads to different people... but the case is difficult. meanwhile jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own. the plot is very good until the end and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate. the characters are very real especially jimmy and sean who are central to the plot. their trauma after dave's abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very different ways. they are complicated multifaceted people very well developed as literary characters. some side protagonists depicting perhaps types rather than individuals (bobby roman the savage brothers sergeant whitey) are very good. i was in the grasp of this book until the end - it is not only great entertainment but also food for thought. the movie based on mystic river with sean penn is equally moving - recommended for those with little time...

" his basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world and that the united states is already an empire but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force. ferguson writes that america is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life. thus we get distracted too easily from important events overseas and when we do try to intervene we want quick fixes and low costs. i couldn't agree more with most of these points. as an american i'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance. i hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because i watch the news or can find sumatra on a map. also the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions. countless times i believe america has done more harm than good by if you will talking the talk but not walking the walk. if we commit to something we need to follow through. this is as true in iraq today as it has been in the past. we've claimed to support democracy in latin america but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies. we greatly prolonged and increased vietnam's suffering without changing the end result at all. with all this commonality however there are a few leaps of logic that ferguson makes that i can't bring myself to agree with. basically he didn't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world. how are we supposed to know what is best for everyone? won't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts? when ferguson hold's up the british empire as a model of success i can't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of british colonization with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there. and the two greatest examples of beneficial american imperialism - japan and germany - were already highly developed before world war ii so it probably wasn't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state. even if the positive power of empire is conceded there are important differences between the state of world during the british empire and the state of the world now. it's a concern of immunity from repercussions. in the golden age of imperialism europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires. not to say that there were no reprercussions but with the only modern navies in the world europe was immune to any very serious threats. on the other hand in today's world as an effect of globalization power has become more decentralized in some respects. think wmdsterrorists and foreign investments in the u.s. economy for example. can america as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the british could? in the end colossus didn't settle any agruments for me but raised new and interesting questions. it is a book that makes you think and that in and of itself is worth four stars.

" shakespeare's life is frustratingly beyond our sight. aside from the plays (which in many cases come down to us in different versions) we have a slim scattering of legal documents marriage and birth records and vague secondary accounts. as the world's preeminent shakespeare scholar greenblatt has managed to assemble all these sources and with a healthy dose of conjecture arrive at something resembling a biography of the world's greatest dramatist. more than that though this work is a biography of the age in which shakespeare lived and wrote---elizabethan and jacobian london---and how the major events of this time affected shakespeare's plays. for example the writing of king lear may have been encouraged by a trial in 1603 in which two sisters tried to have their father declared insane so they could take control of his wealth and estate while the youngest daughter (named cordell) tried to stop them---a story uncannily similar to what is considered to be the bard's greatest tragedy. what impressed me the most about this biography is how ordinary shakespeare seemingly was. he didn't seem pretentious or snobbish as some people envision him. he was born to a humble family and lived frugally despite dying a rather wealthy man. although greenblatt's writing is clear and accessible he makes the assumption that you have already read shakespeare's plays or at least are very familiar with them. i have read about two thirds of them and felt a little behind when he discussed plays i hadn't read so if you haven't read more than say ten of his plays the major ones you need to crack open the norton shakespeare (of which greenblatt is the editor-in-chief) before you approach will in the world.

" the late carl sagan was one of the most popular influential and successful interpreters of astronomy to the american public. in 1973 he published &quot;the cosmic connection&quot;. he offered a daring view of the universe and his seminal work became a classic of popular science inspiring a generation of scientists and non-specialist general readers with an enthusiasm for all aspects of science in general and astronomy in particular. now cambridge university press has reissued a new edition of sagan's influential book enhanced with freeman dyson's commentary on sagan's vision and on the importance of &quot;the cosmic connection&quot;; ann dryan's assessment of sagan's cultural significance as a champion of science; and david morrison's discussion of the advances made over the past 30 years and what became of sagan's predictions. carl sagan's cosmic connection is &quot;must&quot; reading for all sagan fans and anyone interested in how his views and predictions have held up over the past three decades of rapid advances in the science of astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ",positive
" perhaps the long shadow of francis parkman has discouraged historians from writing about the french and indian war (seven year's war). whatever the reason it's good to see from the publication of several books that americans are taking a renewed interest in the pre-revolutionary period when the british were triumphant and the indians still counted as a political force. it's past time for a thorough revision of parkman -- who was ungenerous with the indians although i thrilled as a young reader to his descriptions of their ferocity -- for example the insensate fury of the iroquois. actually the iroquois were less insensate than they were astute. calloway omits the bloody details and vivid writing of parkman but he gives us a thorough picture of what happened in the wake of the english victory over the french in north america. in particular he focuses on the frontier and the built-in conflict of american settlers british policy and the indian tribes who either went down to defeat with the french or were betrayed by perfidious albion. they made their point however in pontiac's war and by clearing white settlers from the frontier. but their numbers were declining and they would soon be overwhelmed. this is a good book about the issues of the frontier between whites and indians. in addition there's a good account of the french movement from canada to louisiana and the spanish rule in florida and the trans-mississippi. smallchief ",positive

" deyoung begins by relating how bush pushed powell out at the end of his 1st term without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him; making matters worse was the fact that bush didn't even know why powell was at the white house when it came time to say good bye. colin powell came from jamaican parents (often called jewmaicans by american negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education) and during his early life in the nyc area suffered little if any racial prejudice. later on unfortunately the insults were quite aggravating but powell was determined to not let them inhibit his performance. powell was an indifferent student in high school and at ccny (majored in geology); however rotc piqued his sophomore-year interest and he soon became a standout. powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet and top graduate (or very close) in every military training setting he undertook as well as a top mba student at george washington university. he also was top-ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment leading to his being offered a white house fellowship which in turn provided powell with travel to russia and china and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward powell onto chairman of the joint chiefs national security advisor and secretary of state. one of powell's secrets of success was to enthusiastically implement all orders even those he considered silly - powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others. unfortunately powell eventually crossed paths with dick cheney (a bit of a problem during gulf war i; a serious problem when cheney became v.p.). between cheney's far-right bias (out on the looney fringe - per powell) and bush ii's disturbingly disjointed decision-making - per treasury secretary o'neill) powell's contributions as secretary of state were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded - often with don rumsfeld's help. in addition he was often left out of important decisions especially when out of the country. ultimately powell's credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his u.n. speech attesting to saddam's wmd. the big question still debated is why didn't he resign? his supporters believe the reason is that powell's nature simply didn't allow anything less than 100% support. bottom line: if cheney had not been such an ideologue (telling bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his v.p. - ignoring powell and then sliding into the position himself) powell would be v.p. today possibly president in 2008. similarly if bush #41 had not been so stubborn and instead replaced quayle with powell in '92 powell might well have become first v.p. and then president ",positive
" as with many of the for dummies series controlling cholesterol is a well-executed overview of many issues relevant to cholesterol. author carol rinzler's light and humorous discussion ranges from a concise description of what cholesterol is to many of the different approaches to lowering cholesterol and why target values for cholesterol can differ in different people. there's an especially helpful discussion on the effects of various popular diets like atkins' sugar busters and protein power -- pluses and minuses of each. ten cholesterol myths in chapter 16 is a great discussion that can help clear up much of the murkiness surrounding cholesterol issues and can help answer many of the questions that i am asked when treating cholesterol in my patients (in my cardiology practice). one criticism: like all books about cholesterol controlling cholesterol for dummies gives the reader the impression that high cholesterol is the only way to identify risk for heart disease as well as a means of diminishing risk of heart attack. this is patently untrue but not really a criticism of this book as it is of the standard thinking on cholesterol. there are better ways! nonetheless this book does serve its intended purpose very well: educate the reader thoroughly on the conventional understanding of cholesterol.

" i have only read the swedish translation of what i suppose is the old edition but judging by look inside this book this new english-language edition incorporates much material from the old. incidentally the swedish edition gives the authors name as kallistos ware apparently his taken orthodox name while timothy ware is his original given name. in sweden the swedish translation of the orthodox church is the only readily available book on the history of the orthodox church. apparently its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on church history. it also contains chapters on theology and worship. in my opinion the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in orthodox church history. its first chapters summarize the history of this church during the byzantine empire under islam and in russia both before and during communism. of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the catholic-orthodox split usually dated to 1054. the author believes that the so-called fourth crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split. however the book must also be read with some reservations. the author is after all an orthodox christian himself. its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there. for instance ware denies that the byzantine church was caesaropapist a very untenable suggestion. at other times he is surprisingly liberal for an orthodox. for instance he paints mehmet fatih the muslim conqueror of constantinople as a very tolerant ruler. i also wonder about his interpretation of the church father cyprian. even so the orthodox church remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable christian church.

" david baldacci has a knack for writing fiction that sucks you in and holds you no matter what the story. part of the talent is to introduce interesting characters. this book is no exception. sara evans is a clerk working for a supreme court justice. she is quite close to another clerk (michael fiske) who works for a different judge. michael asks sara to marry him but sara really loves michael's brother john who sara has only seen once and never officially met. michael comes across an appeal that intrigues him (to say exactly why would be a spoiler and it is only revealed very late in the book as to exactly what intrigued him) so much that he pulls it out before it is filed and goes to visit the requestor. that happens to be a rufus harms who is serving a life sentence in an army prison for murdering a girl. when michael goes to see harms practically all hell breaks loose and harms realizes he is in danger himself and some mysterious evil guys from the prison murder michael. apparently there was some secrets in harms appeal that some powerful unknown men do not want known. michael's murder is investigated by his brother john (an ex-cop who is now a defense lawyer for the lowest of the low criminals) and he enlists the aid of sara who was close to michael and knows some things about michael. sara is instantly in love with john and the more they start investigating the more they put their lives at risk from the unknown powerful men. additionally the police start to suspect john of the murder of his brother especially when he is named as the sole beneficiary of michael's life insurance. meanwhile rufus harms has escaped prison from some of those men that tried to kill him. so we have tension throughout to see if rufus will survive as well as john and sara before the evil guys get them. there is a lot of good information about what goes on behind the scenes at the supreme court. a good rea ",positive

" this book still does not address many areas i find interesting in james brown's career but i find it a natural companion to the three other jb books in my collection: cynthia rose's living in america: the soul saga of james brown; geoff brown's biography james brown; and ofcourse the brown/tucker the godfather of soul - james brown. all three dig deep into this metaphysical musician's mind but this one has a stronger narrative a bit less guarded: his late '80s fall is described in a more contrite way for example. his scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue - but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men then immediately moves on to the next thought. even by 2005 standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality obviously directed at the female fans ever recorded. similarly his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap/hip-hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit self-righteous: there is alot of adult content in his catalogue which can't be explained away as art. however fans can trace his development into more cerebral music with more and more sensitive ballads and socially-conscious tunes being produced from the late '60s on. i was happy to read his description of little richard's assistance in his early career but a bit disheartened when he suggested that penniman was basically a rock and roll raver - i find it hard to believe that this publication brought out his true feelings about his georgia neighbor - the influence is quite obvious and not just on chonnie on chon. another depressing ommission is with marva whitney his popular lead female vocalist from c.'67 to '70. a recent documentary reveals that marva traveled to vietnam with the star but here he simply says that he was only allowed to travel with a small part of his musical backup. despite the above concerns with this book james brown has shown the literary world that he is a writer. ofcourse this was obvious to the musical world - just listen to don't be a drop out i don't want nobody to give me nothing the man in the glass i'm not demanding it's christmas time and peace in the world ",positive
" the story is both true and extremely unique: the author who is an austrian mountaineer and a ss nazi officer at the same time escapes from a british pow camp in india with the goal to go through tibet to japan-occupied burma to be sent back to germany so as not to miss his chance to participate in wwii. the extreme difficulties of hiding from officials and surviving the wintry elements of the himalaya mountains make his burma plan impossible so he stays in tibet. his unthinkable achievements include storming his way into the forbidden city (lhassa the capital) gaining employment in the tibetian government becoming a friend of the god-king dalai lama - an extremely bright knowledge-hungry teenager and learning the tibetian language to the degree which anable him to do live interpretation for dalai lana of english-language movies (believe me it is not easy for a german to translate shakespearian english into tibetian). going with a yak through the snows of the 20000-feet himalayan passes escaping merciless robbers manouvering between border guards - make seven years in tibet a great adventure book. however the insightful and rich observations about tibetian people customs culture and politics go far beyond any other available information on that far-away country and dalai-lama's foreword to this book confirms this fact. the peaceful and friendly life and culture of tibet is raped by military annexation of tibet by china in 1951. the ancient monasteries are destroyed the puritan-like culture is replaced by such crude elements of civilization as e.g. brothels for the occupying soldiers dalai lama twice escapes to india and so does the author; one third of the tibetians die of starvation. seven tears ib tibet allows us a bitter-seet inside into see a country that lived the way how countries in medieval times lived; also the country trampled and largely destroyed by its aggressive neighbour.

" as a history major (undergrad) and former high school history teacher i marvel at crichton's ability book after book to research a topic down to the bone then flesh it out in an utterly believable and compelling way. for this reason the great train robbery is for me my favorite crichton work even though it may lack the polish of jurassic park or congo or one of his more recent books. tgtr takes us to 19th century london and gives us a plausible behind the scenes look both at the masterminding of this incredible train robbery as well as life in general in 19th century london. so often history books give names dates connections but leave one with the question yes but what was it like? crichton answers this better than any book i ever read on the sheep enclosure act or most any other dry text. some of it may be fanciful but it certainly seemed as well supported as many another full blown history text. at any rate i highly recommend this book for any crichton fan master criminal fan or interested history student. the main character whose name escapes me alone is a grand study and reminiscent of a larger than life character from a hugo or dumas novel. very fascinating and rapidly moving.

" when i was in the sixth grade we moved twice and in all three of the schools from new jersey to connecticut to japan i got to study ancient greece in the history part of the class. i also got a lot of mileage out of having read edith hamilton's mythology (i still have my mythology report with my versions of all of the illustrations). but in all the times i got to study ancient greece before during and after the sixth grade i never got to do any of the fun stuff that avery hart & paul mantell come up with for ancient greece!: 40 hands-on activities to experience this wondrous age. this kaleidoscope kids volume for kids ages 7-12 not only offers activities but also a variety of information about the ancient greeks. so this is not simply a book of activities that teachers can pick and choose from to give their students hands-on experiences it is also a source of facts and stories that will supplement what exists in whatever textbook is being used. throughout the book there are great greeks! and things to think about. after reminding young readers of the gifts that have come down to us from ancient greece hart and mantell get students acclimated to the idea of looking at the past from the perspective of those who lived way back when. then the book looks at key periods of greek history. meet the minoans: the pre-greeks of crete looks at the culture that gave rise to the greatness of greece with activities to make a greek yo-yo a great mother figure a hamster labyrinth (without the minotaur) and a fantastic fresco. that gives you an indication of the sort of activities to be found in this book before we even get to greece itself. other chapters are devoted to the age of heroes where you get a super-short version of the iliad and can build a trojan horse language unites! (including speaking pig greek) the dawn of a golden age where you can organize a pentathlon and make a victory wreath and ye gods! greek religion and mythology where you can design your own constellation. in the last part of the book chapters cover classical athens: the flower of ancient civilization where you get to build a greek temple with ionic columns (or even build the entire parthenon) think for yourself: philosophy where students can make a monochord or hold a symposium and the amazing arts which covers create sculptures and painting pots in the first part and making masks to make up a greek play in the second part. the final chapter covers a wider world: alexander the great and the hellenistic age where you can start a library. at the end students can appreciate how being a greek meant standing in the center of the world (as least as far as the ancient greeks were concerned). again there are some key issues to be discussed to go along with the activities. students can debate what is the difference between a hero and a celebrity understand why every vote counts in a democracy and decide what makes somebody beautiful. learning how to press olives or how huge blocks of marble were transported across the sea gives students an appreciation for how things were different way back when. throughout the book hart and mantell show how ancient ideas live on in modern traditions which remains the biggest legacy of the ancient greeks. i teach classical greek & roman mythology (not to be confused with modern greek & roman mythology apparently) but i teach it online so i do not really have any opportunities to have my students engage in hands-on activities. but that does not mean i cannot do them in the privacy of my own home or that elementary school teachers will not find these extremely useful for their unit on ancient greece. although i am suddenly reminded of coming up with the sparthens (a.k.a. the warriors with the brains) in elementary school. but that is another story ",positive

" while peter jay fernandez and jay o. sanders aren't the only actors to narrate the acclaimed cross series they certainly are among the finest. with a host of television appearances to his credit (law & order cosby) massachusetts born hernandez has also made his mark on broadway in jelly's last jam and the merchant of venice. his voice has a tad of huskiness which makes it all the more appealing as cross. in all fernandez has been featured in almost 12 of the alex cross tales so he well knows the characters and easily inhabits each scene. to date jay o. sanders has narrated over 50 audio books and he's a perfect voice partner for fernandez. his experience includes off-broadway roles in shakespearean plays which may account for his remarkably clear diction and easy listening tone. the voices of fernandez and sanders complement one another as they bring one of the most compelling cross stories to life. it's a painful attention-getter when we listen again to how cross lost his beloved wife maria - she was shot down before his eyes. her killer was never found; the case chalked off as another sick drive-by shooting. now cross has returned to being a psychologist his children are thriving and perhaps he may be able to love someone again. however a telephone call from john sampson his old partner changes all that. sampson wants cross's help in finding a psychopathic serial rapist on the loose in georgetown. of course cross can't say no but little did he realize that this investigation would lead him to a tie-in to maria's death some years ago. one more rapid paced thriller from the amazing pen of james patterson read by two consummate voice performers. - gail cook ",positive

" great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity. though edited by bob blaisdell who presumably provides the single-paragraph introductions the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day. their messages speak for themselves. a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections. one is their brevity. the speakers get to the point and make it clearly. few inclusions run longer than five pages. there is also a level of genuine (and often sad) honesty. many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians' efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation if such a thing was possible at the time. the tone is often one of resignation but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners. it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed rightly or wrongly the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat. even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts. the style could almost be considered anti-oratorical though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own. one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english. nonetheless the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people separated by years language and geography who retain a clear-headed means of addressing their listeners ",positive
" set in venice at the end of world war ii hemingway tells a romantic and touching story of the love affair between a gruff 50 year old american colonel and renata a young and very pretty italian contessa. loss is a recurring theme--the death of many of the colonel's subordinates in combat the break-up of his earlier marriage to a career woman and the severe injury to one of the colonel's hands from which he suffers constant pain. the colonel may also be dying and his time left with his young lover may be very short. what gives the novel so much poignancy and resonance is the great devotion renata and the colonel have for one another. renata seeks to comfort the colonel and implores him to relate to her the worst of his combat experiences so that he may relieve some of his bitterness. the colonel lovingly calls renata daughter. hemingway tells this tale in the deceptively simple direct and matter of fact style for which he is justly celebrated. i could have done without the duck hunting sequences and some of the colonel's more obvious macho behavior but hemingway being hemingway understandably could not. this is a lovely and sad story filled with the yearnings of its two lead characters ",positive

(when my wife saw the movie she remarked that holly was an idiot.) however the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting and the book's ending is more intriguing. the movie ends as a love story. the book is much more. and oh yes whatever you may think of capote as an individual the guy was a damn good writer ",positive
" always lively and perspicacious this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle: while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations (weapons diseases horses etc.) for why europeans spread so thickly into north america australia new zealand and argentina (the lands crosby labels neo-europes) what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well? the question doesn't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion but the european housefly and feral pigs and a horde of other weeds pests crops diseases and livestock from europe followed suit. quite often these organisms even the domesticated ones raced ahead of european explorers themselves rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom. why was this so? why didn't say australian weeds their seeds inadvertently shipped back to england eventually carpet the meadows and fields of europe? to answer this odd question professor crosby begins his story with pangaea--the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe. these seams of pangaea then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when european mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams. crosby details case after case in each category: weeds pests livestock diseases and crops. he forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear. what is the answer? he drops clues every now and then and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters: if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all. here then is the answer: all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the european diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the old world civilizations--and they in turn furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium. together--humans horses cattle pigs rats clover peaches measles and yes dandelions--comprised a potent self-replicating system dimly discerned by its contemporaries that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of pangaea ",positive

" this is one of the best business books i've ever read. mr. nocera says it took him six years to write this book and i believe it. the amount of work that went into this book is obvious. this is an excellent piece of business journalism. the annotations and bibliography are thorough and the overall writing and editing is top notch. mr. nocera covers a rich array of elements important to the development of the financial services industry over the last half of the 20th century: - automated teller machines (atms) - the bankamericard (later visa) - outdated banking regulations - black monday october 19 1987 - jimmy carter's futile attempts to wrestle runaway inflation in the late 1970's - cash management accounts (cmas) - citibank (later citicorp) - deregulation of brokers' commissions - growth of american consumer debt as a result of runaway inflation in the late 1970's - america's cultural adoption of the plastic credit card from the late 1950's through 1993 - the direct marketing of credit cards to americans and its great success - america's worship of star mutual fund managers like peter lynch during the 1980's - the ineptitude of america's elected officials to deregulate the banking industry in the face of dramatic changes in the financial services marketplace - the amazing impact money market mutual funds had on americans' savings strategies given the inflexibility of the banking regulation q that capped savings deposit interest at around 5% while interest rates were as high as 16%+ in the early 1980's - the significant growth and influence of fidelity investments and its leader ned johnson on the industry in the 1980's - individual retirement accounts (iras) and their impact on the growing wealth of americans - the rise of nonbank banks and other non-financial companies getting into the financial services arena during the 1970's and 1980's - the pervasive impact and presence that andrew kahr had throughout the industry in creating new financial services products - the pollyana-ish impact of marshall loeb editor of money magazine had on middle class americans and their views of investing in securities - the amazing record of peter lynch despite the ever-growing size of the magellan fund - the slowness of merrill lynch to change along with the rest of the industry in de-emphasizing commission revenue versus asset management fees - the dramatic growth of mutual funds in the later half of the 20th century and all the billions the financial services industry makes from them each year - negotiable order of withdrawal (now) accounts - state laws on usury and how south dakota became the credit card capital of america - schwab's onesource as the first 'mutual fund supermarket' - the dramatic risks of writing naked put options in 1987 just before black monday and how it impacted charles schwab & co. - the impact of reagonomics on american wealth-building - the 1980's bull market leading up to black monday - the wild success of first deposit's first select card as designed by andrew kahr and the adverse reaction to it by consumers and watchdog groups - paul volcker's anti-inflation policy of ratcheting up interest rates in the early 1980's and his general resistance to deregulation of the banking industry - ted and nina wang's amazing margin calls during and after black monday the author does a great job of depicting the very interesting characters that led the money revolution in the later half of the 20th century including dee hock of visa ned johnson of fidelity peter lynch of fidelity andrew kahr the product development consultant roger lawson of fidelity marshall loeb of money magazine charles merrill of merrill lynch president jimmy carter and his administration donald regan of merrill lynch and the reagan administration charles schwab gerald tsai jr. of fidelity paul volcker of the federal reserve and walter wriston and john reed of citibank. the writing is crisp clear and easy to read. few books come out like this and mr. nocera is to be commended for this first rate work. if you are even mildly interested in any of the items listed above you will enjoy this book. if you find the financial services industry fascinating and/or work in the industry you will love this book. it's a page turner! the only drawback to this book is that it was published over a decade ago in 1994. so much has happened since then! i encourage mr. nocera to pick up where he left off and put out a second edition that takes his readers up through 2005.

" overall i think this is a very good book for someone who is trying to turn their health habits around but is overwhelmed by all of the possibilities. it also a good track to run on for someone who wants to implement important life changes in an easy step-wise fashion. there is nothing fanatical about the recommendations and they can be easily implemented by almost anyone. one of the things i most like about this book is the encouraging tone and the prioritization of various changes that are made little-by-little in eating habits exercise etc. this book recommends walking as the main source of exercise and gives some great arguments for why this makes sense. i think there are also some good and simple nutritional guidelines e.g. eliminated trans fatty acids eating more fiber using more olive oil etc. mixed in with some well researched conclusions are dr. weil's opinions. for example he recommends a fairly simple supplementation regimen. while it is true that not everything he says is necessarily supported by corresponding studies it is also probably that some of it is on the mark but the data is not all in or all of the variables are not possible to isolate. at the least i don't see where this level of supplementation would do harm to most people. i also like that dr. weil takes a holistic approach to health. he not only looks at and talks about the body. he also addressed stress and relaxation life attitudes and other ingredients of a healthy life that impact on health. while he is very commercial he is also a harvard trained physician and i do think that he has some very good insights to share. while in some ways i think this book can be better. i would still recommend it to almost anyone especially people who are intimidated by the idea of exercising and changing their life habits. while not every suggestion might be on target i am sure that if someone implemented all the suggestions over eight weeks they would undergo a big positive change in the state of their health. i have certainly found this to be true and i cheat on some of them ; ",positive

" at first i found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a christian and a catechist in the catholic church. yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story especially since i work as a mental health professional. as i keep reading i discovered that it wasn't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child and of the intrusive nature of the media. i particularly liked the strength mariah showed during this conflict despite her past history of nervous breakdown. and i like the way the character of ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man. the secondary characters were all wonderful in particular mariah's mother and the lawyers on both side. i thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story. as with all picoult books this was a deep and heavy novel which wasn't easily breezed through but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to read!

" noah webster's book is fascinating reading for today's students and teachers alike as well as for the average citizen as there is much to learn from it. while it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an official school text it certainly has a place in every school library. one of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used with diacritical marks (accents) applied to all relevant vowels and consonants; words are divided according to syllables and stress. it also spells the names of letters of the alphabet; something which tends to be ignored in modern teaching. the terminology of traditional grammar is used and there are copious word lists with words grouped according to common factors. i have no hesitation in recommending this book to all students of the english language for the above reasons and for many other interesting aspects (now-archaisms:thy/thou...; foreign words and phrases; abbreviations explained; punctuation; etc). this book should remain a spelling classic ",positive
" thankfully this is not littered with platitudes and meaningless anaologies the hallmarks of 99% of the latest-and-greatest business books. especially since it was written in 1999 moore's is an incredibly insightful and prophetic book on strategy for the high-tech industry. he was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005. the book is much more descriptive than prescriptive though and is best used as a tool to instigate discussions about corporate strategy rather than as a checklist for strategic implementation. i help run an online software development company and although it isn't exactly high tech i still found the vast majority of it very helpful and the rest of it fascinating. market shifts are demanding broadband wireless internet everywhere--free. companies are shifting towards web-basing software applications. all very relevant to my business. the book is well written an easy and moderately fast read and very accessible by anyone who is technology-savvy enough to at least hold an email address. yes buy it. buy the paperback and save money. short synopsis: in the infancy of a market products need to be highly tailored to meet the psychological and technical needs of leading edge techno-geeks; nothing new here. when a company wants to take that product and make it marketable to the middle majority--where the biggest money sits--it requires a commitment to discipline and shift its strategy in order to do so. the emphasis shifts intially to identifying a single niche segment and creating a comprehensive tailored product that meets all of their needs--create the whole product by using partners and 3rd party services to patchwork the thing together. then stop tweaking the product. if that works pick related niches and go after them the same way creating the whole product for each of them. once people at large are comfortable enough to make the paradigm shift for that market (this all deals with new high-tech changes) and start doing so en masse the strategy must completely shift again to a ship-first / fix-the-product-later mentality in a mad market share scramble. at this phase you are in the tornado. lots of examples of successful and abysmal strategies used by high tech companies whose names are familiar to everyone at each stage mentioned above.

" it doesn't sound like the people you list as reasons not to read this book actually read this book. there is a big difference in my opinion of putting positive affirmations in your mind versus a witch doctor. and quite honestly it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in conjuction with medical care. does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care because you will most definitely be healed? no where. so in my opinion one has to have a sound mind and not view the book as a cure all for all the ills in life but rather a positive way to enhance your life. it is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care when you have a terminal illness or any other illness for that matter. but according to what i gather from the book you can use positive affirmations and believe that you are getting well to help keep yourself in a positive state rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well. studies aside from this book have proven that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook have done wonders for recovering patients along with their medical care. your review did not address any of those people that read this book because the two examples of people you list it is apparent they didn't read the book either (not sure what compelled you to post here?) therefore you are not qualified in my opinion to critique this book as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist did they prescribe drinking snakes blood too? anyway this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick and those that do probably won't be addressing their medical problem. can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis? i imagine it can (studies prove it can) in addition to proper medical treatment. anyway you might want to actually read the book instead of making comments of what happened to so and so who didn't even read it or apply it including yourself.

" addressing as it does issues of cognition language usage and acquisition evolutionary biology and innate versus learned behavior this work is relevant to many of the great intellectual debates of our time. it is very readable for the most part although if some of the topics are new to you then you will find a few sections rather heavy going. more illustrations would have helped here. there are syntax structure diagrams and one very grudging cursory sketch of the language centers of the brain but many sections cry out for a diagram among all the verbiage. pinker's lively humorous style is often commented on but i sometimes found it wearing. he will illustrate a point with an amusing newspaper cutting then list a few more then add i could not resist some more... and so on. i sometimes wished he would just get on with it. a major problem with his nativist approach which other reviewers have commented on is that many examples he lists of usages that english speakers would never employ are nothing of the kind. most of them are conceivable and since the first publication of this book linguists have been busy recording them in the field. the thesis also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter where he argues that 'you and i' and 'you and me' are equally correct in all circumstances because 'the pronoun is free to have any case it wants'. but if this is so then what has become of the innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about? if 'between you and i' sounds instinctively wrong to me and 'between you and me' sounds instinctively wrong to someone else does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene? i doubt it. the title itself is problematic. 'instinct' is not a word much in favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is it is certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense. early in the book pinker admits as much but determines to use the word anyway a use that owes more to marketing than to science. still this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available. if you are new to linguistics start here rather than with chomsky but please go on to read geoffrey sampson's work perhaps starting with his website to get an alternative view. as with most academic disputes the answer no doubt lies somewhere in the middle. since chomsky's early work the nativists have toned down their claims considerably while their opponents have made concessions. on page 34 of this book pinker says no one has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene but the search is on. more than a decade later the search is still on. good luck with that.

" i read desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with the regulators also. this book is filled with suspense from page one. the book never drags in my opinion. this book though is not for the faint of heart. if you don't enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter. but if you don't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes. the ending is by far the most suspenseful part. i also recommend reading desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what tak is all about. the journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also. i wish there was a part three to this but sadly there isn't. i can't choose between desperation and regulators because their both great but the regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it. although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end. keep up the good work king ",positive
" i dedicate this review to women all around the world of all colourracesreligionsnationality and creed...(all women are equalin my eyes....nigel..) in this remarkable novelsk makes his debut.an unlikely but good book.it has a good dose of horror/suspense and it is one of the best books i have ever read... it is simply about a teenager from mainenamed carietta white(carrie).from the beginning of the story we see who her mother(margaret white)takes advantage of hermaking her feel stupid and left out.similiarly in schoolcarrie is always the black sheepshe has not friends and she is always picked upon.she is very unusual and strangeat least to most peopleespecially the ones in the book(story).(but i would say quite frankly that i didn't see here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl.) at the beginning of the story we also see that carrie has her first period while taking a shower at school.she is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at her.this is her first big humiliation.(i am a guyi know not much about a periodso please forgive my use of the term openly) anywayback to the plot:carrie soon realizes that she is psychic.she starts to practice using her powers gradually.it seems as though she had the powers since birthbut the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it. soso far we see this:a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother. the story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end. allow me..... it is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic.carrie's mother explains alot of thingsbut she is still a bad mother. (but i still can't hate carries's motherbecause most mothers are sort of protective over their children) soon carrie gets her first friend sue.sue feels sorry for carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom. this date is tommy ross... meanwhileone of the bad girlschrisis unable to attend the prom.soshe sets up a nasty revenge against carrie.believe me when i tell youchris is a very jealous girl and if she can't have somethingno one else canespecially carrie. so chris arranges a trap for carrie.(two buckets of pig blood) she sets it up for the pig blood to fall on carrie's and tommy's head while at the prom... the plan eventually succeeds. tommy is badly injured. drenched in pig's bloodcarrie is laughed atfor the last time.she runs out of the building.she then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge. she starts to close all the doors.she then turns on all the water sprinklerswetting everyone. but with a combination of water and electricity(from the appliances)....some were electrocuted. eventually a fire gets started.and things start to burn! she walks toward her homeburning everything within a certain radius of her powers. when she reaches home her mother tries to kill hertelling her that she is the spawn of satan.she eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers' heart beatkilling her. eventually(this is the good part of the book)while carrie is walking on the streets(going i don't know where)she seens chris and chris's boyfriend driving towards herto bounce her. carrie uses her powers to diverge to carkilling chris and her stupid boyfriend. sue eventually catches up with carrie.carrie doesn't kill her because she realizes that it wasn't sue's falt but chris's. (during the battle with her mothercarrie was stabbedi forgot to mention itsorry.) sonowtalking with sue carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and justdies.(this is the sad parti guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyesor maybe not) but this book is definitely goodi recommend it with all my psychic powers. enjoy.............this review was written by nigel....

" i've skimmed a number of popular books published in the last few years on the problem of sexless marriage and this is by far most interesting contribution to date. first there is no recommendations for drug therapy anywhere in the book. second the author frequently brings into the discussion a european-influenced view of some particularly american style predilictions and assumptions reguarding sex parenthood gender politics and relationship expectations. her fundamental premise is that eroticisim requires seprateness and in the course of building and sustaining security we can frequently lose the me and you in us. but even more important she sees the very contemporary marital impulse toward an egalitarian union -- while great for chores and child care -- can be a neutralizer in the bedroom. you may or may not find strands of your own dilemma in her case histories but you will not walk away from them empty handed either. there are many aspects of the book which are highly nuanced and won't survive well in the o'reilly world of broadcast media interviews. i can just hear some producer-fed talking head asking something like you advocate couples go to vegas for swinging? why? (she doesn't). so don't pay attention to that noise. this is an intellegent respectful contemplative work of original thinking that confronts a subject too often approached with superlatives and pabulum. buy one for yourself and one for your best friend -- more than likely they're suffering too ",positive

" first published in 1936 this is the 12th poirot book the 3rd superintendent battle book and the 2nd colonel race book and has no narrator. it's the first case in which superintendent battle mrs. oliver or col. race appear together with poirot or each other and the only case in which *all* do so at once. the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes where poirot encounters mr. shaitana a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip. shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he's a victim waiting to happen. for shaitana like a few other collectors in christie's universe has succumbed to a foolish temptation and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius but murderers. and being a connoisseur he collects only the best: those who have gotten away with it. he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby without naming names and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of tigers (poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger but would do so from outside the tiger's cage having respect for the danger.) poirot accepts the supper invitation however to find that there are seven other guests including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers: explorer major despard a strong silent type; mrs. lorrimer a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge; timid young anne meredith; and dr. roberts a loud and jovial general practitioner. shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder but otherwise the subject does not come up and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players! this is of course poirot's fantasy case as he once remarked in the abc murders - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another. there are only the people themselves and their memories of the evening and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed. solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved. but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they'd committed and gotten away with? rather than following poirot's viewpoint in third person throughout some chapters follow battle race or mrs. oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case. each represents a different style: battle is a professional police officer race an empire-builder-type secret agent and mrs. oliver a writer of detective stories. battle of course has a duty to investigate shaitana's murder and does so in an orthodox style cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him. race deals with checking out major despard the explorer who's most clearly his kind of person. mrs. oliver for her part works on worming information out of not only anne meredith but her roommate rhonda (whose attitude is that anne could've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she'd been paying attention). and of course there's poirot. he's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn pursuing two major lines of questioning: (1) describe how the bridge games played out and (2) describe the scene of the murder (the elaborate collector's room in shaitana's house where the bridge games were played). see if you can figure out where poirot's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues and what he learned from the responses he received ",positive

" the purpose of nessus is to provide an open source solution for network auditing on all unix like systems. this book not only details using nessus but also comes with a cd containing the program as well as ethereal snort and newt (a port of the program to the windows environment). what is a network assessment? at its basic level it is an attempt to detect a live system and then identify the computing environment services applications and vulnerabilities on that system. basically there are two types of assessment - internal and external. an internal assessment is done over the local network and external is done from outside the lan. nessus will do both types and the book details how to do either or both of them. the authors do an excellent job of detailing installation setup and how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors that can affect the report. one of the parts not to be missed is the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential problems of scanning your system. some of the vulnerability types scanned for include buffer overflows default passwords backdoors information leaks and denial of service. the nessus scripting language is covered in detail in appendix a instead of the main portion of the book; a choice i appreciated very much as it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a highly technical section. with open source products there generally is no organized technical support phone number you can call of help. so the authors include information on how to get help via the nessus user community mailing lists and archives. nessus network auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in auditing their network to find potential problems before they become reality ",positive

" did you ever know someone whose life was just perfect ?? someone who went to college got married at age 23 found a great job with valuable stock options... someone who settled down in a house in a nice city at age 25 or 26 started a family a year or two later and who now seems to have it all ?? well after world war ii this happened to just about everyone in the silent generation and it happen to most in the boomer generation and it's happening to just about no one in generation x. this books speaks to members of generation x and describes the suffering and coping mechanisms for these people. this book now 15 years is about a generation that was sold down the river by its elders - generation x. the book describes 3 young people andy dag and claire who visit palm springs and tell stories of their lives and of their friends who are suffering in life. the author douglas coupland is actually telling stories from vancouver british columbia one of the first cities in north america to be sold out to foreign economic colonizers from hong kong (who escaped to vancouver to avoid the 1997 mainland takeover.) in this city the worst 1100 square foot fixer-upper house costs a third of a million dollars or 10 years of take-home pay for a mid-career household. economic success is impossible in the physical confines of the city - the system is rigged against everyone except rich immigrants and the existing upper class of blue-collar boomers who purchased homes in the 1970's and 1980's. many aspects of the book (such as reverse sabbatical mcjobs etc.) reflect the severe economic conditions faced by high-achieving intellectuals who go nowhere economically in that city. in my grandparents generation all you had to do was to go to college. in my parent's generation you needed to go to college and become a successful professional. in my own generation you need to co-found a startup company and be among the 10% of founders who can sell off the company or have an ipo. do you notice something here? yes it's getting more and more difficult to be marginally successful in america. because gen x'ers find that traditional paths to success - hard work taking chances saving and investing - don't work any more they resolve to live like their parents by either living with their parents or by borrowing money endlessly and hoping for a miracle. fiscal irresponsibility is at an all-time high and has squandered everyone's future! in this environment of perpetual economic slavery coupland counsels generation x'ers to break free of the traditional career models that have been rigged by their elders for failure. coupland counsels us all to re-examine what is success in our life and how to achieve it. this book is a call to enlist in a class warfare between gen-x'ers and their elders! in many ways this book is similar to the razor's edge by w. somerset maughen or the monk and the riddle: the art of creating a life while making a living in other words redefine your notion of success in the world while waiting for our evil society to implode in upon itself which must surely happen in the near future ..

" i was a little wary about the title but this was not at all about weight gain and/or loss; weight was incidental. in this fiercely intelligent novel dorothy and justine are both desperately lonely women both victims of abuse and yet are different in other ways. their parents often failed them their childhood was often full of shame and self-sabotage but gaitskill writes this with complexity always aware that a victim can also be a victimizer. gaitskill is never sentimental. underneath her narrative underneath the pain and the sex scenes (which are never fully loving) and the disappointments and loneliness is a raging anger at the inability of human beings to connect - on race on class but mostly on gender. i sensed that anna granite the intellectual whose shadow dominates this narrative and who is the reason dorothy and justine first meet is gaitskill's platform for displaying her keen intellect; and sometimes there is a hint of didactism. but this is a minor quibble. the last section moved me very much and proved that although gaitskill abhors sentimentality she can certainly do sentiment well. `humanity' is a word often found in this book. our sexuality is connected to our humanity. our ability to treat other human beings like human beings is what makes us human. in the end gaitskill's brilliant wonderfully feminist novel was for me about how easily we strip each other of our humanity.

" firstly i have not seen the film adaptation of 'single white female' and so this review isn't tainted one way or the other. this book about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate is written is very easy style. characterizations prose and dialogue are all straightforward. i can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel. and the book's feel is anything but original. 'sliver' by ira levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life (and danger) in manhattan for a single white female. still 'single white female' is an entertaining read. bottom line: a very enjoyable suspenseful read that doesn't tax the brain. recommended ",positive
" walzer's historical approach to examining just war theory is i think the most useful way to understand morality in war. that is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations. walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying if not prescribing moral norms from which the rules have been extracted. be forewarned he does not cut the reader any slack. this book requires some serious attention to the author's train of thought. just war theory has two categories: the justice of going to war and the justice of fighting once in a war. walzer's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere. in doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service. his logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war. one of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that all is fair in love and war. that is the path of least moral resistance (or as clausewitz would say friction) yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers. what is amazing from the discusion is the realization that walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected. yet it remains a prevailing idea for many. originally coined by the romans it seems (walzer quotes them in war the laws are silent) they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the greeks and carthginians. the book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone. some make the mistake of thinking walzer is a pacifist--far from it. on the otherside some critics find his argument about supreme emergency a moral failure and a cop-out. the case of nazi germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency one where normal rules may be relaxed if ever so little because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide. the same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to islamic terror. in contrast walzer does not see imperial japan for instance as having represented a supreme emergency and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified. readers may want to compare his view to paul fussell's perspective in the essay thank god for the atom bomb. significantly for current events readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here. the us attack on iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive. that impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects i think a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy. there is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of pre-emption. michael walzer's well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and islamic radicalism and it clearly shows why the iraq war was a moral mistake from the start regardless of its practical success down the road if we are fortunate enough to see that. the moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt america long into the future. the fact that iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco. where one fails to recognize the moral high ground one is doomed to moral failure. walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003 and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the iraq invasion; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world's police force ",positive
" malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail. i really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs/matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books. he almost makes the process seem easy and maybe it is if you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant. however much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a plateau'ed or downward spiraling church that has been around for 100 years. the principles are easy and make sense if you have 100% support of the congregation. that's pretty hard to do in most of the churches i've been in that need strategic planning the most. that's no fault of malphurs; the book itself is a great book ",positive

" this is a charming little book. it's very concise profusely illustrated and it covers the basic geometry of platonic and archimedean solids. it delightfully summarizes the work of plato/theaetetus archimedes euclid kepler and euler in only 57 pages half of which contain only illustrations. as a model-builder who attaches no special religious significance to polyhedra i was a little concerned when i looked at the other books in the series that this book might be about sacred geometry. fortunately (at least from my point of view) it does not contain a word about it except for a cursory reference to the elements plato associated with each of the platonic solids. a table at the end includes the dihedral and central angles and edge/radius ratios for all the platonic and archimedean solids--all the info a model builder needs! this book won't impress anyone with a mathematics background but for a layman like me it's a perfect introduction. kudos to sutton for putting this material in such an elegant and accessible format ",positive
" in this book dulles offers a simplistic yet useful overview of the way the church has been viewed throughout its history. he focuses primarily on the catholic church. from dulles' analysis there are five basic ways to understand the church. he explores how these models have been used over time as well as their particular strengths and weaknesses. in the rest of the book dulles explores some of the issues surrounding ecclesiology. he has also added a new model which is a synthesis of the other five. my only complaint about the book is that it makes divisions too simple and straightforward. rarely is there a church that fits all of the descriptions of one model or does not somehow combine several models. the book is helpful however to pastors who seek to understand the thought patterns of the members of their church. it is also helpful to congregants who desire to understand more fully what it means to be the church. all things considered this book is an asset to pastors students and anyone involved in ministry ",positive

" private eye philip marlowe is asked for help to get to mexico by terry lennox. marlowe likes lennox and agrees to help him but later lennox commits suicide in the small mexican town of otatoclan. but why was lennox driven to such extremes? later on marlowe is asked for his assistance in keeping the alcoholic writer roger wade on the staight-and-narrow. this is not really marlowe's line of work but he becomes entangled in the case especially as connections with lennox begin slowly to emerge. this is a longer more ambitious novel by chandler albeit displaying the same cynical tough edge as the other marlowe novels i've read. the greater length allows chandler more space for character development and reflection. the danger of this is that the novel could have felt over-extended but for me it didn't. the ending did not come as a total surprise but as with every other chandler novel i've read enjoyment of the journey rather than satisfaction at the quality of the destination is the important thing. g rodger ",positive
" elaine pagels is a wonderful writer. her explanation into early christianity is wonderful. it is definitely worth the time to read this. she delves into the politics of the early church the passion the resurrection as well as the clashes between gnostic and orthodox thinking. too often we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available. she just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another. if you want to get an idea of who the gnostics were read this ",positive

" this book is a somewhat linear history of the past 13000 years across the continents. diamond seeks to sum up history across various societies on all the continents in a relatively short volume. the impetus for this search starts with a question from a friend of his from new guinea named yali. yali's question was why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to new guinea but we black people had little cargo of our own? reading the book i think i gulped at this point. this sounds like a classic loaded question. it sounds disturbingly close to why have we (europe and its former colonies) succeeded where they have failed. diamond does not descend into that territory though but he does not evade criticism for skirting it completely. there are references to a culture's success in industrializing or condensing populations that diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing for instance. the advantages of a hunting/gathering culture are not really explored outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast asia. this history can probably be described (or perhaps is most successful) as based around environmental causation (as opposed to the racial/ethnic/social causation that the lump in my throat had been fearing). descriptions of climate (note: that the history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age) longitudinal or latitudinal axes elevation and landmass differences play a strong role in determining the fate of humanity. still it is interesting to look specifically at the items gathered in the title. guns. europe's refinement of this technology was based on china's innovations with gunpowder. today's dominant society is a product as much of what it has swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated. as an interesting counterpoint japan had owned more and better guns in c. 1600 ce than any country in the world. samurai rulers first limited then outlawed the technology. japan wouldn't resume manufacture until mid 19th century. obviously there is an indisputable importance in the weaponry's influence in shaping the geopolitical world of today. germs. epidemics left people from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and those dense populations more easily replaced those who didn't survive. smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger cities. epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs jump over from domesticated animals (and smaller groups may not even have animals to domesticate). interesting note: the emperors of the mayan and incan civilizations both succumb to disease (likely smallpox) rather than guns. steel. technological advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense populations and the possibility for abstraction of responsibilities. a hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such developments as literacy and mining as the energies that would fuel these are directed toward survival areas. diamond makes an interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary necessity over civilized society where the evolutionary energy may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses. there are many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for the development of these things. first there appears to need to be sustainable farming. many of the staples of modernity are the crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region (where today we invade suck oil and force the conquered to endure freedom). the western asian breadbasket provided the means to bank food so that trades could develop. as a complete side note the genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this filter as it goes into great detail how joseph set up a system of storing and meting grain in egypt to greatly increase the population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought on by sustenance farming. another factor in the civilizing of eurasia is the landmass itself. compared to africa and the americas eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south. movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more easily occur because climate differences are easier on a latitudinal basis than on longitudinal. something like corn (maize) which was domesticated in central americas took a very long time to make it to north america because of geography. llamas and guinea pigs (which could be useful for pack animals and food) never made it north. conversely all those fertile crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle horses pigs were able to spread from one tip of asia to the opposite tip of europe. to answer yali's question some of the answer is luck. africa australia and the americas may not have been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that eurasia had. some other is environmental determinism where you are helps make up who you become. for going forward diamond cites transportation communication and information advances as factors that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future. after word: harpers magazine tackles an issue that was brought up but not as fully developed here that of pre-clovis native american discoveries (pronouncements) knowingly confronting a loaded racial/ethnocentric question in a folio called might white of you: are american archaeologists white supremacists? the archaeological records supports people living in the americas since about 9000-11000 bce. there are scant scraps of evidence prior to that date but plenty of theories typically more titillating than substantive. one wonders if the pre-clovis discovery (especially all the business about caucusoid skulls) isn't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined genocide to justify a documented genocide.

" as china re-emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world. oddly the fascism of the communist regime remains largely in place in the era following mao's disastrous reign even as capitalism and other western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge heavily-populated and (from a western perspective)oftentimes strange land. aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of christianity in china as well as introducing readers to the many chinese christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country. on a recent trip to china i was highly impressed by the deep generosity humility resourcefulness strength perseverance and kindness exhibited by chinese of all ages. this spirit hums just below the surface in the stories aikman tells of the christian chinese and their faith. this spirit is also i believe one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many chinese. also those who are concerned that a christian china would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy. it seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly chinese way ",positive

" this book unlike morris's work on hillary is actually worth reading because its perspective and analysis of our 42nd president is fascinating. though the title is a little tiresome (and becomes especially so when morris continues to say throughout the book `why? because he could!') the book is a fast page turner. i particularly enjoyed morris's portrayal of clinton as one who only came to life around other people: if they were happy he was if they were in distress he felt their pain. a master of reading people and changing according to their feelings clinton was perfectly suited to becoming a president who ruled by polls. enter dick morris. as clinton's chief poller he also became at one time his chief political advisor. and clinton needed one. as `my life' by clinton shows the president had no overall strategy and failed to see events as interconnected. for him each issue needed to be examined individually and with clinton that was a laborious endeavor: the prez had the painful habit of considering each argument with equal weight and therefore was extremely indecisive and cautious to take action. result? fiasco's like waco somalia bosnia and health care reform. more seriously for the future: the loss of the congress to the republicans (over ten years now and counting) and the failure to stop bin laden. morris gives credit where credit is due though: clinton's work on welfare reform cut the roll books in half and the tough work on deficit reduction allowed the economic boom of the 1990s to take place. also interesting was clinton's use of the presidency as a bully pulpit for families and education: an issue that was local politics and therefore cost clinton nothing in the budget but brought in massive political capital. read this book before reading clinton's `my life'. why? because morris points out the inconsistencies and just plain untruths contained therein. also morris says that the president's autobiography is the `rosetta stone' that decodes clinton. if that is the case then morris is certainly the interpreter.

" here's a good litmus test to show how good a book like breathing lessons is--nothing extraordinary happens and yet i did not want to put the book down. there are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret. there are no car chases explosions sex scenes (barely even any kissing) or exotic locations. no one changes or has an epiphany. almost nothing happens--maggie and ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter-in-law but nothing changes at all. to the average reader this book probably would seem really dull. heck if someone told me the plot of this book i'd think it was really dull too but i didn't want to put it down. the reason is that maggie and ira are so well-drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people i know or could know. i think i could go to the supermarket and run into maggie and ira that's how real they seemed to me. i suppose ther reason is that tyler allows me as the reader to know just about everything regarding these two characters and their two personalities just come through so transparently in the story that they don't seem like characters acting their parts; they seem like real people. because of this even though very little happens to maggie or ira and even though neither of them changes by the end of the book i cared so much about them that i wanted to keep reading right through the end so i breezed through the novel in a few days. in all honesty what i really appreciate about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything i've ever read about how to write a book. this is purely a character-driven novel with very little plot except for the death of maggie's friend's husband that gets the ball rolling. everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of maggie's personality more than any artificially-generated plot twists. it's hard for me to find any real faults with this book except for the lengthy flashback near the end that perhaps goes on too long. some people may call this boring or dull but i would call it purely exceptional. i loved this book and highly recommend it ",positive

" i loved the core knowledge curriculum. the reason i switched my children to a charter school is that they started out teaching ck. i also switched them back to the public school when the principal got away from ck and made it just like a public school. i agree that a teacher should supplement what is in the ck books to give their students a better understanding of the material. teaching the information exactly how it is presented in the books would be very dry. however ck is a great outline of what should be taught. it covers a tremendous amount of knowledge including the fight for civil rights all religious ideology multicultural literature and more. if there is a problem with the books it is that many children would not be motivated to learn the wide variety of topics covered. for many it would be too much. also weak teachers would be overwhelmed trying to cover everything. hence anyone claiming that ck supports a racist philosophy has never read the books. also i want to point out that the reviewer who called the books racist misspelled the word. it is not spelled rasist. i also find it disturbing that the reviewer is supposedly a teacher. when attending school maybe that teacher would have benefited from a core knowledge foundation.

" polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant radical and all too plausible theory in this book. going beyond a mere analysis of how the market system functions polanyi endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about. polanyi's answer will not be pleasing to libertarians he argues that a free land and labor market can only come about through government intervention and must be sustained through further intervention. he also argues that the market ransforms the nature of social relations. usually economic relations were a result of social relations under the market it is the latter. polanyi attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in britain. his argument that government enclosures created it through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources of economic production is convincing. however other arguments polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government repealing the interventions of subaltern governments. polanyi's argument that there was no rent-seeking (he doesn't use that term) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy (proving that this intervention was objectively necessary is suspect. one 19th century investigators conclusions don't serve to overturn the implications of public choice theory. the greatest problem with this book is that polanyi doesn't do too much to back up his arguments. he fortunately has a section called notes and sources where he lists his research material but i'd wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years later ",positive

" clinton's old friend and key russia advisor provides insight on a number foreign policy topics as they evolve. as deputy secretary of state his accounts provide personal scholarly and practical accounts. the reader might determine both that talbott was an invaluable resource as the post-cold war era evolved and that in the end clinton was his own &quot;russia hand.&quot; the primary theme of the book is the relationship between clinton and russian president boris yeltsin. as they address issues such as nato expansion the balkans economic difficulties and each president's own personal troubles a number of lessons emerge. first great power politics takes place between human beings not merely among structural or organizational frameworks. second the blending of idealism and realism is thorough and complex they are not either-or options. third political military economic domestic and international issues all impact each other often in surprising ways. fourth watch out for the u in trying to explain policy making: in the generic y=ax+by+cz+u that u (for unexplained/unexpected) can often play a large role. the russia hand is valuable to students of foreign policy russia and u.s.-russia relations and the emergence of the post-cold war era.

" a mind-opening look into the vicious thought patterns depressed people suffer from this book has been more helpful to me than years of therapy *and* a degree in psychology. (although i'm not giving up the meds just yet). i'm amazed by how clearly yapko explains the cognitive distortions we have. the case histories he describes are priceless. on the &quot;negative&quot; side yapko can be just a bit condescending at times; it's clear he thinks his way is the only way. and although he mentions other theories of depression he favors the &quot;nurture&quot; theory of ineffective learned thought patterns claiming that only a small percentage of depression is biochemical in nature. (maybe next lifetime he'll be a woman and get to experience menopause. ;) yapko also has an unfortunate habit of calling depressed people &quot;depressives&quot; which is the kind of labeling we could do without. the most serious criticism i have is that his &quot;learn by doing&quot; exercises are sometimes impractical if not downright silly. for example to learn about perceived control yapko writes &quot;spend a few days asking [a partner] for permission to do everything such as 'can i go to the bathroom?'&quot;. (can you imagine how much your spouse would enjoy that after the third day?) other exercises tell you to &quot;interview at least a dozen people&quot; or &quot;sometime when you feel playful experiment with trying to motivate people to do impossible things&quot; like flying. what depressed person feels playful? many of these exercises would be highly embarrassing and certainly not within the realm of a depressed person's capabilities--especially those of us who are &quot;older&quot; and have physical disabilities. however i do plan to complete the written exercises. having outlined these minor drawbacks i have to say it's an excellent book--after all these years i finally have hope about rising from the ashes of depression.

" the novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the arthurian legends. they are in fact historical fiction at its best. whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy but to weave the stories into historic events. the first six novels in the series (that is all i have read though it appears that there are two or three more) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the arthurian legend. but the beauty of the books is in whyte's prose. a scottish poet he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and ours. these books will not insult your intelligence and they prove that one does not need to suspend the laws of physics or distort the facts of history to find magic in the arthurian legend.

" this is a cleverly constructed book of several parts and a few recurring motifs. jones a welsh methodist everton fc supporter london hack and oxford (arts?) graduate goes to live in parma italy where his beloved has established herself. he divides his book into nine separate chapters and tries to weave them together as well as his excellent english and his motifs will allow. the first chapter discusses nuances of the italian language and he uses those nuances to propound that italy is a much more nuanced country than england and that its culture is infinitely more refined. an entire chapter brings the nuances of italian culture to bear on football and he waxes very lyrical about the local youth and whatever immigrants are around playing ball as the sun goes down. the football allows us to place italian village life in our minds and to empathize very much with it. the last chapter is an entire ode to italy. it is written largely in the second person and it tells of you going through the village and everything there appealing to the aesthetic in you. the english is beautiful and it achieves its purpose in making you close the book with a warm glow. mission accomplished. the chapter on italy's catholic religion and its protestant and other minorities could have done with much improvement. italy's catholicism is more complicated than the padre pio cult and the protestants of the north surely have their faults as well. the chapter looks like it came from several previous publications he wrote. the politics chapters build on the hypothesis that the fascist and proto communist factions are still at war with each other and that politicians like berlusconi exploit this for their own nefarious ends. he does a good job of tying the warring world war two factions in with the protagonists and antagonists of later squabbles. he does not like berlusconi and his polished prose does not quite hide this fact. my opinion of this book is that jones sat down with his material and tied it all together into a very passable but rather superficial book which is nevertheless well worth the money being charged.

" great book; it get's you thinking. my kids arre almost out of the nest and they are all i could ask for. yes i worked. but not until they were in school almost always part time and i did not use 'working' as an excuse to not volunteer at school sports and generally be in my kids lives. the point is really about your priorities. do you instinctively put your kids needs first? it's been interesting to see how things have worked out with families in our area. we have a large group of kids who have been together since kindergarten; now they are seniors. you can instantly tell which parents were connected involved and had their priorities straight. not all of them stayed home the whole time. on and off i used to listen to dr. laura frequently agreeing but many times not. what i love is that she has an unpopular point of view and she's not going to let social financial or industry pressure dilute her message. yes she's frequently abrasive; so were many people who have made an impact in the course of events in this world. if you are a parent with young children read the book at least it will give you important ideas to agree or disagree with.

" this book provides a fine introduction to the myths of northern europe. the book examines the few remnants we have in the forms of epic poems and prose written by christian writers after the fact - the eddas beowulf and the viking sagas. from these sources especially the edda the author reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the norse gods and their subsequent twilight in ragnarok. then the author seeks to answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever relation it may have had to the original religion of the northern european peoples. the figures of odin thor loki balder and the rest of the norse gods play an important part in our european cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an introduction as here. whatever underlying mental constructs are behind such accounts as that of ragnarok (the twilight of the gods) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race as revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature. ultimately these beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the christian worldview. whatever your personal opinion about the replacement of the pagan beliefs by christianity and whether or not the pagan beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried you will certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to better understand northern europe in pre-christian times. finally it must be noted that in many ways at least in my opinion the society of the vikings was superior to our own. i admire the strong sense of individualism that the vikings expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic feats ",positive
" this was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the marian cult. the one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre-christian origins of the marian cult. other resources however cover the evolution of the anatolian fertility cult of cybele into the roman magna mater and later into the so-called &quot;bvm&quot;. the author does a good job of showing the origins of various aspects of mariology and contrasting these developments with christianity in the west. the author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the syncretic process which blended christianity with various pagan religions and medeival political structures to create the roman catholic church ",positive
" while previous guides for the serial drama lost have often left something to be desired the book finding lost: the unofficial guide more than makes up for it. nikki stafford's attention to detail (and believe me *all* lost fans should have a great attention to detail) is thus far unparalleled in any other guide book. you name it this guide book has it. in addition to the usual episode synopsis stafford provides readers with all the information they can handle including keeping track of the appearances of the numbers discussing theories pointing out bloopers and continuity errors illuminating connections and just generally proving that she has watched way more lost than any of us. in addition to all that stafford gives the low-down on each of the lost cast members before they became losties. even if you have watched each episode of lost 4 or 5 times and think you have caught every little nuance and clue hidden within it i guarentee you'll read this book and discover things you didn't catch or never thought of. one of my favorite features in this book is the essay that details and explains everything on the invisible map that locke briefly gets a glimpse of in season 2 during the episode lock down when the blast door comes down on top of his legs and a black light switches on illuminating the secret map. bottom line this book is a must have for serious lost fans. it would also be a great aid to anybody who is just now beginning to get into lost.

" with relations between the west and the islamic world worsening rapidly a better understanding of islam and its roots is badly needed in the west. one major barrier between understanding islamic culture is the key sacred text the q'uran has been little studied in the west and until recently good translations were unavailable. many qurans were translated into the same sort of english as the king james bible and not a glint of the quran's revevered poetic beauty was reflected in such translations. thankfully better translations in modern english are being made by leading islamic scholars who have a more sensitive ear to the poetry of the quran as well as a better understanding of the influence and appeal this text has for believing muslims. like all great works of literature especially a poetic one like the quran its power and beauty can only be appreciated in its original language. this is why muslims often say the quran is untranslateable but when one hears a verse of the quran being sung aloud with a little knowledge of arabic the beauty (while unfortunately not fully understandable) does start to become apparent. but even in translation when read carefully the quran still has great beauty from a literary viewpoint. the most beautiful part of the quran in my view is the 'light' surah which compares god to a light whose glory fills the entire cosmos. this surah has been a favourite with sufis islamic theologians like al-ghazzali and also muslim philosophers as well. while the quran does contain descriptions of violence and its style is often difficult to read for the westerner it is important to study this work with patience and try and see it as an organic whole rather than a fragmented jumble of poems. it is in this sense the deep underlying unity of the quran and its theology (which reflects the unity of allah the divinity in islam) becomes apparent especially in the names of god. a good knowledge of this religious classic is becoming indispensible in a world where islam is becoming more important to understand from a global perspective ",positive

" having read this book as well as barnet schacter's on new york during the revolution both works i find are flawed in different ways. the likeable thing about gallagher is that he manages to convey the story in less than half the time. the hard thing to realize about the battle of brooklyn is that it really wasn't much of a battle. the author here makes some grandoise statements about a new age of citizen warfare being ushered in with the advent of this battle. if that is so then the complete defeat of washy's army bodes ill for that development! gallagher is on better ground when he provides a nice overall of tactics and warfare in the 18th century. he gives a good account of training and recruitment in both armies. one of the more interesting things he mentions is that due to the two-rank line used by both sides in the revolutionary war casualties from musketry and artillery tended to be light. this is an interesting point and one not brought out by many historians of the period. in europe stronger lines of 3 and sometimes 4 ranks were employed which provided greater strength but also more density. hence increased loss from fire. a point well worth considering when looking at the battles of the revolution. most historians miss this completely or are not interested in it. gallagher provides more of a military history in general on this subject but he does waste a lot of time with preleminaries. more than half of the book is spent providing the standard background for the causes of the revolution etc. while certainly required for the general reader; when a book is as short as this one is it seems almost pointless. when we get down to the battle itself gallagher gives us not much more than schacter does. the british flank march completely compromises washy's position the outlying forces are swept away clear and simple. the confusion of command between putnam and sullivan no doubt made a bad situation worse. washy's complete lack of strategic perspective shows up totally here. the defense of brooklyn much less manhatten itself was a foregoon conclusion. washy was mad to consider defending brooklyn much less manhatten in the first place. he committed his ill-trained army to an impossible task. that he did not lose completely was due more to how the british under howe chose to wage their campaign. most american authors try to put a bright light on what is essnetially a dark canvas. at brooklyn the americans ran. period. a few units stood their ground in particular the marylanders but no one else really did. the reason why american losses were not greater was because they did run. some authors try to say that british losses in killed and wounded were greater than americans at this battle. this is true partly because the british had to attack some strong positions that held for a time until pireced by the assault. british losses were often greater in this regard because americans usually ran once the british bayonet began to strike home. still of the 1000+ casualities sustained by the americans here more than most us historians care to admit fell to british musketry and bayonets. the british loss was still well below 400. as the great maurice de saxe said in his memoirs of warfare in this period more of the enemy can usually be despatched when he runs as opposed to when he stands. to reserve fire until the enemy line breaks was considered the most effective tactic of this period. in that respect many dozens of rebels must have been shot down as they ran before british bayonets. gallagher provides some understanding why the british did not storm the heights right away. this has often been one of the major criticisms of howe's victory. why didn't he follow up? after marching all night to outflank the americans the british were disorganized and tired. they had also foght a running battle with a fleeing enemy. howe did not believe his army was in any condition to storm brooklyn heights memory of bunker hill or no. of course this does not explain why it was not done the following day. if we look more closely at howe's position we can perhaps explain his rationale. his commission was both a general and peacemaker. he wanted to convince the rebels to come back into the royal fold. he could best do this by showing how futile their resistence to the crown was. to have destroyed washy's army in brooklyn would have been gratuitous excessive. such loss of blood would have defeated the purpose in mind. in restrospect it is easy to find fault with this strategy and it would prove to be the only chance the british really had to crush the revolution in its infancy. the battle of brooklyn needs to be looked at from several perspectives. gallagher gives us a good start but i think a more comprehensive work still needs to address all the issues here.

" this is a nice compact hardback edition of dashiell hammett's five novels which he wrote between 1929 and 1934. a veteran of pinkerton detective agency in several cities hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks low-lives and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled hard-hitting detective stories. this was a time when urban corruption was the rule and private detectives journalists and police officers shared information. two of these novels &quot;the maltese falcon&quot; and &quot;the glass key&quot; are american classics. another &quot;the thin man&quot; inspired one of hollywood's best-loved movie franchises. hammett's novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place laying bare violence corruption and pervasive cynicism. but they're not dreary. the sharp prose crackles and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it steadfast in their own codes of conduct their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism. these five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels. &quot;the thin man&quot; appeared first in &quot;redbook&quot; the others in &quot;black mask&quot;. &quot;the maltese falcon&quot; (1930) and &quot;the glass key&quot; (1931) are flawless. &quot;the maltese falcon&quot; features private detective sam spade a irresistible femme fatale and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette. the last pages of the book are some of the most hard-hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction. and they're brilliant. &quot;the glass key&quot; explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed american city. oddly the detective is the right-hand man of a crime boss. &quot;red harvest&quot; (1929) features the adventures of hammett's most popular detective the continental op in a town called personville or poisonville to those who know it better. the always unnamed detective for the continental detective agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare. the novel's opening paragraph deserves to be read several times. &quot;the thin man&quot; (1934) is an attempt at humor among new york's blue-blooded cold-blooded upper crust. hard-boiled humor is interesting in concept. but i find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny and hammett's style was in decline at this point. at least his characteristic cynicism wasn't. &quot;the dain curse&quot; (1929) is another continental op novel. this one is melodramatic absurd and not up to hammett's usual standards. hammett fans shouldn't miss it but others may find it pointless. i described the novels in order of descending quality. &quot;complete novels&quot; organizes them chronologically. five novels is a lot to pack into one book. but &quot;complete novels&quot; doesn't resemble a door stop. it's a handy size actually. the print is not too small but the pages are quite thin. editor stanley marcus a literary critic and frequent admirer of hammett's work has included a chronology of hammett's life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book. the chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in hammett's life. the notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels which are useful. the notes also contain an introduction to &quot;the maltese falcon&quot; written by hammett in 1934 in which he explains the origins of that novel's characters. it's quite interesting. for those who prefer to own these novels separately vintage crime/black lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions. but if you want hardback and don't mind all five novels in one volume this is quite a nice book ",positive

" as a former history major and teacher i am very familiar with the history of the crusades from the western point of view. they have been portrayed in literature movies and history. they have been glamorized and vilified by westerners for centuries. reading amin maalouf's rendering of this familiar story from the view-point of arab chroniclers was like looking through alice's looking glass at a world that is backwards from the one we know. here we don't have just crusaders advernturers or even the evil conquerors that deconstructionists portray but invaders barbarians and enemies of god himself. this book is a must read for everyone who is concerned about events in the middle east today. it sheds light on a crucial time in history that affects the psyche of muslims who are living right now. especially helpful is the epilogue in which maalouf explains how the collective memory of the crusades colors the way many middle-easterners see the west. it is not riveting but very readable considering it is a translation. i enjoyed it and learned a lot ",positive

" although everything is shown in silhouette there is plenty of color and action and my kids (boy and girl; now 3 and 5) have always like it. there are herds of elephants steaming machines flowers critters and more. as the first spotlight reviewer did a good job of summarizing the assortment of critters and things that one can find i won't say more. but in regards to the use of silhouettes instead of pictures or detailed line drawings at least one reviewer has said that they didn't like them. but i think they miss the point. the book is about *shapes* and how much you *can* identify without the `advantage' of a detailed picture. and looking at the silhouette and identifying the item/creature is part and parcel of the mental exercise just like the rhythm and rhyme of the story. if you used pictures you'd hardly learn anything about `shapes' would you. no the use of shadows is just right for exercising young minds. for reaching for that aristotelian abstract (lol) of what is `skunk'. and it is amazing how even the littlest of people can tell a skunk from a cat even with seuss' odd artwork. five stars. 19 pages of fun for boys and girls. this sturdy boardbook is a good read-aloud that stretches the imagination ",positive

" i love this book--it's beautiful. this book is a delightful romp through the farmyard with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly causing the ruckus with all the animals. the abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and therefore may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend: the pigs in the muck the kittens in the hayloft the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish. but a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing fleming's gorgeous art each time. my nine-month-old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter--this is definitely one of his favorites. i highly recommend this book ",positive

" seventeen-year-old catherine morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things: dancing dressing and reading sensational novels. but doing these things won't get you a husband or acquaint you with other young ladies such as yourself. so upon request from a neighbor catherine is invited to spend some time in bath - a fashionable town where catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature who are not related to her. and that is where the naive catherine meets up with the thorpe family. quickly becoming friends with isabella thorpe catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious yet conniving family. and it is only when catherine is rescued by henry tilney along with his charming sister eleanor and whisked off to their ancestral home known only as northanger abbey. there catherine's choice of reading material - mysteries and ghost stories that is - comes back to haunt her; for northanger abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such as creaking and frightening winds that leave catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself. the fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors and a curious history only heightens young catherine's suspicions and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within northanger abbey and the tilney family in general. jane austen has been a favorite of mine since i was very young but it was not until this past weekend that i happened upon northanger abbey while browsing through the bookstore and decided to purchase it. i will admit that hands down this has become one of my favorite austen books. catherine is an enchanting character whose innocence and naivete make her charming from beginning to end; while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers. catherine's interactions with isabella thorpe and the rest of the thorpe family are intrepid and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters; while the charming henry tilney - like mr. darcy - makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman and our young heroine. a wonderful satirical piece of fiction that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an austen fan. erika sorocco book review columnist for the community bugle newspape ",positive

" i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book. this is not a book about cosmology (as people would expect from roger penrose). in this tiny book penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes (something much different from the opinion of 9999% of neurobiologists such as steven pinker). this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell-mann. the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories (thus the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works!). some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they didn't had in mind that this book is about penrose's point of view on intelligence. in fact i'm not a physicist nor a biologist simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand although i do not agree with penrose's point of view. i think he forgot something very important. read it and read the other point of view and you'll find what it is! : ",positive

" not many writers can characterize children realistically. somehow a stylized silhouette emerges and the child fades in the background and the plot or adult characters take over the storyline and the children characters end up being nothing more than fluff. this is definately not one of those novels. carson mccullers writes almost with artistic persicion on her two most elaborate characters f. jasmine and john henry west. i really cannot think of another story maybe a good man is hard to find by flannery o'conner where the writer can get inside the mind of a child; evoking their unique thoughts and feelings with a sense of ease. john henry west is one of the most well rounded and well written children i have ever read and that is a great homage to her writing ability. *i first read this at ten can see that age or older reading it. will have a intense impact on a sensitive pre teen reader ",positive

" this book has a lot of insights about various ways in which the ' pace of life and learning' have since the scientific revolution accelerated. in other words it is a book which gives one much to think about. the problem is that it also suggests that given the vast increase of information available to us the vast increase in 'possible alternatives' for our attention that we will probably have our minds moved away from the insights so rapidly as to not even absorb them. the obvious reply to such an intense barrage upon our consciousness is to withdraw. and when we withdraw and close out all that is accelerating around us we begin to try and make a pace and story of our own within ourselves. the faster we are forced to go the slower we may need to go. i think a companion volume or perhaps a contradictory volume should be written on all those human activities which might be aided by our ' going slower in them'. and along with this volume should be advice and recommendation of how to keep out of our life these seemingly endless intrusions which disrupt our living by our own rhythm. run slowly slowly horses of the night ",positive
" after talking to several pharmaceutical reps i know i decided to shoot for a sales rep job myself. this book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a job in the industry what kind of people you'll be dealing with what the hiring pricess is like (with particular emphasis on the interviews) and then what the job is like for people who manage to get hired. i'm very glad that i took the time to read this book because after finishing it i realize that being a pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible careers imaginable. obviously this is simply my own opinion and i know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind of work but nearly every single thing about it from the superficial way applicants are screened to the shameless pandering that sales reps must do on the job sounds simply awful to me. if you are considering a career as a drug rep you should definitely do your homework to make sure it's really something you would enjoy. this book may very well convince you that you would love it. if so that's great and i hope you are successful. but if this kind of work is not right for you this book can be equally helpful because you'll find out by reading it what the job is really like. there are a lot of books on this subject on the market right now and although this one was helpful i have to say that i think insider's guide to the world of pharmaceutical sales by jane williams is far more comprehensive and detailed than this one. if you only buy one book definitely buy that one instead. but if you buy two books pharmaceutical landing is a good second choice. one more thing: there's some sweet irony about this book that i just have to report. the author goes to great lengths describing how he scrutinizes every single thing about job applicants from their shoes to their body language. he also stresses well-written resumes and cover letters. one obvious piece of advice is that job applicants spell check everything before submitting it. imagine my surprise then when on the very next page it says candidates should ...right a short paragraph... about their job experiences. it seems to me that someone who is going to be as critical as this author is about job candidates ought to take the time to spell check his own book ",positive

" janet browne's far-reaching biography misses little in bringing us the life of the 19th century's most controversial biologist/geologist. the first volume of a two-volume set voyaging begins (as you would expect) with his youth in the english town of shrewsbury under his father's care. we meet his father - a doctor and businessman his brother - intelligent but unfocused and his late grandfather erasmus darwin who was well known at the time for his eccentric and agnostic views. from his early days browne depicts a darwin struggling to find himself first as a medical student in edinburgh then as a student of theology in cambridge. though we know better what darwin is to be browne's portrait of him manages to evoke the doubt that he must have felt when faced with adequate but uninspiring career options. but the story often returns to darwin's love of the outdoors and of biology - a theme which underpins all of his early feints and mis-steps at life. he is seen as a frequent hunter and an avid collector and cataloguer of insects and beetles. despite this and despite the benefit of hindsight at times i felt some tension - finding myself unconsciously wishing to offer advice to this young man who seems adrift and unaware of the great role that history was preparing him for. we finally catch a glimpse of that future as he fortuitously receives an offer to travel aboard the beagle a vessel bound for south america on a surveying mission. i won't spoil the rest other than to say that browne does an excellent job of building darwin showing in detail each moment of discovery upon which the next is laid capturing his excitement about the natural world as he slowly sheds his amateur standing and gains confidence - finally attaining acknowledged scientific stature. and yet even then darwin holds his boldest work out of sight of the world privately developing the theory of natural selection out of sight of a straightjacketed victorian society. in tenor it's clear that browne a professor in the history of biology greatly respects her subject. but she does not allow him to pass through her pen unscathed. darwin was a man of his times and of a certain station and held certain prejudices that the author doesn't hesitate to point out - such as his not wholly humanitarian attitudes about slavery. she also reveals what some may find darwin's less endearing traits such as his anti-social tendencies and his lack of any real passion for any subject but science (when approaching the subject of marriage darwin's priority on research causes him to discard several eligible but too learned women who he feared might place demands on his time). she does seem to soft-pedal darwin's poor treatment of his companions on the beagle many of whom contributed significantly to his efforts on that seminal voyage and whose contributions went largely uncredited and unrecognized. (for those curious this theme is well-explored in robert wright's the moral animal) also it was difficult for me to follow the various people who pass through his life and their relationship to him more my failing than the author's i think as she provides ample details on the many individuals who made an impact on darwin's life. if you do decide to read it it might be helpful to keep a pen and paper handy for jotting down a few notes (although the author does append a fairly extensive family tree at the front of the book). certainly the book is well worth reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in exactly how the theory of evolution (and the legend of charles darwin) was born. i've read few biographies better ",positive

" this book starts with the fundamentals of atomic structure and then builds on them until molecular orbital theory. molecular orbital theory is developed for both organic and inorganic substances. molecular orbital theory is used to explain the electronic structure of molecules which is of course of fundamental importance to the chemist. bonding theories for organic and inorganic models are developed and a brief treatment is given on the solid state at the end of the book. this is a book that i often use as a reference. this book is versatile enough to refresh the chemist about bonding ideas in both organic and inorganic areas. it is not a particularly advanced book but it was a pleasure for me to read and a good book to remind me of the basics when i need it ",positive

" having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the three musketeer series the following are my suggestions. 1. read all five books in order. the man in the iron mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context. think of the man in the iron mask as the dessert in a five course meal. dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable. getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that i was finishing a 3500 page experience. 2. read the oxford university editions. there are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events. when you read 3500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight. the introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter. 3. if you really like any one book in particular go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection. i purchased a used three musketeers with illustrations by maurice leloir. the three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable. along with sir walter scott alexandre dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel. i have been reading these types of novels my entire life. beyond a doubt alexandre dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre.

" the sun shines planets orbit corporations lie voraciously humans consume mindlessly and noam chomsky - the pre-eminent intellectual of the modern era - churns out knowledge elucidates the times and refutes the notion that it is our manifest destiny to perpetually suffer indignity. in a wide-ranging series of question and answer sessions chomsky tackles a myriad of seemingly disparate topics which ultimately pertain to and concern the economic and political system and the welfare of humanity. unlike books authored by chomsky himself which tackle specific topics understanding power - the indispensable chomsky is the transcript of sessions traversing a decade during which chomsky takes questions from the audience on a number of topics ranging from us foreign policy imperialism trade and the third world to propaganda corporate media solutions to the collective malaise and the march towards a more just system and society. expounding on his legendary encyclopaedic knowledge and command of logic professor chomsky manages to offer the questioners and by extension the readers a radical approach distinct from the boilerplate and mind-numbing discussions of the corporate media. refuting the suitability of handling our problems by working within the system and nibbling at the edges chomsky offers an alternative to the broken system without resorting to the expected customary answers like a broken record. as thoughtful and brilliant as the discourse is the book's editors also deserve much praise not only for the compilation but also for the easy to read format and the lively pace of the book. understanding power could easily have been entitled understanding the system and is a brilliant book based on the profound teachings of a brilliant thinker ",positive

" terry's son nile has honored his father (and done the rest of us a huge favor) by publishing this collection of the best of terry's shorter works. terry concluded at one point that film had surpassed literature as the communication medium of choice and devoted most of the rest of his life to that arena. his interview on screenwriting describes both the benefits and the frustrations associated with that choice. his advice is just as relevant to the would-be screenwriter today as it was when he wrote it. his proposed scene for kubrick's rhapsody and plums and prunes provide interesting examples of proposed movie scenes that will prove interesting to readers unfamiliar with that arcane art. as other reviewers have noted grooving in chi is an excellent description of the chicago riots during the democratic national convention in 1968. finally pieces like the beautiful-ugly art of lotte lenya when film gets good rolling over our nerve-endings [william burroughs] and writers at work [henry green] prove that he could write serious criticism. through it all flows that wonderful irreverent sense of humor. good stuff ",positive
" some long ago inventer discovered that if you place carefully shapped rocks just so they will remain in place as an arch dramatically reducing the amount of stone you need to hold up a bridge an aquaduct or the entrance to a castle. it probably wasn't too much later that someone recogniced that a bunch of arches next to each other would yield an arched ceiling to a room. my guess is that it then took a very long time for someone to recognize that if you made a series of arches in a circle you could make a domed room. but as soon as one was built i suspect that a priest of some kind looked up and immediately saw that a minature version of the sky had been created and that an artist could transform this sky into a 'vision of heaven.' this book shows what decoration has been applied to the insides of domed buildings from about the second century to the twentieth. it is an absolutely spectacular set of photographs of how artists have brought the heavens down to earth.

" alliterative analogies assertively assembled appear aplenty appropriately apt and artful absorbing attention ad infinitum. this could be a fitting summary of abish's stunningly &quot;now&quot; novel written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between kabbala and alliteration. chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter a chapter 2 with a and b and so on until chapter 27 when z first then chapter by chapter all other letters are progressively subtracted. in spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary they may have been culled from today's headlines: polysexually inclined thugs hide in africa after a crime spree with the author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them. chasing after the thugs from country to country we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite war and genocide corrupted burocrats and soldiers rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air where sparsely assembled people wollow in african indolence. all is narrated with poetic detachment in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality: it is just that the words were limited by my artifice reader the author seems to smile. no harm intended. perhaps: the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974 to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy. great art when unhindered relates to the whole of time in all tenses. while amusing abish has managed a ponderous read which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events. attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add-subtract letter scheme. and wonder: was it accidental? &quot;in order to be perfect all i lack is a defect&quot; goes an ancient italian folk ironic couplet ",positive
" although i'm not new to wwii histories the first world war is one of my favorite historical periods to read about and one of my favorite books from that war is alistar horne's the price of glory. since i enjoyed reading about one if wwi's most epic battles i did not hesitate to read stalingrad: the fateful siege by antony beevor. in both works comparisons are made between the battles of verdun and stalingrad and for good reasons. both battles were initiated by german forces that underestimated the tenacity of their enemy the course of battle spun wildly beyond their commander's control and both battles cost a near unimaginable loss of life and human suffering. beevor is especially keen on the amount of human agony throughout the battle of stalingrad which makes the book gutwrenching but at the same time the reader is unable to put it down. from the well-documented cold lice and hunger that haunted russian and german soldier alike to the disease and desperation experienced by the sixth army as they were slowly strangled in zhukov's trap it seems that beevor has overlooked nothing. unlike many battle histories that may focus on stategy or political fallout of the conflict the emphasis on human suffering and heroism in beevor's work makes the reader sympathize for russians germans romanians and anyone else unlucky enough to get caught in the battle. not only does beevor shed light on the plight of ordinary soldiers he also examines the more famous players in the battle; including a paranoid stalin a dreaming hitler a finger-pointing von manstein and a indecisive paulus. indeed the reader gains perspective from rastenburg and moscow all the way down the heirarchy to the frozen bunkers of stalingrad. overall stalingrad: the fateful siege is an excellent book that is recommended for anyone interested in world war ii or just any hard-hitting military history ",positive

" this book has a wealth of information for any practitioner of yoga from beginner to advanced. the content is concise and practical and the poses are sequenced in a way that allows for a gradual and safe progression in the practice. there are also dozens of practice sequences given for both improvement and how to treat common ailments through yoga. the introduction is especially valuable as it offers a no fluff in-depth commentary on the philosophical thought behind the asana practice. i pick it up again and again and am still referring to it after nearly 15 years of owing it. my copy is dog eared and loved and was well worth every penny. an earlier reviewer mentioned that the photos and layout were not user friendly and only gave the book two stars which is a shame. this book was first printed in the mid 1960's - over 40 years ago! it was the first yoga book of it's kind to ever be printed and it's content is timeless and as relevant today as ever. mr. iyengar even had to struggle with his then publisher to be allowed to include so many photos as it was so expensive in those days to print such a book. i say hats off to the man who brought yoga to the west long before it was ready. he's a pioneer and a virtuoso of his craft and his marvelous work should never be over overlooked just because it doesn't come in some glossy package fit for the masses ",positive

" this was actually the first kellerman novel i read and i found it kind of dull at first but that's only because i didn't know any of the situations or people among whom i was thrust. after reading a couple earlier books i have re-read this one and i now find it interesting. so i would really have to recommend that one tries to read the series more or less in order. this one starts out with alex delaware seeing a new girlfriend named allison. robin has married another man after some ten (?) years with alex. [i haven't read the one where she actually leaves yet (unless this is the first mention of it) but if she broke his heart ... !] see i had no idea who robin was first time i read this - makes a difference. the cuuuuute little dog named spike makes an appearance too. first time i read it he was just an irritating little squirt but now i know just how adorable he can really be and it was nice seeing him again. alex's police pal milo is a lieutenant now and can pick and choose his cases. he and alex are together when they come across a grisly crime scene. a young couple has been brutally murdered and the woman can not even be identified. milo draws alex into the investigation and it gets complicated. everything seems to lead back to the dead boy's psychologist and when she turns up murdered too things really start cooking with gas! i adore detective milo sturgis. i know alex is the star but i can't help it. milo is such a great character ",positive
" this commentary has many tremendous insights into the book of romans. romans is one of the richest resources of truth within the bible and john stoot does a good job of unpacking it. the book is written from a framework of the reader having a strong prior understanding of the scriptures. it is probably not considered a highly scholarly work but it is not for the average reader to pick up for light reading either ",positive

" billy collins's original voice is delightfully accessible often blending comedy and solemnity in one poem and always with something new to say. the playful tone of these poems can be misleading; whether he is writing about eating a good plate of osso bucco or his favorite museum rooms there is always a pathos lingering in the silence after the last line. most relieving is the absence of pretentiousness or haughty language. this is simply as robert bly writes in his introduction to the best american poems of 1999 collins's skillful ability to &quot;bring the soul up close to the thing&quot; in every poem. books such as &quot;the art of drowning&quot; threaten to change the face and purpose of poetry in the 21st century. let's hope there is plenty more to come from billy collins ",positive

" a wonderful wonderful book.although the book was written some 150 year ago mary eliza rogers takes you into the intimacies of daily life in palestine in the 1850's as if it was occurring today. she writes from her heart with honestyintegrity and a clear mind. and although written at a time of victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or judgement. from her beautiful and colourful descriptions one can envisage the holy land as it was before undergoing the process of modernisation and change. for anyone who has any attachment to this land it is a truly wonderful and personal experience to read this book ",positive
" the working notes of this book are utterly staggering in their implication to ontology. what is being? merleau answers in the manner of lao-tse and alludes to something like a divine-feminine at the heart of wild perception. it was said by sartre in his autobiography &quot;situations&quot; that after merleau's mother died who was like a &quot;goddess&quot; to him merleau returned began the project anew. what is intimated in the working notes is invaluable to the true student of philosophy and life. and in the end merleau returns to the very object of his study. you can really feel this descent at the book nears its end. it is however an ascent of the entirety of the history of philosophy to a new level of comprehension. that i assure you ",positive
" a quality photography book that visually recounts pertinent steps in the history of noir photography and more specifically the creation of the term noir as it pertains to film and photography in the 20th c. in new york city. a breath of realism history and fact that beautifully illustrates a fine curatorial example of the kinds of images published by the daily news that made this paper a forerunner in the telling of real stories suffered and celebrated by real people. william hannigan is to be commended for his fine selection of photographic and negative samples of a time not long past and still very alive in the movies and crime documents that inspire and fascinate us today. a necessary addition to any photo library of value ",positive
" i'm a big koontz fan and as is generally the case i greatly enjoyed this story. it was a little strange but that's to be expected from this author and genre. that said it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book. it had the curious sense of near-division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not in my opionion as well-connected as in many of koontz's other books. in addition the ending seemed a little hasty. thus i gave it four rather than five stars. that said i would gladly recommend it to a friend as i would most any of this author's work ",positive
" if you love ludlum's over-the-top novels (and i do) the matarese circle has to be up there with the best. not all of ludlum's books are a good match of plot and style -- the repeated &quot;oh my god!&quot; declamations of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on aren't as riveting as they could be (the two bourne sequels suffer from this problem i think.) but circle delivers on all fronts. part one is a masterpiece all by itself -- the intricate cat-and-mouse game between talienkov and scofield plays out thrillingly. and these are two of ludlum's most believably drawn characters; we feel empathy for both and root for them to join forces from the get-go. antonia gravet the inevitable gorgeous heroine/love interest who surfaces in part two brings a well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot. one final bonus: some of ludlum's zestiest minor characters appear in this book adding to the fun in nearly every chapter.

" this is the author's presentation of the satipatthana sutra the basic sutra on mindfullness. as in all of his works he does the work of a good dharma teacher very well. he keeps his own personality and teaching idiosyncrasies out of the way so that the student's understanding can arise naturally. there are more elaborate and academic descriptions of the sutra available and more detailed descriptions of how to use the sutra in meditation. but this is good basic information presented in a good manner with no frills or personal quirks. the author gives a good commentary on the sutra and explains why he translates certain passages but he also gives the alternate interpretations. this is a fine basic introduction to the central issue in vapassana meditation. highly recommended ",positive
" this is a great book to have in your collection if you're a fan of blues music and history. by far it's not the only book out there. there are a number of notable artists this book is missing. hopefully future editions of this book will begin to fill some of the gaps. that being said this is a very good reference just the same ",positive
" like many of the other reviewers here have already stated this is a book to be read by everyone! i am not a reader of westerns but i loved this book. after 800 pages i was never so sad to see a book end. lonesome dove has a little of everything drama action humor and a few love stories to boot. there are few books that have made me laugh or cry like this book did. by the time your are done you will have new friends woodrow pea eye claire lorena but especially gus mccrea. and you will also have some new villains particularly the frightening blue duck. i can't recommend a book any more than this one ",positive
" explodes upon the crime-detective scene. the hundreth man his first book was excellent and the death collectors is as good and even better. can't wait for the next one! why this is an amazon sale item befuddles me. but since it is grab this bargain while you can because it is a terrific novel! the psit team of lapd carson ryder and harry nautilus are faced with a dual-time mystery. more than 30 years in the past a serial killer with a following of mesmerized women who adore him is killed in the courtroom the day he is sentenced. and now; starting with the grizzly find of a murdered prostitute in a seedy motel room...it seems as though the serial killer has risen from the dead to continue his reign of terror. each time a new murder surfaces the killer is a step ahead and just out of reach of carson and harry. the touch of subtle humor adds bas-relief without taking anything away from the thread of the story and lightens it tension for brief seconds at a time.perfect! the murders are freakish! disgusting! brutal! but the two psit detectives refuse to give up and what finally unravels the twisted cloth of this old/new mystery will knock you out of your chair. a truly masterfully plotted novel with two familiar and charismatic 'partners against crime'. a series to follow and enjoy. get both of kerley's books and double your pleasure! try them you'll like them and you'll love jack kerley. i promise!!

" shadowbred by paul kemp is simply an excellent book. the story is incredibly engrossing the atmosphere set for each scene is really top-notch and the journey paul takes his character's through is really incredible. we see personal demons and struggles of the heroes. struggles with faith the journey of an anti-hero to a hero and whether he can really make this journey. the villains are equally deep and interesting and frankly human. if you are a fan of fantasy literature definitely pick this one up - you won't regret it. as a side note you might want to pick up the previous books by paul featuring erevis cale as well ",positive

" i think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you're facing in your own relationships are commonplace. they're not dysfunctional. every family has its share of issues and you don't need to feel overly guilty for yours. the book's underlying theme is that families that honesty consideration character belief and perhaps above everything else - resilience can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it's probably (though not always) worth the effort. stories include: resentment about controlling parents who appear to display conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up; the search for redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife the courage required to break relationships that are dead and the perseverance required to bring one back from the dead (and the effect on kids) dealing with the families of your in-laws and family objection to marriage how to deal with kids who are falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to you dealing with the death of a child how we feel obligated to spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to spend time with them and what we are losing etc. although it may seem that most people cannot relate to these situations... actually i felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and came away with a renewed conviction that i can get the perfect family life (with all it's frustrations and headaches) and balance it with everything. if you have any relationship friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration resignation about then i strongly recommend this book. it is one of those books that if it hits you at the right time - it could change your relationships and your life ",positive

" i'm not a huge fan of this genre of music but as a very part-time musician this book was recommended by a fellow friend and musician. i liked this book alot and found it education and entertaining even if the subject matter was not of immense interest. this is definitely not the fault of the author who did a fine job of making this subject engaging. thus i found the read illuminating to no small degree. i learned alot about the roots of punk how it spread and rose and the end of it. by correctly defining the terms of the book the indie years we only see what happens to the bands in their formative years. once they sign with a major label their story is ended. this was both a good idea and frustrating one as we see the birth and growth of bands but not what happens to them (in most cases) once they hit a major label. frequently signing with a major label creates/expands both the zeniths and nadirs for a band and i would have liked to have known what happened from there. regardless this book is well-written and a great read for any person who likes the bands included in the book.

" the miernik dossier was shockingly good. before this i had never read anything by mccarry. in fact i had never even heard the man's name. i was lucky to come across a review of this re-issued work in a magazine. now i am collecting everything by him. the story follows an odd assortment of people some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents as they travel south through europe into africa. for the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if miernik is who he says he is. the writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure. in that sense the miernik dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel but yet it goes way beyond that. it is also a highly compelling character study with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters. this makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are. the miernik dossier is a highly entertaining read. true spy literature in the vein of ashenden that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories mysteries or simply great writing. i cannot wait to read this book again ",positive

" as a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises. it's language is quaint and cozy to modern ears having first been written in 1856. but it is practical clear and encouraging. it dispells the idea that only certain people can draw. and by focussing on drawing with pencil it provides the foundation for using any other media. a wonderful find ",positive
" dr. amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family. the stigma associated with mental illness is deep-seated and difficult to overcome. understanding the root causes particularly the genetic predisposition within families is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life-long problems. these problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse: they do not deal with the biological root causes. once those are dealt with the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life. however without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch. take my advice. if the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar get help as recommended. you will become a new person the one you were created to be. and that is a wonderful thing ",positive
" we have used this book as a text for discrete math courses in our undergraduate computing engineering and systems program (university of los andes colombia). there are a lot of advantages using this approach instead of the classical one (e.g. people really learn to prove and learn to write correct proofs). however to grasp these ideas you have to be patient and open minded. when other reviewers give 1 star to the book it is clear for me that perhaps they were expecting something magical that did not occur. this presentation of logic and its applications to informatics provides an excellent way to learn and really use the knowledge in the praxis. in chapter 8 you go seamlessly from propositional to higher order logic. sums and logical quantifications are for example treated in an uniform way. maybe the type concept is not so fine explained but one has to remember that this is an introductory book. 5 stars of course ",positive

" as other reviewers have stated ludlum passed away at the time of the publication of this novel. unfortunately we may never know what other voice has been mingled with ludlum's to complete this tale. honestly speaking i believe this to be the case because the story is actually better than i have come to expect from ludlum. no disrespect intended but i feel this work is actually above his standard. there is certainly a few moments of unbelievable plotting and characterization but who cares when the ride is such a rip. at first you think you're reading a typical espionage thriller and eventually come to realize it's more than that much more. for new world order conspiracy fans you're in for a treat. ludlum et al's take on an old plot is so fresh and intrigueing you are left speechless. i'll just say this if you have ever wondered if the nazi's survived wwii you will really wonder after reading the sigma protocol. god help us if there's any truth to this plot ",positive

" i'm writing this before reading the whole book but its a collection of articles so the different chapters are discrete units under a common theme of the economies of the arab world with a good deal on the economies of their oil producing gcc members. reading this book more than twenty years after it was published is fascinating as so many of the issues and repercussions mentioned have either come true or held true and the state of the region has not improved considerably but even regressed in many cases. consider the following excerpt from the book that i found interesting: the oil states today face tremendous challenges as oil revenues start to decline. few expected that the decline would come so soon. everybody knew it would come but it was expected later rather than sooner. this is almost like seeing history repeat itself in real time. worth a look if you're interested in the field ",positive
" this fantastic re-imagining of the avengers is best consumed in this form. yes there are too many pop culture references yes the hulk is a little goofy and the ultimate nick fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe counterpart but i think once your done with this gigantic thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to complain about. this story arc takes the alternate universe avengers from their creation to their first major victory ill let someone else spoil it for you but its good. the second volume is juuuust about complete as of november 2006 and is pretty amazing as well. this is the best that the ultimate universe has to offer is one of the few titles exploring fairly original ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to teenagers no inline skates teen angst or first love in this one. millar and hitch are a great creative team but their ability to make deadlines is positively absurd. these thirteen issues took the better part of three years to be released and i read every one of those issues as it was released on the news stand. my wife got her msw in the time it took the skrull war to unfold it sucked and the new series isnt much better. thankfully it has only one issue to go hopefully well get it before theres a new president in the whitehouse. removed from the delays the series is a pretty impressive achievement the art is top notch and the story is positively crackin! yes it's just a super hero comic but its one of the best so if you like the medium and are lucky enough not to have read it yet do yourself a favor and check it out and keep an eye out for the second series hardcover ",positive

" according to charles kimball religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth. religion inspires humans to transcend their self-interests while at the same time more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution. using a comparative religious approach kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil. kimball argues the word `religion' is amorphous and difficult to define. as a result the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions. kimball next asks if religion is the cause of evil and he answers both yes and no. a religion that is arrogant condescending and requires adherents to disconnect their brain is problematic. on the other hand religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community. kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil. the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims. when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine the propensity towards evil increases dramatically. sacred texts sources of wisdom and guidance become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims. christianity and islam have missionary mandates but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims. kimball argues for a human view of truth one that is dynamic and relational allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions. another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience: when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities. when a charismatic leader demands total obedience has unrestricted power and has total control religion is unhealthy. uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection. strict segregation from the larger society combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous. kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence. every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future. when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time the likelihood for disaster increases. many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind. kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god's agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous. religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means: when one theological component gets elevated thus becoming an end and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end. all religions have notions of sacred space but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space. reinforcing or protecting group identity against an `other' or protecting group identity from within the group are also potentially dangerous signs. institutional structures develop in all religious traditions but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end. kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends. the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a holy war. kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of 1990-91. islam is a peaceful religion which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order. the word jihad means struggling in the way of god but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the christian just war theory. because of socio-economic disparities some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause. kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy. with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis. faith hope and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted. against secularism kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical standards and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity. with religious diversity christians have three options exclusivism inclusivism and pluralism but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity. finally the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community: if peaceable solutions are not found in the arab-israeli-palestinian conflict then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak ",positive

" arrogance by bernard goldberg is a truly enjoyable read. goldberg doesn't waste time trying to create a vast left wing conspiracy tied to islam or communism he just presents the facts as he sees them. as a former insider he's got the dirt on media bigwigs and he's not afraid to dish. the liberal bias in the news is causing many people to flee the big three networks and turn on cable to find an escape. goldberg offers up several examples of this bias and then goes further by coming up with several suggestions (some tongue in cheek) for correcting this slant. he also includes surprisingly frank interviews with tim russert and bob costas. goldberg's other books bias and 100 people who are screwing up america are also excellent reads. he doesn't attack people on a personal level (although you can tell he has a bit of a grudge against dan rather) or use hyperbole or vitriol to get his point across. some books written with a conservative slant make you want to throw up your hands and give up on this country but goldberg's books don't have that effect. you can tell he not only loves the country he lives in but also the profession that he's chosen and he has hope for the future.

" why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official? because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust confidence and cons. though the setting is a riverboat on the mississippi river just before the u.s. exploded into civil war its insights cross cultural boundaries. this is not an easy book to read for several reasons. first it is undoubtedly one of the first post-modern novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling. ( another example: dostoevsky's notes from the underground.) the confidence-man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat--beggars absurdly dressed frontiersmen sickly misers shysters patent medicine hucksters veterans (of the mexican-american war) and the hero in the latter part of the book the cosmopolitan. in typical melville fashion you also get asides--directly to the reader in several cases as if melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel. the lack of structure action and conclusion make this a post-modern type book but if you read each conversation as a separate story then it starts to make more sense. for what ties the book together is not a story but a theme: the nature of trust and confidence. in a very sly way melville shows how a variety of cons are worked as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do: buy the herbal patent medicine buy shares in a bogus stock venture or donate cash to a suspect charity. in other chapters it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself. since the book is mostly conversations we are left to our own conclusions; there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending. this elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust; we don't want to be taken but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted. to trust no one is to be entirely isolated. melville also raises the question: is it always a bad thing to be conned? the sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life. the ornery frontiersman who's been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth-talking employment agency owner. is that a terrible thing to trust despite a history of being burned? the ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored. we think the cosmopolitan is a con-man but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum he returns it just to prove a point. is that a continuance of the con or is he actually trustworthy? the book is also an exploration of a peculiarly american task: sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non-traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens. in a traditional society things operate in rote ways; young people follow in their parents' traditional roles money is made and lent according to unchanging standards and faith/tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well-worn pathways. but in america none of this structure is available. even in melville's day america was a polyglot culture on the move; you had to decide who to trust based on their dress manner and speech/pitch. the con of course works on precisely this necessity to rely on one's senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods. so the con man dresses well and has a good story and an answer for every doubt. the second reason why melville is hard to read is his long leisurely clause upon clause sentences. but the book is also peppered with his sly humor which sneaks up on you... well just like a good con.

" thirty five years ago my high school (thomas jefferson in federal way washington) held annual competitions in mathematics. they did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet just was a few pages long. there weren't many questions perhaps a dozen or two (usually in the form of story problems) but they required deep thought and concentration (at least for me). i still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as i took the white book and opened it to the first problem. several hours later i'd consider myself accomplished if i'd managed to completely answer more than half the questions. ian stewart's book reminds me of those tests. here's a sampling of what's inside: 1)mrs. anne-lida worm decides she wants a new couch and tells mr. worm to get it for her while she goes shopping for a new tight for baby wermintrude. but anne-lina doesn't want just any couch. she wants the biggest possible couch that can be carried down the hall in their house and around the 90-degree hall at the end. what shape does the couch have and how big is it? this is a truly riveting story. will mr. worm solve the couch problem in time? 2)alberto wants to conduct tests on grapes evaluating the influence of different soils. he wants to conduct experiments to see how different soils and exposure to the sun affects the quality of wine. his land is on a hillside though which is narrow so he can plant only three varieties of grape on each plot of land. how can he arrange things so that he tests all seven varieties of grapes when they are arranged so that each plot contains exactly three different species where any two plots have exactly one variety in common and any two varieties lie in exactly one common plot? sixteen chapters make up this book. though their titles are whimsical the mathematical problems aren't. some are still unsolved. even though these problems fit in what would probably be called recreational mathematics they are fiendishly cleaver with solutions and developed insight along the way that are at once challenging and rewarding. here's a sample of some of other topics discussed in stewart's book: how might one transport a lion llama and head of lettuce in a boat across a lake without leaving any two species where one might eat the other in the absence of a caretaker? how can you calculate the temperature and entropy of a curve? how can one even talk sensibly about a curve having temperature and entropy in the first place? suppose that you need to tile a room and the tiles come in odd shapes. is there anyway to know if the tiling problem has a solution? can mathematics tell us things about evolution such as whether or not evolution comes gradually or in spurts (or both)? this is a fun lighthearted book but the mathematical problems and puzzles it discusses will really make you think. i enjoy reading as i exercise on my elliptical machine. i get double the sense of accomplishment when i can read and workout at the same time. ordinarily i can estimate how long i've been on the machine by how many pages i've read - 20 pages in 40 minutes is about average. but with stewart's book i had to be careful. several times i found that i'd worked out for an hour and only managed to cover half-a-dozen pages or so. if you love mathematics particularly mathematical puzzles then this is a book you'll really enjoy. it has many problems for the reader with answers at the back of each chapter. if you do the problems and understand everything in the book in detail it will occupy many hours of your time. all in deep thought and utter enjoyment.

" of all of willard's books this one was my favorite. willard offers a systematic study of the nature of being and then proposes a pragmatic approach to setting the hear back on course to purity and submission to god. a human being he says (p. 30) is composed of thought feeling choice body social context and soul. he states plainly (p. 41) it is the central point of this book that spiritual transformation only happens as each essential dimension of the human being is transformed to christlikeness under the direction of a regenerate will interacting with the constant overtures of grace from god. such transformation is not the result of mere human effort and cannot be accomplished by putting pressure on the will (heart/spirit) alone. fundamental to this project is first dying to self taking up the cross and living in self-denial (chapter 4). we must then go through a process like learning a new language. the general steps he summarizes in the acronym vim: vision intention means (p. 85). these are a vision for kingdom life the will to do it and the means to carry it out. the rest of the book is structured around a look at the transformation of the mind (chapters 6-7) will (8) body (9) social context (10) and the soul (11). the work of the mind involves being cognizant of the ideas and feelings that drive our society and our personal lives. instead we should be renewed with love joy and peace in the inner life. the work of the will involves surrendering our will to god's and then moving from abandonment to contentment. here the spiritual disciplines bring to light our duplicity on these matters. the work of the body means realizing the over-emphasis we place on it and the need to cease idolizing and misusing our bodies. the work of our social context involves noting the use of assault and withdrawal that characterizes our relationships (p. 181). lastly the work of the soul which willard defines as the unifying factor of them all is best summarized in psalm 1. we are to be renewed into new beings who happily fulfill the law of god. again i said this was my favorite of willard's works. i'm not sure any of the rest of them so thoroughly transcend from the theological to the practical without missing a step. the systematic study of human nature is all-inclusive. he lays out a blueprint of a kingdom vision of what the human being (emphasis on being) is. the very nature of humanity from the state in which we find it to the place it is supposed to be is spelled out here. the enormity of the work is amazing for such a readable text ",positive

" i will start this review by noting two things. i greatly appreciated nussbaum's 'upheavals of thought' and i am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society i live in. (but then i recognise things in myself that - for good or bad - change my perspective from that of the society i am embedded in.) but wedekind's play 'springtime awakening' should raise alarm bells for most of us. we are sexual beings (most of us anyway) and we have to deal with that - learn to accept it within ourselves learn to share it with others (it is of course the quintessential sharing experience) learn to grow with it learn to let it go .... the easy path to take is to grasp a social 'norm' and follow it regardless of the morality of that path. societies do present many 'norms' to a young person developing sexual awareness but not all of these are equally desirable. if nussbaum's book does nothing else but diminish the acceptability of some of the undesirable 'norms' and enhance the more socially responsible ones it will have achieved a great service. there are curious things in this book for me. nussbaum refers to many sources but many of them are male - aristotle seneca js mill dh lawrence .... to be fair the last chapter is about 'to the lighthouse' by virginia woolf and other writers such as andrea dworkin are prominent. however i was surprised that some powerful women writers are totally ignored - where is mary wolstonecraft where is emma goldman where is mary shelley? why is 'maurice' (forster) referred to but not 'the well of loneliness' (hall)? the chapter on female genital mutilation (fgm) is an appalling indictment on the behaviour of some societies. nussbaum has a glancing reference to circumcision; not surpringly it is glancing for someone who was converted (so i read) to judaism. while i would never compare what happens to baby boys with what happens to young women in severity or risk nevertheless i think the motivations for both practices come from the same source. if for cultural (religious) reasons it is appropriate for jewish boys to be circumcised i think it is a very dangerous position to take to expect other societies to abandon the practices they see as legitimate if not mandatory. the chapter on equity and mercy impressed me immensely - it is so balanced i expect many feminists will hate it. but for me her rare use of a christian quote ('forgive them for they know not what they do.') was a revelation. never before had i seen how compromised that plea is. (compare with tolstoy: 'it is a wonderful thing to be loved because of oneself but it is a far more wonderful thing to be loved in spite of oneself.') the fact that often i have other feelings than nussbaum expresses does not concern me because she often has perspectives that broaden or hone my own thoughts. in the chapter on prostitution and its illegality i had to agree with most of what she writes simply from a libertarian point of view rather than one of morality. the morality issues are complex - perhaps irresolvably complex. just as there are men with 'dangerous' sexuality so there are women. perhaps it's only an issue for men because they demand or expect control. for me all of nussbaum's discussions seem to centre on the effects on women that prostitution entails - this is not inappopriate even though it may not be balanced. the problem i see with prostitution is that it panders to the man's 'need' to have sex. they can get it on demand. this reduces their sensitivities to the needs of the women in their lives including the need (wise or not) for a woman to have a faithful partner. in australia we had an advisor on women's affairs to the federal government write a piece in a newspaper where she expressed the view - based on her own practice - that a woman should always make sure her husband knew where the red light district was in a city they were visiting so he could satisfy his 'need' when she herself felt incapable. for me this is an appalling suggestion - as if men cannot have self-control and should not be expected to. but for all of that like nussbaum i would not see prostitution as worthy of being made illegal. for me this was a thought-provoking read. it had some incredibly ugly things to describe to consider. but it helped me to structure my thoughts in this difficult area - perhaps it will help me guide my boys as they reach maturity. other recommendations: 'springtime awakening' - wedekind 'the well of loneliness' - radclyffe hall (i hated the outcome of this) 'matilda' - mary shelley (her biographical details are worth exploring too) 'godwin on wollstonecraft' - william godwin (mary shelley's father; mary wollstonecraft was her mother) 'upheavals to thought' - nussbaum 'living my life' - emma goldman 'let me alone' - anna kavan 'conditions of love' - john armstrong ",positive

" this story drew me in at once because of the strong voice and the good writing. it clearly establishes a sense of time and place (modern day madison wisconsin) and offers the promise of an intimate look at daily life during the last stages of als (lou gehrig's disease) from the perspective of a personal caregiver. while we learn to understand the struggles of the patient kate this is more about the struggles of a college student known as bec as she travels an emotional path of coming into her own. author michelle wildgen fulfills the promise. this story is character-driven and what made me turn the pages wasn't the story which was at times a bit slow and uninspiring. with the exception of the blue butterfly the additional sex scenes felt extraneous. further one can guess from the beginning that in terms of kate's condition there wouldn't be a `happy' ending. regardless wildgen paints a very realistic picture of als and definitely puts you in the room. what made me turn the pages was wildgen's ability to make each of her characters come alive. i cared about them and wanted to see how they'd handle kate's progressive and ultimate demise. bec is the narrator who learns as she goes (both how to take care of kate and how to cook for her guests/staff/family). we see everything through her eyes particularly as she becomes kate's voice. the title you're not you comes from kate as she asks bec to speak for her in a manner beyond mere translation. the secondary characters are also well developed including kate's husband evan bec's roommate jill and to a lesser degree bec's lover liam. liam a married faculty member represents another dimension of bec's floundering and her search to in a sense pick a major. ultimately the story becomes a vehicle for bec's eventual direction of career choice. i recommend as a thought provoking read and for the strong writing and character development. additionally if you know (or have known) someone with als i believe you'll appreciate the author's knowledge and sensitivity. from the author of a line between friends mckenna publishing group ",positive

" i recently re-read antony and cleopatra prior to attending the colorado shakespeare festival's performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in boulder. drawn from sir thomas north's 1579 english version of plutarch's lives william shakespeare (1552-1616) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career around 1607 and published it in the first folio in 1623. it tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers roman military leader marc antony and the captivating queen of egypt (and former mistress of julius caesar) cleopatra. when his wife fulvia unexpectedly dies antony is summoned from egypt to rome to mend a political rift with octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister octavia. of course this news enrages passionate cleopatra. she vents her anger on the messenger but is quick to realize that octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty. however antony soon follows his heart back to cleopatra's arms abandoning his new wife in athens. this leads to war when octavius declares war on egypt. after octavius eventually defeats antony at alexandria cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide which prompts antony to wound himself mortally. antony dies in his lover's arms and rather than submit to roman rule under the new caesar (octavius) the heart-broken cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs. in the end antony and cleopatra is as much about new sparks re-igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes. it is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re-read and understand shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next. g. merritt ",positive

" carson mccullers one of america's greatest southern writers was often misunderstood as many people were put off by or unwilling to deal with her (at the time) controversial subject matter. mccullers used the grotesque as exaggerated symbols of everyday experience. the loneliness and isolation of her gothic-like characters were merely extreme examples of feelings we all have though magnified and intensified to the nth degree. tennessee williams in his introduction to mccullers' reflections in a golden eye posed the question (in a mock dialogue) most people asked about writers of the 'gothic' school such as carson mccullers flannery o'connor katherine anne porter and eudora welty: why do they write about such dreadful things? williams replies in my opinion it is most simply definable as a sense an intuition of an underlying dreadfulness in modern society.. why have they got to use..symbols of the grotesque and the violent? because a book is short and a man's life is long... the awfulness has to be compressed. mccullers unlike any writer i have ever read pierces the heart of themes such as love isolation and loneliness with her lucid poetic prose. tennessee williams in virginia spencer carr's biography of mccullers summed up mccullers' writing as follows: i have used the word 'heart' but it is not an adequate word to describe the core of carson mccullers' genius....i believe in fact i know that there are many many with heart who lack the need or gift to express it. and therefore carson mccullers is what i would call a necessary writer: she owned the heart and the deep understanding of it but in addition she had that 'tongue of angels' that gave her power to sing of it to make of it an anthem.

" for the english-language reader wedgwood's book which has been in print for over sixty years is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of european history. it gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations: the principal antagonists at the outset -- ferdinand ii of austria and frederick v elector palatine; the condottieri-style generals - spinola von mansfeld tilly wallenstein piccolomini christian of halberstadt bernhard of saxe-weimar the duc d'enghien (conde); the contentious minor rulers -- maximilian v of bavaria johann georg of saxony; the northern monarchs -- christian iv of denmark and gustavus adophus of sweden (and his daughter christina and prime minister oxenstierna); the spoiler cardinal richelieu; the new emperor ferdinand iii and his cousin the warlord cardinal-infant ferdinand of spain; and many others. this book is written in a traditional english historian's prose style that is clear eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories while still covering these aspects of the period. in spite of some reviewers' claims of a protestant bias in her interpretation the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of the participants (dynasties rulers generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of germany and bohemia. although i am not familiar with this new edition (and grafton's introduction) i emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the holy roman empire during the sixteenth century with a special emphasis on the composition of the bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the habsburg king-emperors. the extent and internal organization of the bohemian crown lands should also be outlined. a succinct review of the political status of lutheranism calvinism the bohemian brethren and other protestant confessions throughout all of europe around the year 1600 and a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in setting the stage for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious-denomination consequences of the war. the author supplies sufficient details on the major battles but this is not a work of military history. as wedgwood knows battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their political consequences. and it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war (including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes) that wedgwood excels. in her analysis of the general european situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of forces which underlay and drove contemporary events. each was a source of conflict and each might cross-cut the others complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved. in brief the forces were: (a) religion with three major competing factions (catholic lutheran calvinist; she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the roman catholic church). (b) nationalism (french german czech etc.) which was a new force on the scene crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality (which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests. (c) monarchic-constitutional issues which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the constitutional grouping of major and minor powers known as the holy roman empire (hre). the constitutional problem was twofold. within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout europe (duchies counties free-city areas ruled by town councils and mayors) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers' powers and privileges were taking place. aristocrats oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies (estates) reluctant to cede their own powers (taxation the organization of military service) to a central authority. the same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the hly roman epire that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected emperor (who had been a habsburg for several centuries) and the smaller rulerships of central europe. the religious reforms rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio eius religio (whoever rules his religion [is the religion of the ruled area]). in the year of the war's inception 1618 this new balance was very fragile comprising four catholic and three protestant imperial electors. in germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the emperor (resident in vienna or prague) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals especially the protestant electors had been somewhat codified by the augsburg treaty of 1555 and were known as the german liberties. these would prove to be especially important to the three protestant electors at the outset of the war. in the developing continental war one could be pro- or anti-habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them. for example a catholic ruler (including the papacy) might seek protestant allies in order to combat habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the empire which affected his position adversely. or a protestant power might accept the habsburg program in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage (this characterization is apt for saxony and brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war.) as wedgwood notes all three considerations (religion nationality constitutional relations) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions. from the point of view of rationality or predictability political choices and commitments were often self-contradictory (e.g. a catholic power supporting a protestant venture; a german liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power etc.) or temporary expedients that made the overall european situation more chaotic. the war began locally in bohemia but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as spain and england (even farther to the caribbean naval theater) as far north as sweden and northeast to poland as far south as italy and southeast as transylvania; in other words it was a european continental war with global impact. when the war broke out in 1618 it was over the habsburg violation of a constitutional guarantee of religious freedom in bohemia (the concessions stated in rudolf ii's letter of majesty). and here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role. ferdinand ii who had knowingly violated the terms of the letter soon after being selected by the bohemian diet as king (and therefore the first in precedence of the hre electors) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the habsburg dynasty in bohemia and elsewhere he was firmly committed to the goals of the catholic counter-reformation (i.e. re-catholicizing all of the areas within the hre which had become protestant during the last one hundred years). when he was deposed by a special convention of the bohemian estates (the defenestration of his deputies in prague being the signal event of this deposition) the crown of bohemia was offered to the elector of the (rhineland) palatinate frederick v who considered himself a champion of the protestant cause. the religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war. given the other major conflict hovering in the background -- the spanish habsburg determination to recover the now protestant area of the netherlands which had become the successful and defiant (dutch) united provinces - the war soon became international. while the entry of france and then denmark followed by sweden into the war during the 1620's changed its nature and extended its duration wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two protestant electors johann georg of saxony and georg wilhelm of brandenburg and one catholic ruler maximilian of bavaria. it is her contention throughout the book that johann georg and maximilian in particular could have prevented the war's spread and forced ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand. despite their religious differences these two were always strong german liberties proponents and each had the same view of the austrian habsburg rulers: they should be kept for the broader protections they offered but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers. in the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals (saxony switched sides and joined the swedes for several years while maximilian's position was constantly and secretly supported by his nominal enemies the french as their potential foot in the habsburg camp.) wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of germany. wedgwood's gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great-power politics and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists. her summary of the changes emphasizes the following: (a) religion had discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war. religion was becoming more interiorized and private and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science (this was the era of galileo and kepler with descartes harvey hook newton huygens etc. on the near horizon; a time of laboratory science and scientific societies.) as the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about. (b) for thinking men nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action. this was very obvious in france but even true of ferdinand iii for whom the new main cause was the construction of an austrian-based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the holy roman imperial protector of far-flung german catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile. in the minds of both germans and austrian habsburgs the holy roman empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in germany. the elbe-north german-pomeranian ideal empire of wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program. austria began to move south and east (toward italy croatia and hungary) in its expansionist aims. (c) the control of immense polyglot multi-religious mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them - they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent mobile states unto themselves cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes; whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad they changed sides. the most successful mercenary generals had become mini-sovereigns. officers were all out for themselves and for their troops (rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster) since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement -- the most famous commanders ernst von mansfeld wallenstein bernhard of saxe-weimar the swedish general wrangel all expected (and some received) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service. the national armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem. the pace of the war wound down during its last five years (although there were several major battles fought even then) which was a period of extended negotiatons in mnster and osnabrck with the final treaty being signed late in 1648. for the next five years a series of conferences met at nrnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies. many of the loans of this period which were raised to cover the demobilization costs were not paid off for a century. individual rulers such as charles of lorraine and the duke of savoy (who got nothing from the treaty) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years but the war did not break out again. france and spain continued at war with each other but not in germany. numerous soldiers especially officers went into mercenary service all over europe. others took to the hills as professional bandits - for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of germany and bohemia in armed caravans. wedgwood accepts the more recent (1900-1930's) historical estimate that the population of the imperial german lands (excluding alsace and the netherlands) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648. the number of dislocated people was also substantial. while she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other infrastructural and economic losses were very large she feels that all contemporary sources (e.g. the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years) exaggerated local losses since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution. the free peasantry benefited briefly since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates - prices fell while wages rose for a number of years which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans. but within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with imperial royal and local rulers to impose legal restrictions which would re-create bonded serf-like conditions for peasants. town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants (e.g. prohibitions against mobility domestic industry and household craft production -- a trend which later historians refer to as neo-serfdom). class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started. there was a new large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court-backed military and bureaucratic appointments at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers. germany and the austrian-based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing atlantic trade. for a number of years the outlets of germany's major rivers (rhine elbe oder and for brandenburg-prussia vistula) were controlled by foreign powers reducing germany's commercial strength. hamburg was the exception becoming the major maritime merchant city of the north sea coast at the expense of the other hanseatic cities and the scandinavian powers. the only medium-sized german state to emerge with positive prospects was brandenburg soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful prussia. the peace while ending the wars of religion set the stage for a long series of nationalistic wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict. france replaced the habsburg spanish-austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace. austria turned to the south and east and spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater. there was no politically or culturally unified germany within the boundaries of the old empire (french culture began to reign supreme) and the cosmopolitanism (its openness to outside influences) of this area during the 18th century instead of being a source of pride over its achievements became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of revived german nationalism. author's judgment and conclusions: in terms of responsibility for the overall disaster wedgwood points to the futility and self-destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of ferdinand ii and the elector palatine. but from the point of view of failures of practical (and ethical) politics she highlights the behavior of maximilian and johann georg who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a unified german program which would have forced imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it. between these two she sees the saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances (pressed by the swedish juggernaut) and therefore less culpable for the mess while she judges the bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow germans thus identifying him as the more culpable. beautiful in its style and concision wedgwood's final summary is also gloomy (as one might expect of a work completed in 1939 on the verge of world war ii): as there was no compulsion towards a conflict which in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame so no right was vindicated by its ragged end. the war solved no problem. its effects both immediate and indirect were either negative or disastrous. morally subversive economically destructive socially degrading confused in its causes devious in its course futile in its result it is the outstanding example in european history of meaningless conflict.

" the book is not 'really' on christ in the etheric but more several - unrelated - lectures about etheric life. sometimes christ only gets mentioned at the very end of a lecture. the book can be summed up as an accumalation of lectures of cosmic life if you like: the spiritual life that is connected with and influences life as seen only from/with physical senses. in the book is recorded about several ages (golden age silver age iron age and dark age) and that how in each age clairvoyant abilities - [or really spiritual consciousness] - diminished with each age and that the dark age has ended in 1899ac and that in this current age people need to become spiritually aware again to the point where they have a damascus experience (experience of saul - later paul - in which he saw christ in etheric form). people who do not become spiritually aware will be bound into the earth consciousness/sphere and could cause disturbances in the earth. in this light rudolf steiner communicated about the brotherhoods - in western and eastern countries - and how they try to prevent people from developing spiritually to the point where they will be able to meet christ in the etheric (= 2nd coming of christ (coming in the etheric)... and in future times coming of christ (i.e. manifestation/presence of christ in the astral)). in the book is also recorded about the sermon on the mount - with the beautitudes (recorded in matthew 5) where jesus communicated about the development of the soul (as recorded in other books by rudolf steiner (sentient soul intellectual soul etc.)). in the book is also recorded about the afterlife if you like: life of souls who have passed away and are still earthbound and how those souls are connected to those souls that are incarnated in a physical body in earth. in the book is communicated about different levels in the 'afterlife' and how feelings and will are active. it is recorded about astral plane lower devachan and higher devachan in etherization of the blood and later on again in three realms between death and rebirth where is recorded in greater detail how activity in those realms is connected with life of souls incarnated in the earth and how christ is also present there and can be experienced in earthly life as 'destiny'... and how people are so focused on what is or has happened but don't pay attention to what is result of it not happening (e.g. getting delayed for an appointment or coming ('unexpectedly') too early etc.). destiny is at work with christ having its workings present in it according to rudolf steiner. in the book is also located about the double and how forces from within the earth influence it [geo-biology]. ireland was a place where those influences where most 'healthy' for spiritual development/cognition and ireland was the place where christianity was able to flourish and waver out from to europe by irish monks ",positive

" first the story takes place in the 1940s (harold's brother is mia in wwii not in vietnam as the amazon.com review erroneously states). second the writing is superb. mr. lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel. his characters are very real. his setting (a small struggling circus traveling the western u.s.) is historically believable peopled with 'freaks' who suffer as sideshows unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with but peopled also with 'normals' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks. harold the 14-year-old albino central character tries to straddle both groups of people. he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer. i am admittedly ignorant about such things but mr. lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants--crucial to the plot of the novel--seem believable. my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end. i do want you to read this book so i will try not to give anything away here but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character's last words and even gomer pyle-like (people actuallly say gosh!). this did detract from the impact of the death unfortunately but i still very strongly recommend this book. five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot!

" unlike most dystopian novels which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future a clockwork orange focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. our protagonist is alex only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal roving the streets with his band of friends taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. the boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. in fact the more helpless the victim it seems the more pleasure the boys take in the act. the most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. they aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. they are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them. everything changes however when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. there though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality. then after two years he is chosen for a new experimental rehabilitation program designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in or even contemplate any acts of violence. as we see however this treatment also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not. he has to be good because he is programmed to be. this of course raises the question central to the book: does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice? the book can be a little difficult to get in to at first predominantly because of burgess's unique style. the story is narrated by alex and thus is written in the complex slang language invented by burgess for this book that the youth of this society engage in. for example a sentence taken from the opening chapter: he looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that (pg. 5). there is no glossary but if you stick with it you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters. however if you find yourself having difficulty a nice comprehensive lexicon can be found on wikipedia if you search for english to nadsat (due to review guidelines i am not allowed to include a direct link). unfortunately it is alphabetized by the english equivalents not by the slang terms so looking up a word can be a little difficult. one final note of interest: the original british publication of a clockwork orange had 21 chapters as does the current american edition. however when the book was first published in the united states the last chapter was dropped. as burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout. whether it is or isn't is up to you to decide but i can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book. without the final part of the story in place the book offers a bleak message implying that human nature cannot really change. on the other hand reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope. beyond that burgess tells us in his introduction interpretation is up to you ",positive
" renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer robert m. place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book the buddha tarot companion: a mandala of cards. this book affords a rich unique perspective of the tarot through the lens of the buddhist paradigm. the companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions embellish this box with protective and/or empowering symbols. other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the buddha cards include: smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading. and store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy promote healing or provide protective energy. also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards. both items are published by llewellyn who as always have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented. robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the buddha with the tarot journey through the cards. he describes how the major arcana fits perfectly with the life of siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment. each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic's journey to enlightenment. in fact it is mr. place's belief that the creators of the tarot were directly influenced by the life of the buddha and incorporated archetypes into the major arcana based on his journey. he teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another. instead the classical world maintained communications with india and the ancient western philosophers were familar with indian philosophies. as well the islamic world introduced the christians to the life of the buddha during the middle ages. the european christians were enamored with the story and they transformed him into a christian saint - st. josaphat. i was fascinated by the titles given to the major arcana cards. each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the siddhartha's personal journey to become the enlightened one the buddha. robert place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice eastern beliefs. he also acts as a mediator to help people of the western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of buddhism and its teachings for life. i highly recommend this deck - i found it very easy to follow the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to read using a buddhist world view.

" though i usually go in for tough police thrillers i sometimes mix things up by reading a light funny mystery or- like this book- a quiet thoughtful mystery set in a small town (a cozy i believe this type of mystery novel is called). still life nicely combines the easygoing attributes of a cozy mystery- quirky eccentric characters a small-town setting pretty much no violence- with a little modernity in the form of occasional well-placed profanity (though not much) and modern demographics (a gay couple is included among the main characters). the main detective character intelligent and interesting owes a little to christie's hercule poirot but not everything. the mystery itself is pretty interesting too though some aspects of its solution are a little broad and clunky as are some of the explanations of why ultimately cleared characters were acting suspicious for a time. any shortcomings are quibbles however and shouldn't deter one from trying out this nicely done mystery story set in a quiet little corner of quebec ",positive
" one reviewer claims that this is marred by some of eliot's unfurtunate preducices. but how come you don't say something like that about o' henry. we can't just stop reading authers because you we don't like their views. someone calls hemingway looking forward? if that's looking forward i'de rather look backward. hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever. most of the people that reviewer named justly loved eliot. eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past but towards what we have made out of the present. in name of progress we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls. to call eliot conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous the first draft according to one of eliot's biographers was absolutly a expression of relavtism. one critic accused him being a nihilist. on the poem itself eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone not to mention his brilliant use of imperfect rymthe. so it doesn't have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets. so he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism we could use more of that. yet what he doesn't right he evoces through mode and tone giving us truly one of the best poems of this or any other century.

" generally my eyes glaze over as i reach chapter 3 of most business books as they provide the mastery of the intuitively obvious. make your own luck by shapiro and stevenson has broken the pattern. written in punchy conversational style the book is a delightful combination of anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds in personal and business decision-making. the process of setting goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and failure. this sounds as if it could be tedious but it's not. the authors know you are not sitting in a policy course. they know that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of the time without focusing on the decision as a bet. the book makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to move through those bets with speed and focus. in managing investments i'm betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors and company specific performance as well as betting on the actions of other investors. the tools in make your own luck such as the prediction map are completely applicable to the inferential analysis i use in managing investments as well as life's major problems such as how to seat guests at the next dinner party. this book is a good read. shapiro and stevenson incorporate topics from baseball to the metropolitan museum of art. make your own luck makes you laugh makes your think and gives you tools to improve your own lot.

" ironweed by william j. kennedy was the latest selection for a book club i've recently joined. the premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie (at the group meeting) that was based on the novel. as i expected the movie paled in comparison to the book despite the screenplay being written by kennedy himself. jack nicholson plays the main character (francis) and meryl streep is his wanna be socialite girlfriend (helen) but this star power doesn't elevate the story beyond what kennedy had already done in the novel. set during the great depression ironweed is a great look at the underbelly of society: drunks homeless impoverished and in that regard the story is timeless. i enjoyed the characters' quirkiness and the loosely connected plots but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption forgiveness and love. the love aspect may be hard to spot but it is there unconventionally in many of the character's interactions. this favorable recommendation comes with a warning: it can be a depressing read definitely not a happy one and while i found it inspirational it will not conjure any blithe emotions. ironweed is definitely not a june beach read being more apropos to a long winter night indoor by a warm fire.

" this is a wonderful overview of a critical sector of the western front. across the region known as flanders three particularly brutal battles were fought during the first world war with a horrendous loss of life suffered for minimal territorial gains. this book provides enough information about these battles to be informative yet unlike many military histories it avoids becoming boring because it is not overly detailed. it also discusses the battles from all perspectives including the high ranking politicians the often inept generals but especially from the viewpoint of the poor infantrymen who suffered incredible hardships including shelling bombing machine gun fire gas attacks and wretched weather conditions. in addition the author has a wonderful approach to writing making the book a very absorbing read that is difficult to put down. it is a shame so many historians including such military writers as david glantz do not emulate groom's style ",positive

" i have written a lengthier review of this work elsewhere. but i did want to say to potential readers that the peggy antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to the global women's movement that as such it fills a long-felt-want and that it is to be recommended to those new to unfamiliar with or who feel they should be allied with the women's movement. it would - it will - make an excellent text for those doing women's studies as to those doing social movement studies whether globally or more locally. summarising antrobus shows the women's movement as political as recognising women's relationship to social conditions as processal as posed against patriarchal privilege as beginning where and when women recognise their separateness and even their alienation marginalisation isolation or abandonment within wider movements for social justice or transformation. one complaint but which is much more widely spread than in this book alone. this is the avoidance of the word `capitalism' - even by feminists who are or were once socialists. capitalism does not even get an index reference in antrobus. capitalists mostly after all male white and patriarchal call it capitalism and are proud of it. so why cannot it not be so named by feminists who could and surely should condemn it? this cannot be solely because of their justified criticism of the archaic political-economic determinism of patriarchal socialists. so it has to be due to either a desire to be salonfhig (acceptable in the salons within which they have been speaking to the funders they are dependent upon) or a restriction of their utopia to a kinder gentler global capitalism a global neo-keynesian order - for which no convincing feminist case has been made. pity ",positive

" luc ferry raises some very important and pressing questions about the implied praxis behind deep ecology. does the vision of society espoused by deep ecology depend on an authoritarian social structure? does deep ecology demand a level of political correctness which places its premises beyond question? ferry is not the first to raise these questions. the institute for social ecology led by murray bookchin has made the critique of deep ecology its bread and butter. of course there are plenty of ideologues within radical ecology but they do not make up the whole story. particularly glaring is ferry's one-sided depiction of eco-feminism. in fact some eco-feminist work in the u.s. has been particularly sharp at questioning the orthodoxies of both radical ecology and feminism. the questions which occupy ferry should be asked by every person who is involved in radical ecology and many of his criticisms are on-target for a specific body of work. but he doesn't bother to see the whole picture and readers should be careful to read beyond the quotes cited by ferry and to study deep ecology and ecofeminism on their own terms ",positive

" leonaur ltd. is publishing the definitive edgar rice burroughs 21st century editions. these usually contain 2 books of the different erb major series in order - thus far john carter pellucidar and carson of venus. in the future possibly tarzan! these books are handsome and my rating is mainly based on this - the erb fan knows best about the rest of it. this first volume of joh carter of mars contains 2/3 of the greatest science fiction/fantasy trilogy ever. what is nore remarkable is that these were published over 40 years before tolkien's lotr and over 50 before tolkien became fashionable. a princess of mars the gods of mars and the warlord of mars are erb's greatest work. it is sad in a way that tarzan obscures erbs mars novels for the general public. these books deserve to be beter known and it is astonishing no movie or tv adaptation has ever been attempted (which might be a good thing after all!). if only steven spielberg or peter jackson were interested! of course genre and erb aficionados have long know and cherised these great stories. i wonder how many others were first attracted to these by the magnificent ballantine editions of the 1960s? if you are a fan as am i support leonaur ltd.'s efforts by buying these magnificent books.

" as i began to read this book i was reminded of jack dempsey's observation that champions get up when they can't. all of us have encountered professional setbacks of one kind or another and some of them are especially difficult to overcome. most of the examples which jeffrey sonnenfeld and andrew ward cite in this book involve ceos who either fired backand eventually prevailed after a career setback (e.g. donald trump martha stewart bernie marcus jimmy carter and george foreman) or never fully recovered from them (e.g. jill barad john scully leona helmsley jacques nasser and linda warnaco). the former demonstrate the importance of seven lessons to turn tragedy into triumph which sonnenfeld and ward recommend; the latter demonstrate the probable consequences of failing to understand and then apply those lessons on which a five-step strategy - for rescuing and restoring a career and reputation after a devastating professional setback -- is based. it would be a disservice to sonnenfeld and ward as well as to those who read this brief commentary if i were to list the lessons and steps which are best revealed within the narrative of this remarkably thoughtful eloquent and practical book. each is anchored in a real-world context. each is relevant to anyone now embarked upon or preparing for a professional career. i mention this last point because some who consider purchasing this book may incorrectly assume that its material will be of greatest value only to senior-level executives. on the contrary all of sonnenfeld and ward's observations and recommendations can be of substantial benefit to anyone who wishes to (a) avoid a devastating professional setback or (b) recover from one. in essence this book provides sonnenfeld and ward's response to this question: how can i overcome a professional setback? to their credit at no time do they minimize or trivialize the impact of a professional setback. (presumably each has experienced a few of his own.) they fully appreciate the difficulty of overcoming the debilitating psychological stress of failure the challenges of failure to one's reputation (both personal and professional) social biases about failure and other challenges which may be unique to one's company its culture and its industry. if not tragic or devastating a setback almost always lowers one's self-esteem is embarrassing and has adverse financial consequences. more often than not there is collateral damage to one's family members and/or to one's close colleagues at work so guilt also comes into play. recall the dempsey quotation provided earlier. presumably sonnenfeld and ward agree with dempsey on the importance of courage and also with me that it is much easier to summon the courage to get up when you are convinced that the situation is not hopeless and that you can indeed recover if you understand what has happened why it has happened and how you can - and should -- respond to it. of course it is preferable to avoid a setback in the first place. (if `ifs' and `buts' were fruits and nuts....) most of us are not so fortunate and i for one have learned the most important lessons from failures (mine and others') rather than from successes. whether or not a given failure is our fault it is certainly our responsibility to take full advantage of the learning opportunity it offers and then to make positive and productive use of whatever truth has been revealed. it is interesting to examine the lives of great leaders [who] rebound after career disasters but in my opinion it is imperative to examine with rigor and candor one's own values attitudes and behavior - especially when struggling to understand and then recover from a professional setback which is invariably a personal setback also. as sonnenfeld and ward make crystal clear this journey of personal discovery is by no means easy. nonetheless it is one which must be initiated with commitment and then sustained by persistence throughout one's life. if and when setbacks occur - and they always do - the practical advice which sonnenfeld and ward offer in this book will enable those who absorb and digest it to understand and (yes) accept what has happened understand why it has happened and then leverage that wisdom effectively and productively not only in their careers but in their personal lives ",positive

" this is the second book in the wind dancer series. the wind dancer being the first which was excellent. i almost feel as if i liked storm winds even more than the wind dancer and i believe it's due to a more comprehensive abundance of history. i was absolutely and totally absorbed with this book from the first chapter until the last one. the characters were very individualistic and intriguing. i have to say i enjoyed the romance more between the two supporting characters: catherine and francois more than the main characters: juliette and jean marc. i was enamored by francois and his strength steeliness and sensuality. jean marc was a dark handsome man as well. because of the way juliette was treated in her youth i see why she was so desperate for someone to need her; hence her demanding take-charge attitude to care for her friend and others. catherine was a delight. she was soft caring and sweet but her terrible experience made her strong and even more beautiful in nature. fascinating characters and historical background. i would recommend this book to all those who love romance that isn't the typicaldull harlequin type and a love for important historical eras.

" i have been planting flowers from seed in my home for almost 5 years now. last year i had over 1400 seedlings on multi-level shelves under flourescent and natural light in my dining room. (boy do i need a greenhouse!) so this book was not a lot of new information to me. a lot of what is listed can be found on the back of a seed packet but it's not practical to sit on the floor of my favorite garden supply store and read every seed package for suggestions before i buy it. (this is important because i'm not interested in refrigerating my seeds 3 weeks before i plant them or doing other such preparations required for some seeds.) one major thing missing from this book was photography. there were drawings but i'm sorry to say that they were mostly a way of breaking up the monotony of the text rather than a reference tool. on the good side this book did an excellent job of providing the proper germination environment and each plant had a quick reference in a shaded box that listed the type of plant (annual perennial etc) its hardiness zone and its flowering season. this allowed me to quickly eliminate the plants that were inappropriate for my zone. the regular index wasn't very useful but one wonderful addition was an index of the common &amp; latin names. i refer to this when looking at some of my books that include the full color photography i was missing. (almost makes up for it....almost!) of course there is the standard hardiness zone map but they also added a map each for the probable first and last frost dates.

" as a social worker in private psychotherapy practice i find that sometimes the work can be isolating and at times i question whether i should make more of an effort to consider the latest trends in psychotherapy. mary pipher affirms that the classic skills that make a good therapist such as compassion empathy listening skills reframing and the ability to induce a sense of calm are timeless. furthermore even if i wasn't a therapist i think i would still devour this book because her writing is a pleasure to read. i highly recommend it for anyone just starting their career in therapy or those who have been in the field for decades. this book is bound to become a classic ",positive
" i have many robot books and this is the best and most informative book of all. it is easy to understand and read; i personally couldn't put it down. i wish it was twice as long while still marinating the high info density... most authors just babble and every few pages actually tell you something; this is not the case with this book! the programming of a robot is everything... and behavior based programming is the only way to go. this book provides a very good intro into that very subject. the only complaint i have is not about the book but his robot simulation program on is website which is referred to in the text. it seems to be rather slow and over taxing for the pc but being a java app it's not that surprising. highly recommended to anyone building robots ",positive

" alien invasion stories have been done to death since h.g. wells gave us the war of the worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre. well william c. dietz pulls it off with death day and the concluding volume earth rise. what sets death day apart from most of the invasion tradition is first of all the invading force being made up of different races. this makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles in-fighting and fight for freedom (some are slaves to others) make for something new different and engaging. also using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true and tragic note. the surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves close off their borders and horde resources. the aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on earth. and sadly collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans. but the seeds of rebellion have been planted. humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races. all this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach. i enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. dietz is the best sf writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting.

" harvey e. goldberg is one of the pioneering sociologists in the study of the jewish communities of north africa especially the libyan-jewish community. in this present work he brings to bear the experience and knowledge of a lifetime of study and practice as a jew to provide an overall historical anthropological view of the jewish life- cycle. he opens with a chapter on 'being jewish' then considers birth circumcision naming . he goes on to discuss 'rituals of education' and then has a central chapter on 'marriage'.an especially innovative section is on 'pilgrimage and creating identities'in this one he opens one of the central themes of the book the way the increased importance of the individual in jewish life and thought has led to more varied religious practice. his chapter on 'death mourning and remembering' also includes a consideration of communal remembrance. this is not as might be expected his closing chapter as he adopts the traditional teaching which he is reminded of by one of his many interviewees and ends with something 'good' his final chapter is on 'bonds of community and individual lives'. this book is extremely well written and a delight to read. i especially enjoyed the instances where he brings in personal anecdote to illustrate and deepen a set of observations. goldberg has a true command of traditional jewish religious sources and these texts form one real basis of his life. but what is especially exciting is his reading the communal variations across time in response the religious and communal demands. as one long familiar with much jewish tradition and ritual i was surprised again and again by new observations and insights. anyone who loves jewish learning will love this work tremendously. i cannot recommend it more highly ",positive

" james moseley was the stereotypical rich orphan trust-fund kid inheriting millions while still in college. he promptly left college and attached himself to a shady indiana-jones-style south american graverobber. the graverobber wanted for some reason to do a book on the flying saucer myth then only a few years old. moseley was sent crisscrossing the us to interview anyone and everyone who had made contributions to that myth in the period 1947 - 1954. the book never materialized but moseley was left with extensive notes and the indelible and accurate impression that apart from a few people who had genuinely seen something in the sky they didn't recognize and would have been expected to if it were anything familiar the majority of the mythmakers were as my old grandma used to say crazy as a betsy-bug. over the years moseley kept his hand in meeting and interviewing anyone who came onto the scene in what he sometimes calls the field other times (more accurately) ufoology. he edited and published a long series of saucer fanzines and newsletters and still publishes one to this day. he met everyone and he shrewdly sized up everyone. he organized many flying saucer conventions and seems to have attended most of the others. here's his information-packed account of about 48 years in the field and there is no more accurate word-picture anywhere in print in english (i've looked!) of the classic early 1950s contactees led by george adamski on to the 1960s abductees led by betty hill on to the growth of the crashed-saucer myth from its humble beginnings with the 1949 scully hoax on to the full-blown roswell hoax of 1985 - 90 and on to the supernatural abduction stories of the 1990s. moseley was an eyewitness to the birth of many hoaxes a few of which he perpetrated himself. highly recommended as a true insider's look at this nearly 60 year-old and seemingly immortal myth of things seen in the sky.

" mark liberman and geoffrey k. pullum could be accused of making the best of an already satisfactory situation in publishing this book that reiterates their ongoing blog on linguistics. but for this reader having never visited their blog (until now) this book is a treasure trove of quips and oops and pooh bahs and evidences of the strangely twisted manner in which we communicate. written in a casual style that makes the faux pas revelations more cogent the authors share embarrassingly poor writing from the media from authors from those in control of the country (as though the mentality of the us might somehow be reflected in the malapropisms of george w. ...yikes!) and yet reading this blogline of information never seems vitriolic. criticism is one of the most substantial ways to create change and hopefully this book and blogline will focus many minds on the misuse of the english language perhaps effecting some much needed corrections. far from the madding gerund (didn't you always wonder why thomas hardy used that word in the title of his great novel 'far from the madding crowd'?) is a book to pleasure the mind - and humor - and a fine resource for perusing before writing or speaking to a group of wise souls. so maybe it is a print form of a blogline but for those of us who tire of wading through the computer for reading it is a complete (?compleat?) pleasure! grady harp june 0 ",positive

" it is interesting to see how golems evolve from pratchett's discworld novel feet of clay (1996) where they are speechless slaves of clay to going postal (2004) where a well-educated but humorless golem serves as body guard and lecturer-in-morals to the new post master. this is where it all begins... commander sir samuel vimes of ankh-morpork's night watch pays a visit to the dragon king of arms at the urging of his new wife who thinks sam needs his own coat-of-arms now that he's been knighted. unfortunately one of sam's ancestors was a regicide so his descendent is denied an armorial bearing by the college of heralds. he does learn that one of his watchmen is actually the earl of ankh: the inimitable corporal nobbs who is forced to carry around a piece of paper signed by ankh-morpork's patrician certifying that he's really human. well this is a bit of a come-down for sir sam but he's got more important matters on his mind including the murders of two harmless old men. one of them was beaten to death by a loaf of dwarf bread. his body was discovered by captain carrot and corporal angua the only werewolf in the night watch when they visited the dwarf bread museum on their day off. the only link between the two corpses is a trace of white clay at both murder scenes. subplots zigzag every which-way through feet of clay. corporal 'earl of ankh' nobbs is being courted by a group of well nobs who haven't given up on the notion that ankh-morpork should be ruled by a king. captain carrot hereditary king of ankh-morpork who wisely refused the crown in men at arms is busy tracking murderers and emancipating golems. sargeant colon is about to retire if he lives through a trip through the sewers with wee mad arthur. corporal angua helps a new dwarf recruit come to terms with her yen to wear lipstick. death who has at least a walk-on role in all the discworld fantasies is still working on his sense of humor: i am death not taxes. i turn up only once. if this sounds confusing it isn't. it's brilliant. all of the story lines tie together according to character. i don't know how pratchett digs through the sewers and stockyards of ankh-morpork and rubs together a monarchist plot with a bit of animated clay to create such a gem. i think he must use magic.

" bailie draws on rene girard's theory of foundational violence as the generative cultural force and explores its modern effects on a culture no longer enthralled by ritual or sacralized violence. i found especially compelling the newspaper accounts of violent acts which have taken place within my own memory. bailie uses these along with historical accounts of scapegoating to illustrate his theory producing a hard-hitting indictment of all forms of violence whether isolated actions or legalized responses to a violent act. increasingly i find it difficult to distinguish between an act of violence and an act of retributive justice. i have not read a newspaper account of a violent encounter the same way since reading violence unveiled nor do i react to photojournalism with my previous detachment. the impact stays with me despite the fact that i read the work initially two years ago when i borrowed it from a friend. i now have my own copy heavily underlined and notated in the margins with thoughts spawned by bailie's excellent analyses. provocative and insightful ",positive

" this is the second novel in the mystery series featuring marcus didius falco an informer and sleuth. a series of books that have become hugely popular so much so that the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers. it was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements that would be and should be found in rome in ad70 but to have a lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day new york cop. in this novel the hero marcus didius falco has returned from the remote island of britannia a god forsaken place whose people are morose and surly and the weather well the weather is best left to its own devices. marcus has lost his heart to senator's daughter helena but is not sure that the passion he feels is reciprocated. why is that women he is not interested in fall over themselves to get to him but the one that he has lost his heart to treats him with a cool disdain? he has not long returned to the welcoming arms of rome before a series of fatal accidents and things that go bump in the night convince falco and the emperor that there are traitors still conspiring and they must be brought to book. falco is not happy it seems he must leave his beloved rome yet again but the conspirators are serious about their plans and will not let anyone stand in their way. will falco ever return . .

" i did a course on quantum theory in the 1970s with john ward who was recommended for the nobel prize in 1965 (feynman schwinger and tomogana shared it). those close to the action will know of ward's identity. john (died in 2002 from memory) used feynman's lectures as his course notes. i must confess a soft spot for feynman. i would have loved to have been in his lectures (buy his audio tapes and you will get the feel for his delivery). he was truly a great physics communicator and often understated his mathematical abilities (after all he had won the putnam prize at some stage so he was no mathematical slouch). his development of qed is simple to understand and that says it all about his genius. he took the view that if he couldn't give a simple explanation then he really didn't understand the topic. the current crop of tool polishers should heed this. anyone who is really serious about physics (and maths) should read the original papers and this is a classic example. i suggest that you fill in the gaps in the derivations. if you can't do that then you haven't really understood it. it is fascinating to compare feynman's approach with schwinger's more abstract approach. i prefer feynman's but schwinger does a hugely impressive job in stripping qed down to its logical (almost truth functional) essentials. buy this book and see how a first class mind works. peter haggstrom bondi beach australia ",positive
" (3.75) the other reviews can reveal what this book is about. what i wanted to share is the extreme responses this book incited in my boyfriend and me. he alternately found himself loving the narrator yuriko's sister for her brutal honesty and hating her for her malice and psychological bullying of kazue. meanwhile i found myself rooting the narrator on as she spoke the cruel truth about the pitiful hopelessness of kazue's meritocratic dreams but a moment later i wondered if that made me a bully myself or as bitter and heartless as the narrator. perhaps it reminded me too much of what i had seen growing up to shock me. then there was the simultaneous hilarity and pain of kazue's cluelessness. was she a tragic figure blind or both? i admired kirino for inspiring me to feel so much for her characters even for yuriko who is certainly not the ditsy airhead her older sister wants us to believe she is (i also found it hard to believ she was as ghastly as she considered herself in her 30s: is it just because women past 25 in japan are regarded as christmas cake as a friend from japan says?). my attention was quite strained by zhang's tale of chinese hardship (it seemed the wrong book to educate the reader about how difficult it is for immigrants in japan) but i immediately forgave kirino when yuriko's older sister admitted herself zhang's account was tedious and could be skipped (i'd recommend others to skim it as well). again my patience was tested by kazue's journal: i just kept on thinking aren't you ready to die yet? but i see this was intentional on kirino's part to make the reader struggle between our (or my) wanting kazue to just give up on life and our feeling ashamed for our coldness and complicity in her bullying. it also made my boyfriend and me think concurrently of the people we loved in our own lives who were heading towards the same fate as kazue and yuriko not through prostitution but through drugs. what did disappoint me in the end was the last chapter which seemed a cop-out. if only an editor had suggested it was unconvincing and encouraged her that an alternative though more shocking would be more in line with the narrator's character but that is wishful thinking on my part. when i give this book to others which i will i will make sure to discuss with them when they've finished what they thought of the ending. this book could have been edited down a hundred pages (back when it was written in japanese) but for what it did offer i have no regrets for its consuming my attention entirely and will always look forward to further translations of kirino's books. this book may not be the masterpiece out was but for anyone who has gone to an elite school on scholarship striven to remain a petite zero wanted to excel while recognizing how off-the-mark our values of judgment are or wondered just how much her body could be worth reading grotesque is just as powerful an experience as reading out was ",positive

" i think this is the best book that i have ever read. i thought that the civil war was very very boring but when our class started to read bull run i knew that i was wrong. the way that paul fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to read more. from the way paul fleischman described the characters to the words that paul flesichman use to set the tone of the characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going on in your minds eye. each character has a different story of the war and of life. i would suggest this book to anyone who is learning about the civil war. it supplies you with a lot of information you might not get in the history book and tells it in a way that makes you want to learn. this book was excellent from the first page i read. even though this novel is very brilliant some people might not like it. if they can not wait to know what happens to a favorite character like one of my favorite characters dietrick herz. he had the funniest voice i ever heard. when paul fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you hanging. but the only way to find out the ending is to read the entire book and find out what happens for yourself. and trust me it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book. the best that i have ever read and if i liked it then for surely you will love it too trust me. before i read bull run i had only read books with one or two characters and this type of book was really really new to me. i had to get use to it a little but since it wasn't very hard to read it only took a short time to adjust to the bull run story by paul fleischman. some of the characters that i really liked was toby boyce because he had a good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife. another was carlotta king because she had a very spunky voice in this story like how the yankees would get rid the of the law so that the slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and what i mean by that is they can practice there own religion. another one of my favorite characters is vergil peavy. i think that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in the story. in the story he sounds like he's from texas also the way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes. and my last favorite character is shem suggs because he was the lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what they are like who they should be with. shem suggs is the person who takes care of all the horses that he watches pretty much like baby sitting the horses. but the reason i really really like him is because he minds his own business and doesn't talk to people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his friends which are the horces. that is the reason why i like shem suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because he is smart ",positive

" what do you do when the world is coming to an end right before your very eyes but no one seems to believe you? that is the concept facing dr. thomas more distant relation to the famous/infamous saint thomas more in walker percy's novel love in the ruins. the united states is at a time of crisis but few seem to understand the implications of the events unfolding around them. it is up to dr. more who knows how to diagnose the problem but not necessarily treat it to try to prevent the chaos from happening. the story begins on a hot fourth of july with doc staking out the abandoned howard johnsons motel in town. in three separate rooms he has cocooned his three paramours and he is waiting for an event that he knows is going to happen; an event that could very possibly bring about the end of the world. the novel then shifts back in time to the three previous days tracing doc's journey that led him to seek refuge at the motel. the reader learns that he has created a ontological lapsometer a sort of stethoscope of the human spirit through which he can diagnose exactly what ails a person's soul and finally discovers how to treat it. meanwhile there is a revolution brewing; the bantus and love children are ready to take over what the white man has destroyed if a major catastrophe doesn't befall everyone before that can happen. love in the ruins is a truly southern novel crafted through percy's intelligence and tempered with the same absurdity that is a trademark of great southern writers such as percy and flannery o'connor. the reader must suspend disbelief as to the events unfolding even though they are frighteningly realistic and not so far-fetched in this present day. percy's hero doc more is an antihero on par with those of hemingway; flawed prone to drink forever chasing after women who are wrong for him. this novel is his coming-of-age in a sense because doc learns what it is he wants out of life and how to best achieve that. subtitled the adventures of a bad catholic at a time near the end of the world love in the ruins is a deliciously funny and poignant look at a near-apocalyptic america ",positive

" i should first confess my bias--i have often been tickled and sometimes awed by mortimer's way with english prose for 20 years. so in picking up this book i had the high expectations one might have before meeting an old friend or beloved teacher. no disappointment. even if some of these essays are slightly less effervescent than others all are at least wonderful and several are both brilliant and touching. mortimer has given us a collection of short essays conversational and often wryly funny which he intends as a kind of spiritual bequeathal to his family and other heirs. the chapters range across a broad range of subjects some perhaps outwardly frivolous like the cooking of eggs. but in the main mortimer touches on matters of great substance--the nature of beauty how to be happy surprising ways in which our world has managed to be unjust places and times for sex how to dine sociably the love of children faith and reason the terrors of the writer facing blank paper and many more. i found these essays to be wise and absolutely delicious. i suspect that readers who have enjoyed rumpole or mortimer's other biographical essays like summer of a doormouse or clinging to the wreckage will be quite pleased with these sketches. mortimer may sadly be nearing the end of his life but at present he seems to be on a literary tear. i for one wish him many more prolific years ",positive

" doctor livingstone i presume? is undoubtedly one of the most well known quotes in history. very few people however are familiar with the history underlying the meeting of dr. david livingstone and henry morton stanley. this book details the lives of the two men and the historical background through which they were thrown together. livingstone one of the foremost explorers of his day is searching for the source of the nile river. through a combination of bad luck poor planning disease weather natives etc. livingstone is virtually stranded on the banks of lake tangyanika. henry stanley a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at the direction of his publicity hungry publisher. this book details that mission and the international setting under which it took place. the perils of african exploration in the late 19th century cannot be overstated. this book does an excellent job impressing this upon the reader. i found this book very similar in style and experience to undaunted courage (which detailed the voyage of discovery undertaken by lewis and clark) and river of doubt (dealing with theodore roosevelt's exploration of the amazon basin. if you enjoyed either of these books you will like this one as well. if you read this book and enjoy it i highly recommend the other two ",positive

" charles h. kahn's account of the pythagorean philosophical tradtion although less than 200 pages long is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. in a concise but intelligent summary kahn traces pythagoreanism from its semi-legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as copernicus and kepler. as a young academic who specialises in the pythagorean tradition i can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars but as a latinist i must say i was disapointed by kahn's treatment (or lack of) of this strand of western philosophy in late roman and medieval thought. but this is still the best up to date history of pythagoreanism available in the english language ",positive

" for over three years i've been studying buddhism and zen. during that time i've ordered many books within the different buddhist schools. there are many fine authors out there that explain the tenets and fine workings of buddhism as well as zen. i believe a solid background in buddhism background is essential in understanding buddha's message to mankind. however the true nuts and bolts of buddhism practice can be found most directly in zen. it is one thing to know something about a religion or way of life yet it is another to be able to apply it. ezra bayda has most succinctly given the best instruction of how to apply zen to one's life where we need it the most; during those moments when we are gripped with our core pain. core pain is comprised of our anger traumas sadness feelings of inferiority etc. it is this core pain that can make our life a living hell. ezra examines these emotions and teaches us how we can mindfully learn to transform them in a way that truly works. instead of denying them or trying to escape them we learn that they are part of our path in life. and while it takes courage to be present with these emotions we learn that they are but old programs and often ancient belief systems that take us away from the genuine life we all deserve. at least one reader has referred to this as being like a self-help book. yet anytime we look for truth whether it be in religion or psychology aren't we looking for something to help us. ezra offers us the tools to achieve transformation in our life. when i ordered this book i had hoped it would teach me how to truly apply zen teachings to my life. what i didn't realize is that the information this book contains would exceed anything i have read in any religious book psychology book or college text. another reviewer said where's the zen in reference to the contents of this book. the zen is there on every page. while ezra doesn't use the esoteric style of writing common in zen/buddhist teaching his simple clearcut way of communication exemplifies the simpleness that zen is truly about. ezra's other two books at home in the muddy water and saying yes to life are excellent as well and deepen your understanding of living mindfully and in the moment. a helpful hint read his three books in chronological order with this book first. personally i think that reading them in order adds to a person's understanding and that each book acts like a foundation for the next. ezra bayda i have not had the honor of meeting you personally yet i thank you most sincerely for the gift of your writings. i bow to you for you are a master! there are many of us i'm sure that are looking forward to your future works. two other excellent zen books that teach mindful living and dealing with difficult emotions are beginning mindfulness: learning the way of awareness by andrew weiss and at hell's gate : a soldier's journey by claude anshin thomas. also the writing's of thich nhat hanh a great man who highly influenced both of these authors teaches the art of mindful living in a very understandable manner. good luck to you on the path.

" this was an astounding book about an even more astounding woman rachel shilsky a.k.a ruth mcbride jordan. written by one of her 12 children james this book is both biography (mother) and autobiography (child). a polish jew (white) who fled her oppressive surroundings in backwater virginia ruth met and married two different black men and managed to raise 12 children in some extremely difficult circumstances in harlem new york. not only did she start a baptist church with her husband she coped with a regular dose of racism some significant poverty and still managed to send 12 children to school (all of whom became professionals and productive citizens). the book is written by the son but the voice of the mother is registered throughout (in italic print). she evades all queries about her background her family in fact any of her history and it is not until much later that the son uncovers her history (abusive father crippled mother) and the reader is even more impressed with the fortitude and will that it must have taken this woman to make her own life in a community that was not of her economic racial or religious experience. although the book is ostensibly about this man's childhood and his remarkable mother it is also a fascinating glimpse of racism religion and social exclusion in the black communities in new york in the 1960s. each of ruth's children experienced a certain unease about their racially `different' mother and yet each became aware of who they were and what they were about. this book is just a marvelous read. full of funny and sad tales of a rather unique family life mcbride's work is a tribute to his extraordinary mother.

" the opening of the mauritius command brings us some changes especially for captain jack aubrey who finds himself in the improbable role (for him) of husband and father of twins. unsuccessful and hapless in his domestic life he immediately jumps at the chance to leave england and take over a new command. off the coast of africa jack is promoted to commodore putting him in command not just of his own ship but of a small fleet. in the course of the book jack stretches his abilities to the fullest as the british vie with the french for possession of several small islands crucial to controlling the india trade. of course dr. stephen maturin is on hand too. his facets as doctor naturalist and spy all come into play in the course of the novel. the previous novel h.m.s. surprise involved incredible physical suffering loss and rejection for stephen so it was nice to see him get a break in this installment. however stephen is still haunted by what has happened to him. a dark current runs through him that no doubt will resurface in future books. the overriding issue explored in this novel is leadership and what it means to be a good leader. jack has to deal with two very different captains serving under him one of whom is a silly and vain man who is kind and familiar with his men and thus beloved by them. the other is a brave commander who exercises brutal tyranny with those under his rule. the weaknesses of both men lead to very different disasters. in spite of the battles and some serious turns of event the mauritius command involves more action and comedy and less angst than h.m.s. surprise making it a lighter read.

" this book provides a good and clear overview of the subject of mysql. this is a thick book that covers a lot of material. the last chapters even provided introductions to application development with c perl and php. mysql: the complete reference really seemed like an actual complete reference. while it may not go to deep into every subject it does at least briefly cover each topic. most of the focus was on sql (structured query language) though. there were only a few minor issues with this book aside from minor grammatical errors. for one thing you would occasionally have to modify the sample tables before you could even start the exercise. also it would have been nice having more sample tables and data so i could follow along in more of the examples. frequently my result set wouldn't quite match the one in the book. additionally some of the command wouldn't even execute or would return an error message. lastly the chapters on development were pretty useless unless you are already familiar with one of the languages. but i believe many of the above problems where because of version differences and the fact that i was running mysql on windows. although windows instructions were given as well the book examples were still more oriented towards a unix installation. also mysql would be several versions newer on my computer. i believe that made a difference on some of the results as well. and for windows administration its better just to use one of the suggested gui programs since many of the commands were difficult to run from the command prompt. so i wasn't quite able to follow along with all the examples for one reason or another. nevertheless there were still plenty of quality examples i could follow along in. in addition there was still a lot to learn from just reading through the material. overall this book works well as a reference or for working the chapters in order. even though the book's user level isn't indicated i believe it provides a fine introduction for a beginner.

" after a quick internet search i found many reviews on amazon as well as several other sites for this book and called in an order for it at my local barnes & noble that same night. dr. whitley has written this book in the most responsible and informative way without having to charge his readers for individual sessions! in my opinion this is a must read not only for parents of underachievers but also teachers and counselors. we have always tried to stress the same learning structure and goals as the teachers. however if at home you are on dr. whitley's 10-step track and the teachers are still on a reward and punishment system - the parent needs to be proactive in dealing with the teachers and endeavor to obtain their support as a united front. although the steps may seem to be a cumbersome process at first read and initial implementation - the constant image of mr. rogers in the back of my mind is quite calming and thus the process can become a destressor for the parents. of course that may not be so for those parents of hard cases where the child is at the stage where he/she is capable of frightening resistance. obviously professional help with someone in-tuned with dr. whitley's methods would be more advisable than his book! to me - this book is for the parents of students in 6th grade or less - and possibly 7-8th graders. these kids still have some moldability and aren't as likely to have other serious issues that could be the source of the problem (i.e. depression). for the grammatically correct - the substance of the content of the book far outweighs any such errors that are more the fault of the editors than the author;0) ",positive

" the climb was written by bourkeev and dewalt as an answer to krakaur's into thin air. while not showcasing the same prose as krakaur's book i feel that this is utlamitely better. my reasoning for this opinion is that the climb seems like a much more fair and unbiased account. bourkeev does not resort to playing the blame game; he simply tells the story as he experienced it. krakaur it seemed to me at least relied to heavily on assumptions and we all now what happens when you assume (hint: you make an _____ out of you and me) and came off as very arrogant and (for some reason) took a feverious dislike to bourkeev and lopsang. thought not as well written as into thin air the climb still managed to draw me in fully although some parts of the book are a little confusing mainly the interview with bourkeev about his single handed rescue of three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed. this interview was conducted in english the only problem with that is that bourkeev's english is not very strong! it is passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other parts it is very hard to dechyper. dewalt tries to help by adding translations about what bourkeev is saying but i felt the interview should have been caried out in bourkeev's native tongue of russian and then translated into english. to not have done this is a great injustice to bourkeev. if you want to read a fair and unbiased book about the may 1996 everest tragidy that was written simply to tell the truth and not to play smeer tatics and make money (as krakaur's clearly was) read this. i really recommend you read both books though and also check out the imax movie everest.

" i once read an article in horn book magazine (a review source of titles and articles on children's literature) that lamented the millions of poor translations of hans christian andersen polluting the minds of our young people today. the review mentioned that stories like the snow queen which were originally written in a snappy vernacular have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their american translators. with this idea fresh in my mind i found myself in possession of a very particular copy of the snow queen and i was able to test this theory myself. now due to the wacky nature of amazon.com the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this anderson story. you will see that some of the reviews refer to nilesh mistry's some refer to the audio book some to eileen kernaghan's and some (god help us all) to mary engelbreit. none of these however are the version that i am reviewing. after careful consideration i selected the edition retold by amy ehrlich and illustrated by susan jeffers. the ehrlich/jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from thumbelina to cinderella. with this 1982 classic edition they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life. most people don't remember that the snow queen begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad. by a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day (the details of this accident are left unclear) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere. if these splinters enter your eye everything will look ugly to you. if they enter your heart it will turn instantly to ice. got it? good. cause sure enough two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named kai. when this happens he stops playing with his best playmate gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale snow queen. gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures. she escapes an overly loving old witch is taken in by a prince and princess falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin and at last saves kai from the snow queen herself. by the end of the book neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it. obviously the snow queen is one big ole story about growing up. the idea of the devil's mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart... well that's just another way of describing adolescence is it not? andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale east of the sun west of the moon in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman. heck tam lin was probably an influence as well. the best version of this particular story i ever read was by kara dalkey. it was a tale named the lady of the ice garden and can be found in firebirds: an anthology of original science fiction and fantasy. it is not however appropriate for children. kids today will probably look at the snow queen and instantly think of the white witch from the lion the witch and the wardrobe. i cannot think however that this is a bad thing. as for the jeffers/ehrlich version it's all right. as an illustrator jeffers has apparently decided to make kai and gerta definitely children. i guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the snow queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs. jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the snow queen's dress and every strand of her white white hair. there is the odd stylistic choice here and there though. when gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals. i can't think that they're comfortable (or even particularly practical). the illustrations have been created according to the book using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes. they were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased. as a result the book is as soft as a colored pencil but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink. obviously i don't know enough about the original version of the snow queen (or as andersen called it sneedronningen) to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots. at any rate it tells the full story warts and all and will provide them with what may well be the most freudian-toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains. a fun edition of a rather odd tale ",positive
" [...] if you are curious about the cambridge patonists patrides carefully edited selection of texts gives you the cream of the crop! - benjamin whichcote ralph cudworth john smith henry more et al. - material reprinted from the original texts complete with all the archaic but fascinating english spellings. the texts are fully annotated with comparisons and references to a wide range of cognate works. if you are reading the cambridge platonists as part of an academic exercise or are otherwise familiar with their milieu well and good. you will know what to expect. i think it is worth saying something here - for the general reader. i am sufficiently 'unmodern' (or perhaps 'un-postmodernist') to read the cambridge platonists because i think they still have something valuable to say! not everyone would agree with me - but i think the portrait of benjamin whichcote which graces the cover of this book (and the frontispiece) says something about the sort of men we are dealing with. (the portrait still hangs in the gallery at emmanuel college cambridge). there is composure in that expression. it seems to infuse the whole being of the man. it is the expression of a mind which has found calm waters seen eternal verities. one of the papers in this book - ralph cudworth's was preached as a sermon before the house of commons (i.e. the british parliament). things are different with us today. we are no longer certain of eternal verities. it seems almost incomprehensible - now to think that when the cambridge platonists were expounding their ideas in the 17th c. they were touching on matters of concern to most thinking people. religion and science had not yet parted company (despite being called a 'father of modern science' in school books issac newton was a deeply religious man very much in tune with the ideas of the cambridge platonists). the great beauty of the cambridge platonists is their calm confidence their utter conviction that there are eternal verities that reason and faith are complementary faculties. thus on the one hand they looked back to the philosophers of antiquity (strictly speaking they are neo-platonists taking in everything between plato plotinus ficino/renaissance thought even hermeticism) - and the legacy of christianity while on the other hand - they were alive to the emerging 'scientific' spirit the renewed quest to understand the principles ordering the phenomenal universe. for them there was an intelligent - and intelligible order in the universe. for them reason (capital r) still had its pre-kantian classical sweep. 'reason' was not a mere idea in the head an itching in the cranium but presupposed the divine nous (intellect) intimately connected with the activity of a divine energy (energeia)informing the pattern of the universe. we find them preaching against false religious 'enthusiasm' - as soundly as they preached against atheism. good men spiritualise their bodies; bad men do incarnate their souls. we are no more than second causes; and our suffiency is only in god who is the first. a second cause is no cause divided from the first. - benjamin whichcote.

" this book covers all the elements of game theory emphasizing intuition over mathematical formalism. the philosophical aspects are also given a thorough treatment. the 8 appendices provide a more formal exposition of several key concepts such as the minmax theorem the geometry of equilibria and linear programming. the book has not changed much since its publication in 1957 but it is by no means archaic. even for those who have a modern and more rigorous textbook &quot;games and decisions&quot; is highly recommended as a supplement. there is something for everyone in it ",positive

" this is by far my favorite novel by forster and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels period. in his first book forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which i at least feel that he lost as he got more self-consciously &quot;philosophical&quot; in later books like howard's end and a passage to india. he makes wonderful use of the italian settings and of italian art bringing them to vivid life undermining tourist cliches and weaving them gracefully into his main themes. no other book i know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly ",positive

" peter balakian's book black dog of fate tries to be too many things and sadly fails at many of them. in essence it is an attempt to tell a sort of armenian-american story which i find not overly interesting or compelling. i wish the author had done a bit more in-depth work to learn about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it or explain it or share it with non-armenians for he has much more to absorb and understand himself first. i find the armenianness in this book to be tentative unengaged and unconvincing. pity since the author seems to have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as football the yankees modern poetry and exposing turkish attempts to buy (among others) princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism practiced by the modern turkish state and its organs. it seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels. the i and we and us occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice. but is it realy? since in order to make this legitimate the writer must distance himself at least initially from all this old world exotica and like the reader question their validity or relevance in present day north american society. what are all these old world old fashioned ghosts and traditions? is the first cry of writer and reader alike only ofcourse to be followed by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in-place reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein *this* culture and *this* lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards materialistic memory-free self-redefining comfort seeking and buying mores. in the balakian tale one encounters suburbia instead of substance worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either towards surrealism the abstract and unemotional or else towards medicine respectability and detachment. young balakian observes but never understands the grandmother for she is shielded culturally from being able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill the armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find. their crime is self-denial and a march to the tune of america's mixmaster piper. be unlike your past and your future will be brighter seems to be what america promises at the very least. the intermediate generation listens and adopts this credo and peter is left to find out but never quite understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain armenian and to preserve our culture before the final denials on new jersey pateos while enjoying as if to serve sweet irony full course armenian meals and the mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every sunday. peter is lost alright but as the book sadly shows he remains lost. paraphrasing or quoting ambassador morgenthau does not an armenian genocide expert make. personal family testimonials of the turkish atrocities does not a genocide history make (for that read vahakn dadrian's the history of the armenian genocide berghahn books 1995). episodic accounts can be dismissed by the turks as hear-say and as mere isolated incidents leading to more harm than good (for if better evidence existed the arguement goes why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare?). for the story to have worked for the story to have *really* worked as i would have liked it to balakian's life and lifestyle would have had to have changed significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect it and his relationship with his wife who like him is not leading a strongly armenian existence would have had to have changed solidifying his roots celebrating his new found identity and nurturing the metamorphosis by sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation which alas never appear on the pages of this book. how else to explain the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which balakian is a grand personal witness except that the transition has not occured? the ship of armenianness sails by balakian. he is finally aware enough to be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it but not resolved enough to climb aboard. that is how the book fails and that is how his story fails. this is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of mid stream self awareness thrown in. for a real story of an armenian finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future read mark arax's book in my father's name (simon & schuster 1996) where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite frankness and power by mark arax. one can only hope that balakian's partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer (not withstanding his laudible actions as an april 24th -- armenian genocide commemoration speaker and an exposer of turkish infiltration in the us academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as unbiased researchers). this criticism i direct to the predecessor of this genre of american armenian writing first and to balakian second. i speak here of passage to ararat by michael arlen (hungry mind republication 1996) where a disinterested soit-disant armenian goes to armenia in the 70's and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by this strange people's woes and dreams. too little too late and always detached is all i can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural reorientation. much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is transmitted to future generations to take and behold. however i remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic identity survival stories *will be* written which will show that the tide of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we proudly call our home ",positive

" typee is based on melville's experiences when as a young man of 22 he jumped ship from an american whaling vessel on the island of nukuheva in the marquesas islands of the south pacific. it is written in a straightforward narrative manner but it is a work of fiction not a journalistic report something that is often overlooked. while like moby dick it contains lots of factual details mostly quite accurate as confirmed by subsequent research it is a much more complex tale than it appears to be on the surface. for a first novel written when melville was only 27 years old the narrative power is quite impressive as for example in his description of the escape from the ship over the mountains to the valley of the typee. in the early chapters themes of peace beauty and sensuality are combined with melville's righteous indignation at the activities of western military and religious intruders to create the illusion of an earthly paradise. gradually dread loneliness horror and fear of annihilation come to the fore as tommo the protagonist becomes convinced that he is being kept for eventual eating at a ritual cannibal feast. he is finally rescued almost by chance and because of conflict among the typees. i read the oxford world's classics paperback edition which has an introduction by ruth blair an australian professor of english. it was very helpful with melville's historical and literary sources and the geographical and cultural context. the chapter on typee in studies in classic american literature by d.h. lawrence adds a further depth of understanding. newton arvin's biography of melville helps to place typee in the development of melville as a writer. highly recommended in its own right as a superb example of 19th century american romanticism with hints of the impending metaphysical explosion of moby dick ",positive
" i first purchased this book when i was a freshman in college seven years ago. it is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing i have ever read. i love the plastic tabs that mark each section. this guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section. so for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape etc using the mla style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab. i have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother - a freshman in college. i really wish i had this book when i was in high school. i highly recommend this book to any high school college graduate student or writer. i especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities i myself have add and before i got this guide i could not understand how to write a paper in the mla style or in any style other than a book report. i promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published ",positive

" has there ever been anyone like richard nixon? for sheer resiliencyhe stands alone in american history. no one won bigger than richard nixon. and no one lost bigger than richard nixon. and then won again. and then lost. and won again. he just kept punching and planning and working to eventually become one of the dominant figures of the 20th century. the author of 9 books 8 of them best-sellers this is his firstand covers six major crises of his political life to 1962. this is serious history but so well-written that it reads like an exciting novel. in it you can see the raw steel of the man emerging through his discipline beginnig with his first crisis as a 35-year-old freshman congressmanthe prosecution of alger hiss the darling of east coast liberals and the state department as a soviet spy.. the other crises have been well-described by other reviewers but all were thrilling examples of courage (backed by preparation) under fire. highly-experienced washington veteran david gergen who worked closely with four presidents in his excellent book eyewitness to history described richard nixon as the toughest man i ever knew. in this book you can see why. interestingly his overwhelming love of country shines through as well. for examplethe 1960 election was unbelievably close.a swing of only 11000 votes properly distributed and the election results would have been reversed. and there was verifiable vote fraud by the democrats especially in texas and illinois. nixon was repeatedly urged to demand an investigation and recount. he refused. firstit would have greatly delayed the transference of responsiblity to a new administration. but secondly as he wrote then too the bitterness that would be engendered by such a maneuver on my part wouldin my opinion have done incalculable and lasting damage throughout the country. there speaks a patriot. and a man! also recommnended.nixon in winter by monica crowley ",positive
" i'm in love with the impressionists in general and with auguste renoir in particular. his palette is full of light; soft pink greens and blues are a joy to watch time and again. as most impressionists renoir paint wonderful every day scenes mainly outside as his magnificent: the luncheon of the boating party (1881) the swing (1876) and le moulin de la galette (1876) whose careful reproductions are shown here. he was an artist that loved life and wanted to reflect it as he perceived: full of little moments of simple joy and relax. he was also a masterful portrayer as you may see from his on the terrace (1881) in the cover of this book or two girls in black (1881). another subject that attracted his fancy was the dancing couple which he depicts with tenderness and accuracy. it doesn't matter if the dancers are from the high class as in city dance or commoners as in dance at bougival both from 1883. at the end of his life his paintings evolve and produce for our delight: seated bather (1914) and the nymphs (1918). his life and works are described and commented by the author with keen penetration and endearment. reproductions are awesome and do justice to the artist. do not miss this book! reviewed by max yofre.

" this was a required text for one of my graduate courses and i didn't expect to enjoy it much. it wasn't far into the book that i began to resonate with some of the struggles for racial harmony articulated by perkins and rice. in chapter 1 spencer perkins states emphatically the civil rights movement has run its course and we've gotten just about all you can expect to get from a political movement. i a white guy took offense at the thought that someone would declare the struggle for civil rights obsolete. his point is well made through the development of this and subsequent chapters. the move toward reconciliation must move from race to grace. regardless of your religious affiliations if you are engaged in civil rights causes or racial reconciliation you would be remiss to neglect this ground-breaking tome. pax erik ",positive

" this very fascinating book is a story written in the form of numerous letters and personal diary entries made by the principle character of the book. it chronicals the life of a young scottish woman forced to live first in china then japan. well written and historically accurate it's obvious the author is intimately familiar with the the culture customs history and life style of japan. this makes the book that much more interesting and fascinating for those who enjoy realism and demand accuracy in a story. for all who've ever lived in japan it's a believable tale that literally makes you feel you've stepped back in a time machine to witness the birth of modern japan. for those who haven't lived in japan believe that the author has done his homework and is not simply just creating a fictional setting in his mind. because of this he's able to focus on his character versus scene/setting development and thus creates a living breathing person in your mind. the timespan covers over 40 years as the story weaves through her trials and tribulations and shows how her fortitude and strength serve her through tumultuous events in her life. a gripping tale that draws on your emotions and has you constantly rooting for her. when the last page is read it leaves you wishing the story would continue but even good books must end. be prepared to sit a spell. once you start reading you'll find it hard to put down ",positive
" i bought this together with a best of cd both containing a lot of songs i really wanted to play on the piano myself. that combination has allowed me to hear what vince played while also reading through the music to see just what it is he played. without exception i've found the written music exactly true to what vince recorded including pick up notes tricky min-maj-min progressions arpeggios diminished 9th chords and what-not and it has made some previously unapproachable passages much easier to understand. i've also been able to use the book as a sort of learning tool getting a feel for what a jazz musician really tries to accomplish when he sits down and plays a piece. i would like to have seen some fingering indications included and without those i think some beginners will not be able to do much with this work. and personally i didn't find the performance notations particularly useful (laid back doesn't really convey much to me) but like i said i also purchased a cd of vince's music so i already have an idea of what sort of sound i want to achieve. other than those two minor points i can't find anything wrong with this edition. the binding is lay flat perfect bound so the pages stay glued together but pull away from the spine allowing this book to retain a crisp appearance and feel even after the pages are pulled open on a music stand. guaraldi fans and aspiring jazz pianists will gain a lot from this work ",positive

" anyone who reads this book would not be surprised at the runaway success of the &quot;left behind&quot; series since it demonstrates that a preoccupation with bible prophecy affects a much wider demographic than the fundamentalist subculture. indeed the impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the reagan white house. and christian or not who hasn't heard of the term &quot;antichrist&quot; or the significance of the number &quot;666&quot;? this book presents a fairly comprehensive survey of popular eschatology including the role of israel russia the arab countries europe and the united states. it also shows how those beliefs have changed over the years (turkey was considered gog and magog before russia was and the pope was designated as the antichrist for years before hitler and henry kissinger came along). the final chapter written at the brink of the collapse of the soviet union demonstrates how once again premillenial thought adjusts itself (or sometimes not) depending upon world conditions. this is a fair even-handed treatment of a religious and cultural phenomenon ",positive

" this book contains the childhood memoirs of peter reich. as the son of psychoanalyst wilhelm reich peter led a bizarre life. he lived with his parents on the family estate of orgonon in the backwoods of maine. not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy. as wilhelm's only child peter was one of the first recipients of reich's therapy methods which involved special forms of touch energy channeling softening the stomach and inducing vomiting (in peter's account). peter was also made lieutenant in his father's defensive squad that protected the earth from ufo attacks through the use of accumulator guns. the elder reich eventually got in trouble with the fda for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness. the court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court. not long after being sent to prison he passed away apparently of heart failure. upon his father's death peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father's legacy of brilliance and madness. up until the time of his father's death he had believed everything his father told him not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father's version of reality was from most other people's nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father's explanations and standard scientific approaches. in this book peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not what is his and what is his father's. the book reads like the proverbial onion-chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another. sometimes it's hard to tell if what peter is describing actually took place or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head. by the end of the book the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in peter's mind but like peter may not be capable of saying what really happened. in any case this is very much a book about peter reich and not wilhelm reich although readers who want to learn more about wilhelm reich may find some clues to his ideas through the interpretation of his son who experienced them first hand and without question ",positive
" this book is a must for anyone who works with older adults. it is a photographic essay of some very special people....people who embrace the robustness of life and who are disciplined to maintain their capabilities as long as possible. our world is steeped in ageism that is believing that older people are only capable of doing things that are &quot;appropriate&quot; for their age. this book shatters those beliefs and provides living examples of people who continue doing what they love to do physically. i wish that etta clark would revise this book with a new set of photos every year! i have seen some of these photos over and over again in lectures that people give about aging. it is a book to be owned not borrowed ",positive
" this book is a celebration of color and the watercolor medium. turning the pages is like watching a fabulous fireworks display. each page reveals another explosion of beautiful color painting. like fireworks some paintings go off with a huge bang and others are more muted; but each painting has something to say -- there are no &quot;duds.&quot; helpful comments by the artists give insight as to how and why each painting was done. if you're an artist looking for inspiration this book can really give you a whack in the side of the head that will send you running to your paints. even if you're not an artist you'll enjoy the gorgeous colors and wide wild variety of subjects and techniques. an astonishing book and well worth the price ",positive
" from what i gather edward abbey has somewhat of a cult following. i had never read anything by the guy never even heard of him before i got this book. i just thought i should point that out before going on. this book kept me reading no doubt about that. it has it's downsides but overall i'd reccomend it. not hey you gotta read this right now but it's good if you're looking for something a little different. this book kind of made me think. i'm not the kind of guy who is always reading into a book trying to analyze every aspect of it. but i couldn't help it with this story. i thought a lot of it was psychological dealing with the main character his thoughts attitudes and what made him tick. this is a fairly long book but the actual story of the guy going back to his hometown is short. the plot alternates every chapter-- one about where he presently is and then a memory then where he is then another memory and so on. although it was an interesting way to write the book i thought some of the memory sequences dragged a bit. but don't get me wrong overall i did enjoy them. if you're looking for something that might be able to fuel a couple of thoughts about life this is a good bookt to pick up ",positive
" angela davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era. this autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood. her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison. one factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a 5-star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman. she focuses entirely on the black power movement. in closing this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves ",positive
" the story is about peter growing up with his family in north dublin and is set in the 1960's. the tightly knit family relations with his own family and those of his extended family of lodgers which his parents took in to supplement his father's income forms the backdrop to his story at 44 seville place. the pace of the book has the rhythm of the sixties. the short sentences beat out the rhythm of the sixties and keeps the tempo up-beat throughout the whole of the book. for those who have experienced dublin in the sixties this book will take you back to that place and that time. the metaphorical pieces were very touching and masterfully executed. one example of this technique was when peter tries to get to grips with his emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother frankie before frankie goes into surgery. a joy to read. da is the sun and all the minor planets revolve around him. peter takes to his role as mercury the messenger with great relish. there is a strong bond between father and son. i feel this story should not be compared to frank mccourt's angela's ashes. a one generation step into the future in ireland can make a very big difference in how life is experienced. it was a very enjoyable read whereby the need to laugh out loud in places could not be silenced. however there were places in the book where the need to cry out loud could also not be silenced.

" . . .maybe believe your suspenders i'm not sure which. it seems to me that to enjoy this book you have to suspend your suspicion of bombast and improbability. you also have to give up any qualms you might have about a protagonist who's pretty much a pedophile and whose connection to planet earth seems pretty improbable. what you get in return are some amazing language some great observations and a character whose zenny zest is intense but not cartoonish. much too cerebral to ever be made into a movie by any director alive now this is a book to be enjoyed as a pure artifact of whacked-out but craftsman-like writing ",positive

" for a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment this book was a pleasure to read. the concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation. however i specifically enjoyed how steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports. from establishing values to finalizing the contract this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process. also at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading. winning with integrity isn't easy in general let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents. leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book ",positive
" this classic chronicle of presidential campaigns from the get-go to contemporary times has the unusual virtue of being useful either as a collection of short readable chapters - each just the right size for a daily bus or train ride - or as a reference source. reading this in the wake of monicagate and the florida recount it's instructive to read the history of grover cleveland who seems to have features of both past democratic candidates. like clinton he had his scandals - fathering an illegitimate child. like gore his career was rudely interrupted by an election which he won on popular votes but lost in a hotly contested knife-edge electoral college tally ",positive

" i was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality. blamires had c.s. lewis as a tutor and i've read some of lewis's writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special (many people do find his works special of course). blamires on the other hand i find to be very unique - his book is top quality and very helpful. i'm surprised this isn't a very popular book as it ought to be. i have only two complaints both of which are purely stylistic. first the edition i have looks like it's a copy of an earlier edition which makes the text hard to read (i got used to it after a while though). some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it. my second criticism is something that can't be avoided - the book was originally written in the early sixties so a lot of the examples are dated (i.e. references to wwii which was still in memory also out-of-date terms like jive etc.). however just a few of the examples are affected by this. the book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work since so much blamires's criticism of the christian mind (or lack thereof) still (sadly) applies. however the christian mind today is being rediscovered and the march of atheism is on the decline with the march of religion in general on the rise. even though things are looking up christians should keep blamires's book in mind - not to get too comfortable with this (secular) world for our real home is beyond bodily death. that we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book. superb book and i really recommend this to anyone. this is definitely recommended for christians and also for any non-christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems christians have today ",positive

" more than anything else alan furst recreates the atmosphere of the early days of world war ii espionage. i.a. serebin inhabits the urbane world of russian emigres in the europe of 1940-1941 mainly in paris but also in roumania. serebin is recruited into what seems to be the british secret service and seeks to interrupt the flow of roumanian oil to the nazi war machine. the whole operation reeks of amateurism - appropriate enough at that stage of the war - brainy careful daring but amateur. with one exception none of the players know completely what they are part of - which also leaves the reader at times groping for the story line. still furst's prose forms the characters into full-dimensional beings from bogart's casablanca or graham greene's human factor. highly recommended for readers with an interest in espionage or ww ii ",positive
" i ordered this book primarily for the benefit of my 7 year old son. we're doing a research project on oceans and while we have a few good resources i felt this one with its 3d imagery would more likely capture and hold his attention. what i didn't realize was how thoroughly it would capture and hold mine. for me 3d had always meant multicolored plastic glasses and headaches. though the book was described as stereoscopic i didn't understand what that meant. stereography was something new for me even if as a form of photography it is over 150 years old. this is not a matter of red and blue separations; the 3d results from the human eye's trick of blending 2 photos taken (simultaneously) an eye's width apart. photographer mark blum is a pioneer in the art of underwater 3d photography and his work is beautifully displayed here. everyone i've shown this book to has been fascinated by it and i fully expect that when we've finished with our project the book will find its way to permanent display in my home ",positive

" this book reveiw is on a book named last summer with maizon. this book is about two best friends named margarate and maizon who lives on madison street. her friend maizon was accepted to blue hills a school where really educated people go. margarate does not want them to be separated. every night she wishes maizon will not get accepted. but when margarate's father has a second heart attack he dies and now all margarate has is maizon her mother her little brother jay and the people around. margarete was having a rough time anyway and then maizon got accepted to blue hills. when it was time for maizon to leave margarate her mother and maizon's grandmother dropped her off. when maizon wasn't there with margarate her whole life changed. at school she was becoming popular she was liked now. days passed by and maizon still didn't call. when margarate went to go get her brother at her neighbors house that's when maizon calls. margarate was so excited that maizon wanted to come home. margarate ran to the grandmother's house telling her the news. margarate said maizon wants to come home the grandmother says that she would go get her. when maizon got home it was like old times they ran into each others arms. they then went to their favorite spot and started talking. maizon said she came back because she wasn't being treated right she didn't feel the same. so they sat there and talked and felt like old times with my best friend maizon. i think that this book should have gotten an award or five stars. this book has mostly everything of real life. it deals with best friends for example like my friendship with kiena. it has separation like my sister and me. it has a lost loved one like my godfather and it has a lesson like when you do wrong and learn your lesson. i think that this book should have five stars because it really relates to real lifeit shows friendship and it shows and explains what happens in real life. i like this book because it reminds me of my life me and my friends how we argue and lose our friendship and then gain it back with a little talking. it reminds me of how i lose people in my family and then cry because i miss them. if i could buy this book i would let my whole family read it i would make it our reference book for when we need advice or something to do. this book is so good that all my friends wanted to read it. it is so good that i really read it because i don't really read books and when i read the book it made me think of when my best friend ariel was going to move and how it made me feel and how i compare it to margarate and maizon. this book is excellent the author really put their heart in it and that they were depressed and needed a friend. if you ask my best friend johnniece she'll say that she really enjoyed the book that it should get five stars because the author really put thought confidence respect love care and her whole heart into this book. when i say she put confidence in this book i meant that she wrote it knowning that it will be a hit. the author thought about the words thought her life and compared it and started writing it with compassion. i think that this book should be the book of the month in my school because it shows and teaches a lesson. with the summary i wrote i put my heart in it because when i read it it touched my heart. i won't want my friend away from me. i think that i mostly relate to maizon because when she left margarte was beginning to be liked and the girl was talking about maizon and margarte sat there and watched and listened instead of doing the right thing and telling them to stop doing that to their friend. i relate to maizon i relate to her because if people don't like me i don't care. if people want me out of somewhere then i'll leave and if people love me i love them back and that's how maizon is. she doesn't take junk. alot of people relate to maizon. this book is interesting and gets interesting as you read on. this book is really a good book that shows you friendship break-up and everything else that deals with real life. i love this book it is really good and i think that if most people had this book then they wouldn't be out doing the stupid and illegal things that they are doing. this book really didn't grasp dr. kings dream because when maizon went to blue hills the whites were treating her bad they saw her different. brenliniqua class 7-512 ",positive

" in self-hypnosis for women c. alexander and annellen simpkins have created an instrument a book and cd combination tailored to both the novice and the familiar practitioner of hypnosis. the simpkins have masterfully crafted this guide to self-guidance weaving explanation and experience throughout the written and spoken words. provided are tools useful in addressing a wide array of events familiar to most on the journey of being human. while true to its title self-hypnosis for women offering examples of utilization directly fashioned to experiences idiosyncratic to women: menstruation pregnancy labor and delivery and menopause the title of this work belies its more universal applicability to components of life common to both women and men: self image; pain management; overcoming fear and anxiety and finding personal balance. the book is prefaced with instructions on gaining the most benefit for individual readers. those who may wish to skip over the more basic instructions are advised to begin their journey in later chapters. those who are new to the practice of hypnosis or enjoy viewing the history and techniques from others' perspectives are offered just that in the earlier chapters. the story of hypnosis and the modern history and research of hypnosis take the readers back to the early stages of identified systematic trancework from mesmer charcot and freud to the contributions of hilgard hull and milton h. erickson; they then procede to accompany the participant on the journey through current and future directions including their own paths on which they are about to embark. the simpkins define suggestion as a process by which a stimulus is accepted and then transformed through unconscious processing into an action experience attitude or concept. (p.45) this presentation of suggestion sets the stage for an environment conducive to the development of a personal ability to self-guide. together the book and cd promote the utilization of both conscious and unconscious processes as learning tools assisting in the transformation from less popular emotions such as fear or sadness to components of life which offers guidance and assistance. specific hypnotic techniques are explained and accompanied by exercises which give the audience an immediate opportunity to begin experiencing and tailoring that procedure. the framework for these exercises is the suggestion of an experiment with that particular technique creating an environment for the learner to safely attempt each new activity with no possibility of failure. the only opportunity not offered is that of incompetence. there is only a place to try adjust and retry each experiment until the reader fashions their own skill set based on personal significance and comfort. more than a bonus the accompanying cd is a work of art on its own. again mixing explanation with experiential learning this auditory tool incorporates fractalization as a teaching method to assist the listener in entering and returning from graduated levels of trance exploration. a vast canvas is provided upon which the hypnotic partner can create motor auditory and visual experiences with encouragement and assistance rather than direction or interference a respectful approach not always found in self-hypnosis recordings. sharon mclaughlin ma managing editor milton h. erickson newsletter ",positive

" the author gave many thorough and enlightening illustrations on how communication breaks down &amp; what to look out for. after reading &amp; self-examination one could identify the areas for improvement &amp; learn from the methods prescribed. the first part identifies the types of relationships within the family. the second on developing god-honouring relationships dwelling mainly on the subject of communication. i was very much enlightened by the types of circuit jammers within the family. part three expounds on sustaining godly family relationships. it explains why families fight &amp; how to turn discord to concord. i am very much encouraged &amp; edified from the reading of this book ",positive
" i didn't expect to like this book after reading the first 30 of 196 pages. the graphic detail used to describe a murder and the early decomposition of two dead bodies made me wonder where in the heck this story could go. and more importantly why would i want to read it! where does the story go? it's a wandering timetable. we know the two main characters joseph and celice both professors of zoology married for 30 years are dead and the forward movement not only includes their ongoing decay but also their eventual discovery by police dogs and the introduction of their grown daughter syl as she copes with her knowledge of their death. it also goes back to when they first met as students sharing a study house at the shore. they are an unlikely pair and yet they come together through mutual attraction and what turns out to be a shared tragic experience and live--at least according to their estranged daughter--an unremarkable life. the timetable further allows the reader to relive the last day of their lives hour by hour from the murder back to the moment they awoke and decided to spend the day together at the very shore where they'd met some 30 years earlier. the layout of the story was brilliant and not in the least bit confusing. the language (british english) is both lofty and gritty--probably not unlike joseph and celice. some of the thoughtful insights about life and death are very very poignant. for example when syl contemplates the loss of her parents: ... her gene supplies had closed shop. their daughter was the next in line. she could not duck out of the queue. so she should not waste her time in this black universe. the world's small breathing denizens its quaking congregations and its stargazers were fools to sacrifice the flaring briefness of their lives in hopes of paradise or fears of hell. no one transcends. there is no future and no past. there is no remedy for death--or birth--except to hug the spaces in between. live loud. live wide. live tall. i thought it was a very elegant way of illustrating both the fact that life always goes marching on and the importance of our obligation to the dead (and dying) that we live life well. the title and thesis of the book are one and the same: being dead. highly recommend. from the author of a line between friends mckenna publishing group ",positive
" black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african-american studies a classic work of sociology that still resonates today. it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology however a school that today stands in some disrepute at least in some circles. indirectly it was the target of james baldwin's famous attack on richard wright in his essay everybody's protest novel. the claim of the criticism has been that the chicago school due to its insistance upon using a &quot;scientific approach&quot; merely reproduces the very terms under which african-americans have been oppressed--a claim that has proceeded under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno. still black metropolis is a landmark study and unfortunately many if not most of its observations and conclusions remain true today and in fact it could be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse not better since 1945 the year of black metropolis' publication--which lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above though perhaps it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society. since then as we know we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of those days; so much so in fact that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book. embodying american liberalism as it does--which counted as a grave sin thirty years ago--black metropolis may possibly be due for a fresh look ",positive

" if you like fantasy and are not acquainted with the works of andre norton then this is an excellent starting point. believable heroic characters and a well thought-out &quot;witch world&quot; combine to make for an enjoyable read. simon tregarth is transported through a mysterious gate into a world populated by people and other things not people. a struggle goes on between good and evil and it's not clear who is winning. (but we know who wins in the end - &quot;good&quot; of course.) the style of writing - more of a story that unfolds as it is read - is one strength that characterizes her writings. that and the fascinating settings imaginative perils faced and strong likable characters make this a &quot;must read&quot;. this is a refreshing hard-to-put-down story. it does not suffer from the typical overinflated overwordy overcomplicated and overcharacterized (and lifeless) features of the usual fantasy megathon offered today ",positive
" we have now entered a second time of deep concern for the science math and technological education for everyone. the first one occurred after the sputnik fiasco when the russians beat us in the race to reach space. the concern now has risen due to what science groups such as the american association for the advancement of science and educators saw in comparison of assessments made of students in the u.s. and those in other developed countries such as japan. the answer to this concern was for the aaas along with other groups to put out a guideline as to what constitutes scientific literacy and what the public in the u.s. should at least know to be scientifically literate. as usual though the aaas addressed the fact that certain groups in the u.s. were not being 'included' in the pursuit of science literacy such as women and racial minorities in this their first book they skipped over those of us with disabilities. since this is a major concern of mine and the area in which i do research i was appalled to see they neglected 'us' once again especially as the aaas has a separate department dealing with the disabled/deaf. in spite of this mistake the writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and colleges as to what the teachers they train should know and be able to teach so that our country can be more scientifically literate. with new information being made available through newspapers and the internet on a daily basis it is absolutely imperative that all adults regardless of race gender or ability be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring of information to make decisions requiring informed consent in health care decisions on employment (since health care is one of the top employers in the u.s. today) and to teach their children. this book was the beginning but it isn't the end. more books have further elucidated what is required for science literacy from both the aaas and other science groups. this is the place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their students to become scientifically literate. karen sadler science education university of pittsburgh klsst23@pitt.ed ",positive

" i had no prior experience with music playing (other than blowing some simple tunes from a harmonica) and yet i found this book to be surprisingly easy to learn from. it smoothly and concisely guides the reader through the key elements of piano playing starting with one-hand playing but quickly to two-hands then chords etc. and ending with sharp and flat notes. it is well organized has well thought out exercises advices and a diverse collection of (short) attractive tunes of increasing complexity (from jingle bells to waltzing matilda to silent night to green sleeves to we shall overcome to minuet in g minor). i prefer it to other teach-yourself piano books that take much longer to cover the same skills such as the complete piano player or piano for dummies. i particularly like that it gets to two-hand playing almost right away which i feel is better preparation--even if it feels hard and slows the playing initially. it may have helped (coordination-wise) that i have been typing for 20+ years with both hands. if you are looking for a book that teaches all the essentials of basic piano playing in a thoughtful and concise way then i recommend this book. if you perfer a slower pace then maybe look elsewhere. for me this was the perfect book to learn from.

" the story walk across the sea by susan fletcher takes place at a town near the ocean. white people thought themselves superior to others especially the chinese. chinese were often looked down upon and shunned mainly because of their religious beliefs. the lighthouse keeper's daughter however was different from other white people. believing her father's talks about chinese people in the beginning of the story the girl eliza jane meets a chinese boy around her age. after the chinese boy saves her goat eliza becomes interested in the boy's behavior. soon she learns that everyone may not be as they seemed. this story was rather interesting in a way. the time of the story show how the characters act and think. the story also shows how different some characters are such as eliza's father and mother. (something moved inside me like a sudden shift in the wind.) eliza was also in a way different from other white people. she befriended and showed kindness toward the chinese boy. (`you'll do him no harm? i have your word on it?') i was also amazed by the twist of the story when the story reveals that the father truly worries about the chinese boy. of all of the stories i have read i have never found one that was perfect. this story is no different. when the chinese people were driven out of the village by angry white people i could feel the same shock and anger eliza felt. the story however has a few more bad parts. one boy amos accidentally broke eliza jane's nose while trying to find the chinese boy. afraid that he might get in trouble the boy lied to his father about breaking eliza's nose. to make matters worse amos blames the fault on the chinese boy! (i had a mind to shout at him to tell him to put her down...) on the other hand i did not like how eliza acted toward the chinese boy when they first met. when the boy yelled a warning eliza thought he was trying to scare her off so he could steal her goat. therefore when the boy was holding the goat eliza thought that he was taking the goat from her when what really happened was that the boy saved the goat from a wave. even so that was not the worst part of the story. (`get you from me' he said. `i can't be near you now. get out of my sight!') as a father eliza's father was expected by me to listen and talk to eliza about her chinese friend and maybe even understand why she was protecting him. as a result i was shocked and disappointed in her father when he told her that he did not even want to talk to her! thankfully there was nothing worse than this part of the story. (terrible things can happen in this world-things you can't explain away. it's not safe here andrew john. i can't promise you'll be safe. but there are miracles too-like you. and love. and glories well beyond our knowing.) the ending where eliza talks to her baby brother about life and the chinese boy was my favorite part. it ties everything together and concludes the story about friendship ",positive
" in 1995 the poverty level for a family of four in the united states was $19806. 37 million people in the us live at or below this level. ron sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth. in just generosity sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in america. and it is a compelling vision. sider's vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society's structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals. both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty. drawing upon biblical study sider presents the goal of an economy of justice: every person or family has access to productive resources (land money knowledge) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community (81). sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare minimum wage tax credits health care and education reform showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work empower the poor and strengthen families. sider ends with this troubling question: do enough christians really care? this book should be required reading for any that do.

" richard fortney's earth is a survey in mostly layman's terms of the geological history of the earth and how it relates to humankind. fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth selecting a series of locations where the earth's geology is apparent and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding. fortney starts at mount vesuvius in italy preceeds to the hawaiian islands hence to the swiss alps and to other locations aroudn the world. fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is. this leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the supercontinent of gondwana. for each location fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location. along the way fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes. the dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective. fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote. large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences. it turns out for example that the complicated geology of newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates (north america ocean bottom and northern europe). the descriptions of northwest scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by fortney's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the scottish highlands. the narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages and fortney's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader. nevertheless this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history ",positive
" this is an enlightening meticulous story of william boss tweed and as past of the context his three key cronies in the ring: peter sweeny richard connolly and oakley hall. it is a story about how the new york times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page. oh how the mighty have fallen! the time of power (terror?) for tweed's edition of tammany hall was relatively short but tammany hall power lingered well after tweed's demise another eithy-five years. the critical moment to the story is when tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal by devising a new charter for new york city putting the power in the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves. the four took this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves primarily by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have cost a few hundred thousand to build. a disgruntled 'whistleblower' (the term had no meaning back then) copied over the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and fraud. there are several versions of how the blockbuster story of the padded expenses and outright theft came into the times' hands but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen the ring could be how convinced they were of their own invincibility or ability to bribe cheat and steal their way out of any legal investigation or hearings. people who today believe we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed watchdog and people's friend -- the government -- can be part of the problem and a barrier to the solution. the cast of characters sinners (few) saints and masses of immigrants makes following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task. thomas nast a pivotal character if not the hero of the book provides some vivid visual signposts. nast not only draws a compelling picture for often illiterate 'readers' he was one of the first to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today's politicians. nast's giving tweed a face may have been one of the breakthrough aspects of this story. it certainly helped catch tweed when he jumped bail. a few maps perhaps some old drawings and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members of the cast. there are some historic new york times front page stories that help create atmosphere and context. any reasonably educated american should have learned at least the sketchy details of tweed's nefarious deeds and nast's colorful cartoons. ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing filling in the gaps and bringing now faded black-and-white characters back to life ",positive

(p.s. if you are a school librarian order a copy!!) - shelley (henderson nv) a fascinating look at a difficult topic! many viewpoints are presented the book is fair and balanced. but the stories of gun violence just naturally have more impact than those of kids who enjoy range shooting. the dichotomy between rural and urban viewpoints is striking. the wonderful photography really adds to the text. recommended. - diane (cedar rapids ia) despite the fact that i'm not really in support of guns it is nice to read a book on such a controversial topic that does not carry a political agenda. it's not your typical pro/con book either. it gives actual perspectives from real life people...teen people who just want to tell it like it is. - amy (fort worth tx ",positive

" time to pack up my luggage (wouldn't it be nice to have a suitcase like rincewind's?) and take off for discworld while the rain and gloom of a january thaw engulf the northern hemisphere. guards! guards! is the eighth book in the discworld series in which captain sam vimes of ankh-morpork's night watch gives up drinking and gets married (just the opposite of most folks). i don't read the discworld novels in order any more just pick up a favorite and start in. the blurbs on the back and cover pages compare pratchett to charles dickens (pratchett is better) chaucer j.r.r. tolkien with a sharper more satiric edge and p.g. wodehouse. i think any author who garners comparisons with such wildly disparate writers must be in a category by himself. heck pratchett is a category by himself. so on to ankh-morpork where the unique and supreme lodge of the elucidated brethren decides with a little prompting from its supreme grand master to conjure up a dragon. the dragon will cause enough death and property damage (including a vegetable stand and a brother-in-law's shiny new carriage) so that when the supreme grand master's nephew rides into the city with his sharp shiny sword and slays the beast the grateful citizens will proclaim him king. this plot works rather well except that the dragon decides that it wants to be king and cremates its would-be slayer. its requirements are simple and traditional: one well-bred virgin per month and all of the gold silver and jewels in ankh-morpork for its hoard. the new regime fires sam vimes from his job as captain of the night watch. how he wonders could things get worse? well at least he's not a virgin and no one is talking to him in capital letters.

" i recently finished reading this book. this is really a great book and gave me some insight into my own behaviour. it would be fair to say that this book has great value to those who get through first 3 chapters and understand the theory behind rest of the book. some reviewers have written about the validity of the theory iteself. while i am not qualified to comment on these reviews one thing i can definitely conclude is that this book provides a solid base to those who are trying to understand their own behaviour and trying to achieve improvements in it. a theory that too developed quarter century ago can not be expected to stand 100% vindicated today. the more importent question is what use you are trying to put it to. so may be for a psyciatrist this is not a great book but for a layman like myself this book explains most of the things. after reading this book i could find out why i behave the way i behave mostof the times. to a certain extent i learnt to control my responses. also i have a feeling that the claims made by dr. harris might be quite right in 1972 in light of the knowledge then prevalent. second objection seems to be dividing 5 or 6 billion population in 4 types of people. i think this conclusion is far from correct. dr. harris has repeated said that most of the people belong to i am not ok and you are ok category. out of the remaining 3 cattttegories 2 are shared by people who have not had proper childhood and the fourth is achieved by enlightenment of an individual. the objective here is not to merely categorize but to show that how most of us have the common position i am not ok and you are ok. now this should not be taken as a gross simplification of human nature but as a fundamental problem in human psycology that prevents one from producing rational responses. third critisism on this book stems from the fact dr. harris seems to quote philosophers with whom he does not agree 100%. it seems ludicrous to suggest that one must agree 100% with somebody else to merely quote a subsection which both of them agree upon. i don't think dr. harris wrote this book to declare to the world that he belongs to or believes in a certain academic thought 100%. the books surely derives from various thoughts put forward by various intellectuals (with whom he does not agree 100%) for the benefit of the reader. to call this approach pretentious is pretentious iteself. i feel that reader should not by biased by comments made by reviewers. read this book with an open mind. read the chapeters on pac and marriage pac and children pac and social implications pac and moral values. in this world that is becoming more and more crooked every other day it tries to teach something good (and this good is not subjective or relative but absolute). thanks ",positive

" jesse 15 lives in harlem new york city. he is the only child of a bright couple and his best friend rise is one of his biggest influences. jesse and rise grew up together. when rise 17 turns to crime and joins the counts a local street gang and insists on bringing jesse in with him along with their friend c.j. jesse starts to reassess their friendship. he sadly realizes that he and rise are traveling down different streets; the drive-by shooting of their friend bobby 14 has left the neighborhood shaken. c.j. a musical prodigy who plays piano in their church also has his sights set on a different path. it is c.j. and jesse a budding young artist who is quite talented at drawing who realize they have more in common with each other. rise and the counts are in for a count-down; sadly drive-bys claim more casualties. the counts were described as being on the tame end of street gangs; a warring faction called the diablos were responsible for shooting a friend; killing a cabbie and later some members of the counts. sidney a kind and fair police officer takes the boys under his wing. he is respected in the neighborhood and word on the street was that he was a fair man which he was. when mason 19 an older member of the counts was busted for homicide it was sidney who took rise and jesse to the jail (iron city) to see the fate in store for their former friend. more problems crop up in the neighborhood; rise seeing a chance to leave harlem wants to call jesse and the counts together for a final goodbye. sadly that goodbye really was the end. this is an excellent book that reflects the city and street culture well. the characters are fresh cutting edge serious and believable. the drawings were excellent and a bonus to this book. jesse an aspiring cartoonist created two west indian charcters a wise man and a bird. the bird was a metaphor for jesse and it is through this avian character that he asks questions in his drawings that wise answers. myers has written many excellent books but i think he really outdid himself with this one ",positive

" this is a very thorough very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the united states and while it may not be as easily readable as say david mccullough's &quot;truman&quot; it is certainly less dry and slow-going than most scholarly works. if you're looking for a full-life biography of monroe one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure's life this is an excellent choice. if you're looking for light reading with a historical basis this is definitely not what you're looking for ",positive

" roman by roman polanski is a very good book. it is very touching about his memories of his late wife sharon tate and their short life together. roman lost his wife and unborn child in 1969 by the manson group. he had a very hard life in poland during wwii. he lost both his parents during that time but he grew up to be a world famous director. the book tells about his struggles during these times and also during the period after the deaths of his wife and child. he tells about his hollywood days of directing his famous friends famous people and then what turned out to be his downfall...with the teenaged girl acusing him of sexual contact and him being arrested. to avoid persecution roman left the united states and has been in exile in france ever since but still directs and has released more movies. but the book is very well told and gives a good insite on roman's life and his career ",positive
" this book ranks along side will durant's story of philosophy as the best book on western philosophy. the key difference is that whereas durant deals only with some selected individuals russell gives a comprehensive history. topics that get the short shrift in most histories (pre-socratics medieval philosophy etc) are given the full treatment here. 'howp' has an authority that few can match. russell was a great philosopher himself - no history of western philosophy is complete without a chapter on him! the book is strewn with gems of wisdom: 1. the union of idealism and love of power has led men astray throughout history and continues to do so even today. (on sparta) 2. religions that condemn the pleasures of the senses drive men towards the pleasures of power. throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic. (on the clergy in the middle ages) 3. contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other people's happiness and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race. (on continental idealists) at times the book does get a little dense. there is only so far russell is willing to go to make the subject accessible to the lay reader. i would especially recommend this book for history buffs. russell dovetails the development of western philosophy beautifully with european history. there is no better way to develop interest in a subject than to read a book that connects it with a subject you are already passionate about ",positive

" yay--this book was fun and extremely informative. at first the idea of coloring at my age was a bit funny (to keep it humorous for me i conjured up in my mind a tall overgrown middle-aged male graduate student squeezed in a chair hunched back looking over a desk and coloring with his set of 64 crayons). anyway i digress. as a doctoral graduate student taking a neuroscience course--this book really helped me nail down structures of *way* too many things. but ultimately it helped me make the grade. if you get the book make sure to color in it--it really does help (not to mention a great way to relieve some stress from the day). otherwise what's the use of buying a book like this--it becomes an ordinary textbook if you don't color in it.

" i am at the mid-point of the book and will likely post another review when i am done. [...] the authors give the history and motivation and design decisions behind hla. they also give many good examples [...] allow you to get a really good feel for the important concepts of hla by running an actual federation. one thing i will be looking for is the impact of the architecture on simulation performance scalability in practice (as opposed to in theory) and how is hla likely to evolve over the next couple decades. i don't know yet whether the book is enough for you to create your first federation. if you really have no background at all in simulation you will still get a lot out of the first couple of chapters plus the many references to articles written on the subject but don't expect to find the other chapters easy. using my background in simulation systems i can say that hla seems to have been very well thought out based on real-life simulation systems and is therefore not trivial. but that's what makes it interesting and the book so far lives up to that ",positive

" this book immodestly bills itself as a unique compilation of useful information for architects. it is devided into six sections dealing with measure and drawing proportion and form codes and guidelines systems and componenets characteristics of materials and a catchall final section entitled a compendium. in turn each section is illustrated with wonderful line drawings and quick run downs of architectural details. i am doubtful that any architect or engineer would find this book helpful in their practice. the level of detail their professions require cannot be found in this slender volume. they rely on detailed encyclopedic volumes of construction details. this book is meant for architectural enthusiasts and non-professionals. i would recommend it highly for an owner who is overseeing a bulding project. this book is helpful in translating architectural and building terms into easily understood language. this volume would also be helpful to entry level general contractors interior designers and people trying to design their own homes. this book is a well written introduction to an area of study that requires years of training and access to very detailed volumes of architectural details.

" the theory behind this important collection of essays is that &quot;the history of medieval power is to be sought in microcosms.&quot; these essays demonstrate quite effectively that it can be found there as well. each essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships in twelfth and thirteenth century europe. at issue in each are the questions of what or who held the power to command or punish and how that power was obtained kept and manifested. this is a truly enlightening book. of particular interest are the essays on holding power over the truth as well as those dealing the formation of the nobility into a self-consciously chivalric warrior class. however all the essays are intelligent and useful explorations into the very nature and meaning of power. ultimately this book must be considered essential for any serious student of history casual or academic ",positive

" a commentary on a book of the bible will generally include the commentator's outline of the structure of that book. a good outline can greatly enhance one's understanding of a biblical book so such outlines are important. rarely though do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived. this book which is based on professor lee's doctoral dissertation describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text. this method called conceptual analysis is a modern version of form criticism developed by lee's advisor rolf knierim. lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes. one then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text. finally the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed. lee demonstrates the method on num. 10:11-36:13 a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways. he divides this section into 36 units discussing with each one the rationale for his choices. he then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is num. 13:1-14:45 the account of the exploration of the promised land by 12 scouts the largely negative report the scouts present to the people and israel's subsequent rejection of god's plan to bring them into the promised land. the pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section. conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a scientific process with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text. there is no way to completely mechanize such a process however. some subjectivity is inevitable and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others. in my opinion one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text. by this criterion i believe that lee's outline of num. 10:11-36:13 earns high marks. his outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text as he explains in the latter stages of the book. it is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists. this book is a notable exception and i enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of numbers.

" the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is the number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons. one it is slightly cheaper than others but most important is that it has the words'don't panic' written in bold letters on the cover. the story of the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy revolves around this remarkable book. this story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way. the last earthman arthur dent is saved by his best friend ford prefect who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of betelgeuse. they are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued by the heart of gold using the infinate improbability drive. inside they meet up with zaphod beeblebrox the two headed three armed president of the galaxy trillian an earthwoman who arthur failed to pick up and wnt with zaphod and marvin a parinoid android. this book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy. these adventures involve mice an abandonded planet a rather suprised sperm whale and the number 42. i loved this book for many reasons. one reason is that it is filled with unexpected humor. another is that it gives a good spin on life. i could always count on this book to cheer me up. don't just stop with this book there are many others in this series.

" i read this book even before it was assigned to my undergrad psychology class -- and then i read it again and enjoyed it both times. de wall does protest too much -- he's clearly answering his critics throughout -- but i found his curmudgeonly outbursts amusing. more importantly de wall's arguments for the existence of culture in animals are persuasive (not that i needed much persuading) and his use of anecdotes keep the book entertaining. i'm looking at my pet pooches in a whole new way these days ",positive
" as mentioned this book is amazingly compact cramming three semesters of calculus and a bit of ordinary differential equations into just 800 pages. that conciseness also implies that much explanatory material and many illustrative examples are missing. the authors mention in the preface that classifiers of calculus books would call this a traditional book. most theorems are proved or left as exercises to prove... nearly every result in this book has an accompanying proof. for those with a serious interest in mathematics this is a useful resource. for most others the presence of so many proofs can be overwhelming and probably is a turnoff. included with the book is a one-page detachable reference card containing a massive amount of valuable information including common rules for derivatives and integrals geometric formulas a few conversion factors trigonometric identities and graphs (very useful!) and more. the book also has a three-page comprehensive table of integrals in the inside back cover and a listing of geometric formulas in the front along with a commemorative timeline and portraits featuring the deceased european males who made calculus possible. given all of this i would highly recommend this book as an 800-page calculus reference text or maybe as a text in an honors calculus sequence that expects to use the text throughout multiple semesters - then using it saves you money. but for those who don't have a super-strong background or interest in math those who are just taking calculus for a requirement or those who have never seen calculus before or for those who are just plain math-phobic - using this book just doesn't make any sense. i wouldn't recommend it. for those who are stuck with this book for a course i'd suggest looking for another book to help you out. one possible book has already been mentioned in another review: silvanus thompson and martin gardner's calculus made easy a book that dates back originally to 1910 (!). i've read parts of it and the book looks good to me. i'm sure that there are many other helpful books; try checking your local/university library or looking on amazon for ideas. an extra calculus textbook that's more student-friendly might be a good idea. as for the pages falling out i haven't had a problem with it (i have the 8th edition) but i don't use the book all that much. i haven't found any serious errors in the text but i haven't read everything thoroughly having only used the text for calc iii. and yeah getting the student solutions manual would probably be a good idea ",positive
" reviewed by joanne benham for reader views (2/06) it's an ordinary sunday afternoon for odelia grey. an afternoon spent with her dysfunctional family means a stop at the grocery store on the way home to buy her favorite comfort food stouffer's macaroni and cheese to get the taste of her family (and her rotten date on saturday night) out of her mouth. and then she gets the phone call.....her dear friend sophie a staunch supporter mentor and banner carrier for bbw----big beautiful women---has committed suicide. as she struggles to cope with this heartbreaking news she has more disturbing news piled on. not only did sophie commit suicide she did it in front of dozens of eyewitnesses on her adult website!!! with the emergence of more hidden facets of sophie's life odelia finds it difficult to reconcile this new sophie to the sophie she knew and loved. as odelia digs deeper into sophie's life both past and present she comes to the conclusion that sophie would not under any circumstances kill herself. with backup help from a memorable cast of characters odelia sets out to clear her friend's name and in the process gains a new acceptance of herself as a fat woman in a thin society. this book was enjoyable on so many levels. first and foremost it is very well written. second it confronts the prejudice that is openly shown to fat people in today's society and gives a gentle nudge toward developing tolerance. and finally it leaves you impatiently awaiting the next installment in the life of odelia patience grey......the best new heroine to spring from the pages of a book in years.

" peter allen takes three of the most compelling aspects of human history--sex disease and religion--and weaves them together in a fascinating exposition of how religious authorities in the west have viewed disease since the late middle ages. his book discusses the histories of lovesickness leprosy syphilis plague masturbation and of course aids. for each disease (and yes masturbation was considered a serious disease well into the 20th century!) he discusses how sex and the sins associated with it figured into the religious and popular views of illness. allen's book is meticulously researched (he read texts in the original french latin german and italian) and elegantly written. it is a far easier read than most academic works. most importantly it offers insight into how religious and sexual intolerance can hamper the fight against disease even in today's world ",positive

" this book is a personal re-examination of food--what we eat and why we eat it. in this book prentice examines food customs and traditions searching for their physiological and environmental rationale. her primary observation about food traditions is that they are strictly tied to the seasons and thus the continual year-round availability of our foodstuffs has resulted in loss of much traditional knowledge about what is good for us and what isn't. in recognition of the essential seasonality of foods prentice organizes this book into the thirteen moons that make up the year from the famine moon to the sap moon from the egg moon to the corn moon from the blood moon to the wolf moon. each chapter describes the ecology that led to the association between a particular food item and a specific time of the year. in the chapters prentice discusses the nutritional contributions of the featured food items and how her relationship with that food has changed over the years. for example she explains how she used to avoid milk and other dairy products but now relishes them as a gift of love from mother earth. each chapter also includes recipes of the season ranging from exotic dishes of non-western food cultures like cardamom and jaggery pudding to simple directions for lost arts such as rendering pork or making homemade yogurt and sauerkraut. prentice was once a strict vegan who for health reasons eventually found herself drawn to a diet which includes animal products but not the products of industrial agriculture. there is much that vegetarians and vegans would not like in prentice's essays since she explains how her 10 years of vegetarianism were not healthy for her. having had the same experience myself after being a vegetarian for 20 years i can appreciate the wisdom in what she writes. while vegetarian diets work well for some they are not appropriate for everybody. but at the same time diets that include the consumption of industrially produced and processed animal products do nobody any good. we need to be willing to recognize our relation and responsibilities to the animals that we consume. i first heard of this book when i attended a vermont localvore potluck at which prentice was the invited guest chef. i was deeply offended then at her attitude when she announced she was going to make a salad using a recipe from her book but lamented the lack of local artichokes or olive oil. `how could such a person be associated with local cooking' i wondered `if she doesn't even have the sense to find out what the best local ingredients are and celebrate them instead of parading the products of another region in front of us?' i figured that a seasonal local cookbook written by a national author would be a worthless concept. fortunately that's not what this book attempts--instead the book is much more about rediscovering our connection to food than about specific local recipes. although she has become famous for leading the concept of eating foods only from one's local region what she urges here is really an appreciation for the products of small farms. thus instead of simply cheering on local food prentice argues in this book that our industrial agriculture system has torn us away from one of the most essential of human traits our relationship to the food that nourishes us. instead of following diets of avoidance prentice advocates recognizing the meaning that each item of food brings to our lives and using food to re-establish our connection to the land. indeed the only foods that prentice avoids are those heavily processed products of industrial agriculture: refined sugar white flour and pre-packaged extruded junk. although the book contains a few recipes it is not a cookbook but rather a wake-up call: our poor diet is at least partly a physical manifestation of a spiritual decay together with some suggestions of how we can begin the journey back to healthy eating ",positive

" rawlings explores the lives and interations of the odd assortment of people living in cross creek florida in the early 1900s. it is often assigned reading for teens but i doubt that most of them can appreciate it. her accounts of neighbors feuding and subsistance living gives us many lessons in human behavior. the lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing. your mouth waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush puppies. she turned those into a cookbook which i'll have to try out. modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the n----- word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible drunken immoral etc. it is probably a faithful representation of common thinking at the time it was written so recognize it as a snapshot of the times. then move past that to luxuriate in the beautiful passages in the book. (i deducted 1 star for this) the reader becomes absorbed in rawlings' love of the land and the creation of a home. it gives much the same feelings as a year in provence or under a tuscan sun ",positive
" i have always been a fan of the star wars saga but never really read any of the novels. this was my first sw novel. i must say i want to be a sith. i just finished this novel last night and honestly want a 2nd coming. if u read the epilogue of this book u will grind your teeth! the storyline at first felt familiar but then radically changed but had the sw ripple effects. i however got more excited because i played kotor/ep3 the game/kotor 2 and jedi academy so allot of the visuals and things in the book were already visualized for me in those games. i loved the entire transformation and how gradually even the sith were headed like the jedi in ep3. it an amazing story and can't wait to a sequel if any.

" i have got to say that this is definitely the best cheesecake book ever. initially i was shopping around for one since my boyfriend's favorite dessert was cheesecake. i ran across this and decided to get it. well one of the best choices i could ever make i think. this is an amazing book! starting from the recipes which are so numerous and so varied that they have to be divided into beverage-based chocolate vanilla candy etc. even one for light cheesecakes! honestly deciding which one to try the first time around was the toughest challenge when starting out. well i followed the instructions clearly as well as the first section on tips to avoid it cracking and boy did it ever come out wonderfully! i never looked back. i've baked from it endlessly for some years now tasting practically all of the recipes included. it's gotten to the point where i may soemtimes tweak the recipe and/or ingredients a bit and it still comes out great! my family has enjoyed all sorts of different flavors and many of my family members and friends have converted and use nothing but this to bake cheesecakes also. my copy is so beat-up from use it may be time to get a new one. did i mention that this is also a beautiful book? full of wonderful (yummy-looking) glossy pictures. my only (tiny) complaint is that on occasion some of the ingredients may be a little hard to get but nothing too major and definitely nothing's that stopped me yet. i do have other cheesecake books which people have given me over the years but due to simplicity astounding variety and plain old wonderful results this is the one i recommend the most.

" reading late james - particularly the golden bowl - often strikes me as being similar to reading a novel in a foreign language whose vocabulary you have mastered but whose grammar remains partially a mystery. anyone who has attempted this will recognise the sensation of understanding all the words yet not understanding how they fit together. you read a sentence two three or five times and it is only then that you understand if at all the meaning of all the words combined. sometimes the meaning never becomes clear. late james is a foreign language but one in which i have become more fluent over the years. when i first read the golden bowl some years ago i understood very little and did not enjoy it. the long convoluted sentences with so many things only half spoken - and often never spoken at all - seemed a vast and elaborate machine which never seemed to produce enough to justify its own existence. yet now having read most of james over the intervening years i have become more fluent in his language and find the circumlocutions complexities and ellipses of the late style if not exactly crystal clear then certainly much clearer and even rather comforting and enjoyable. the subtle discriminations the way james holds up to the light tenuous motives and turns them slowly - very slowly - so that their hidden facets become fleetingly visible; the very real portrayal of interesting characters that james reveals; as well as the languorous unpredictable turns of a jamesian sentence - all offer the kinds of pleasures that no other writer (possibly excepting proust) is able to produce. the golden bowl consists largely of conversations some continuing over many many pages. the content of those conversations would for most writers comprise the details between the main actions of the plot; and for most writers those conversations would occupy at most a few pages. but for james it is the interstices between big events the dramas not so much of everyday events but of the subtle daily manipulations the unspoken victories and losses of personal relationships which interest him and which comprise the novel. the subject of the golden bowl is the reciprocal marriages of father and daughter to a pair of former lovers. the novel is about the tensions and deceptions and the manipulations that arise as a result. who knows what about whom? who is responsible for what actions? who is deceiving whom and who has the moral authority as a consequence? ultimately who if anyone triumphs and is their victory a hollow one? these are the sorts of questions james is concerned with. the golden bowl rates as a great novel - one of the greatest of the twentieth century - because of these qualities as well as its ambiguities. it is also an enjoyable novel but to enjoy it you must first be sympathetic to the sorts of concerns james is interested in and you also need to be conversant in his distinctive language. both of these require - or at least i would recommend - first reading james' earlier and middle period works. for most of us late james can be a struggle but one which is justified by its rewards. i don't regard reading the golden bowl as an exercise only for academics pretentious aesthetes or literary masochists but i sympathise with those who do. giving stars to a james novel seems a little inappropriate (he is beyond these kinds of simplistic judgements) but i have given the golden bowl four stars because there are times when it strains the patience even of those who admire the writing style and enjoy the late james novels and i prefer the ambassadors or the wings of the dove. nevertheless the golden bowl is one of the great novels in english and is highly recommended to anyone who has read and enjoyed james' other novels.

" i had a chance to read this book cover to cover. all i can say is &quot;absolutely outstanding&quot; short of calling it a historical masterpiece in the field. very rarely do i encounter an epidemiology or biostatistic textbook that reads so well. it is optimally reader friendly; the author appears to have such a talent in explaining some most sophisticated epidemiological and statistical concepts in such a simplified language. yet he does not sacrifice the inclusion of some very advanced epidemiological and statistical concepts. new concepts such as causal graphs and instrumental variables are also included and explained beautifully. i strongly recommend this book to all early to intermediate graduate students majoring in epidemiology. established epidemiologists may wish to read this book to refresh and update their knowledge. i hope the author writes more textbooks with the same style ",positive
" this book is packed full of incredible devices for any one who enjoys exalted. the book has a wealth of knolage from the first age as well as the age of sorrows. the book has a few sections in it that divide the items by uses that is the only way i can discribe it. there is a giant amount of artifacts that have nothing to do with combat and then others that are. there is a section on warstriders basicly single man death machines that basicly look like large metal robots. most of the items in this volume are very well detailed and all have pictures that show you what they would more that likely look like. i don't like saying that is what they look like because well this is rping people things change by a player/gm's perception. anyway enough of my ramblings this book rocks and has items that range from pens to armor to boots to royal class warstriders. this book is about gear in the world of exalted. p.s. it looks like there is going to be about 4 more of these books. my best guess is that one will be for sorcery but that is just one book. if you think of anything else post it here to give me some ideas on the other ones ",positive

" i am not going to go over the contents of the book or much about charles bukowski because if you are considering this book you must know something about the man and his work. i will just give you my impression of this collection of work. no collection can ever really be complete there are always new things to add new commentary newly discovered works transcripts of records and unpublished letters but this book does an excellent job in its attempt. to me charles bukowski will always be one of the greatest american writers of the twentieth century because of the sheer brutality and honesty his work emanates. it is funny sad sadistic cruel scathing enlightening and thought provoking. everything i like to read. this is poetry for people who are disgusted by verse of flowers trees and greek mythology. this is raw human emotion and experience smeared out onto paper. it is not perfect and it is not trying to be. it doesn't always work but there in lies the subtle beauty of bukowski's efforts. the guts to try. the attempts at honesty clearly blocked by his unwillingness to divulge everything and his cynicism of man. this book has one of the most moving amazing and insightful poems...or anything else...ever written. it is called the genius of the crowd. if you read that work of art and are not moved...nothing will. this collection is shocking in its beauty and inspiring by its simplicity. enjoy ",positive
" though only a fraction of books have been written about the great war when compared to wwii there are some great ones to pick from. for instance for a great narrative of the american involvement in world war i try the doughboys by gary mead. for a good look at the events of gallipoli just last year john laffin wrote the agony of gallipoli which is a wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare. there is a great book which chronicles verdun called the price of glory by alistair horne. the list goes on and on whether it be flanders the somme passchendaele africa jutland whatever your area of interest might be. the point i'm making is there are plenty of specialized accounts of world war i and even several overviews of the war but john keegan's the first world war is a great source for an overall study of the war. this book covers it all in brief detail. accounts are given on virtually every facet of the war and even some of the best insight available for the events which led up to the war itself. every aspect of the war is given its due diligence here. i've never been a big fan of keegan. his writing to me is a struggle at times. this book is no exception. it reads somewhat like a 500 page textbook and borders on tedious at times. but as much as i dislike his stuffy british writing style he is a virtual historical genius. his knowledge and research of the events cannot be faulted and he writes for the most part without imparting his own commentary. in fact without prior knowledge one would hardly surmise that keegan is himself british. the big exception to that is keegan's typically british hard line stance of not giving the american forces their just dues. in this aspect he even contradicts himself in several places. he goes to great length to illustrate to the reader that in the early months of 1918 germany was still very much capable of winning the war. the western front had been bolstered by the arrival of german troops from the now defunct eastern front. the new soldiers from the east brought with them battle hardened experience and a mindset that they could triumph as they had in the east. he goes on to tell of how effective german advances had been in early april advancing a fifty mile wide front over twenty miles in a matter of days. he then follows this sort of information with telling the reader how though ambitious and courageous the american forces were largely inconsequential to the conclusion of the war. when he does acknowledge american victory it is quickly followed with excuses for the german forces. that said if you're seeking information about just how american forces rallied to bring an end to over four years of war in a matter of a few months this book will infuriate you. however if you are looking for a good overview of the war as a whole this is one of the best out there. i should add the book has a quite lengthy notes and bibliography section for further study. monty rainey [...] ",positive

" brooke dojny's new england cookbook: 350 recipes from town and country land and sea hearth and home is a stunning achievement a magnum opus of a cookbook. published by the harvard common press the book chronicles the cookery of new england from maine to connecticut from the first thanksgiving to the present. dojny's approach to the region goes well beyond new england standbys like clam chowder (although she offers three tempting recipes)and spans practically all the food traditions of all the ethnic groups who ever called new england home. the eight baked bean recipes in the book include one for cuban black beans and yellow rice and another for west indian peas 'n rice. new england cookery has embraced food from all over the world -- besides caribbean you'll find culinary influences of native american english portuguese italian irish german scandinavian greek french and hungarian cooks -- and all are represented in this book. yet for all its broadness of scope this is a very personal book; dojny's voice can be heard throughout in the headnotes sidebars and essays that describe the people and places associated with the recipes. the book is also a wealth of new england food history and lore as well as tips on cooking techniques and ingredients. bravo!

" horror master arthur machen's crowning achievement a still shocking compendium of interwoven short horror tales. in late 19th century london a scientist and an unpublished writer join forces as amateur detectives in an attempt to solve a minor but puzzling mystery which ultimately leads to the discovery of a truly diabolical conspiracy. in the course of their investigations the two men find themselves repeatedly surrendering their attention to a series of seemingly outlandish tales spun by an assortment of eccentric story tellers. the stories which all deal with imposture of some kind are only tangentially related to each other yet offer the somewhat bumbling sleuths important clues to the mystery at hand. machen builds suspense slowly and methodically masterfully leading the reader on to a completely unexpected gruesome climax. comical tragic sophisticated violent horrific and even downright disgusting the three impostors is a classic horror novel of sly deception and wit. the 1995 everyman paperback is the only critical edition of this remarkably rich book released to date offering a scholarly introduction (by editor david trotter) that carefully details machen's main influences (chiefly robert louis stevenson) and themes (imposture of various kinds also derived from stevenson). a short text summary nicely encapsulates the narrative's various twists and turns. finally a section entitled machen and his critics provides a welcome offering of mostly contemporaneous critical responses to this remarkable book; while many of these reviews were laudatory quite a few passionately outraged quotes reveal just how shocking the three impostors must truly have been in its time ",positive
