" the darn thing broke almost immediately. when i tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands! what a flimsy piece of crap. i just sent it back to amazon. i'm never buying a jabra product again ",negative
" i bought this for $30 from best buy. what a waste of money! the ear gels are comfortable at first but after an hour or so your ear starts to really hurt from it. the sound quality is terrible! people i am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my motorola v300. what is worse people i am talking to hear me very poorly. they say there is so much background noise it sounds like i am in a noisy bar even when i'm just sitting in my car. people can barely hear me over the background noise racket ",negative
" beware! the product features for this product specified a call answer and end button on the headset. the device i received did not have that feature. i selected this model because of the advertised feature. amazon.com's description was erroneous and misleading. i returned the item and was charged for the return shipping. i emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product. they ignored my email. in the online return process there's no option that states the return was a result of amazon.com's fault. basically they falsely advertise so that you buy the product and when you discover it's not the right one you're screwed. i now understand all those complaints i've read about amazon.com. i'll take the loss this time but i won't repeat my mistake and order from them again. buyer beware! this review is not so much about the product as it is about amazon.com's false description of the product. i couldn't use the product so sorry i couldn't give a review about it ",negative
" i purchased this item for use while driving my car in oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax. i was told it would work for the lg phones which is what i have i see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee i wonder why... i probable used this item a total of 8 times when i drove my manual transmission car i didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic. the jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well. while using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work. i emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails. i have a feeling i lose anyways with this purchase. the thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for lg cell phones iknow the one i got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch. to bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on ebay ",negative
" junk. junk. junk. mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working ",negative
" i went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. people regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.' ",negative
" design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor - people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound/ mic is not clear or muffled. find an alternate hands free- piece ",negative
" i owned two of these earbooms. the fit was comfortable and the sound very good. however after a month or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. i imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastic. the plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress ",negative
" i have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. however i constantly get complaints from whoever i'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. i have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. the problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth ",negative
" the gel inserts on the jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me. it's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this. also the insert comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert. sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end. i'm not happy with these ",negative
" apparently you need to &quot;know&quot; your technical specs -- universal does not mean nokia so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with nokia i get the expense of sending it back. this should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site ",negative
" i owned samsung t809 months ago and i was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work. yeah! it's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one. ",negative
" i purchased a brand new samsung t809 and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone. i went to a genuine t-mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit. the sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit. clearly a manufactuering defect by samsung. i contacted samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue the end result was that the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty. what?! end result i get to duct tape my battery in place. thanks. if you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product. clearly not samsung ",negative
" i got this phone basically for free but even taking that into account i'm pretty disappointed with the phone. this is my first samsung and i'm pretty sure my last one! i owned a nokia before and i regret that i betrayed it. from now i wouldn't get anything besides nokia and in the worst case maybe sony-ericsson. so here is a short list of those little things that make your life with this phone (and it's combination with t-mobile) annoying: - the keys are not comfortable to use. - it's not really comfortable to open/close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time. - putting a comma while writing a text message capitalizes the next word - what is the logic in that?! (it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot) - you can't set the camera shutter to be silent... - you can only save 1 phone type for each category - what if the person has 2 business phones... - you cannot choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address. and there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through like it would've been in a nokia (even in a model 5 years old!) oh yeah and t-mobile really contributed to the greatness of this phone removing some of the features and limiting others like setting your mp3 as a ringtone (although there is an easy hack around it: just change the extension from .mp3 to .3gp ",negative
" i can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is samsung could produce this giant pos. it's flashy yes. but does it deliver?? no. i actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off. i loved the clarity of the pictures even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy and i even liked the video feature. but the phone is only good if you can use it!!! it's been years since i've had such lousy reception from a phone. i'm considering taking the dealer to court over this since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was. i want my money back!! ",negative
" has to be the worst phone i have ever had to pay for. between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (i have to buy ringtones use their t-zone for the wap when i have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier. anyone who would charge some much for this pos really doesn't deserve my business ",negative

" i've previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers but found i rarely used the number of minutes i was paying for. a prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go and sti mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don't expire. i signed up and shortly after received my samsung phone. it arrived however defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged. per the sti mobile web site i contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone. this resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service. in the first one the rep told me that i was mistaken and must have been sent the wrong charger. no offer was made to replace the charger strangely which was included as part of the package deal. after additional emails where i reassured her that i did in fact have the right charger (i took the phone in to a local merchant who showed me the charger i was shipped worked with an identical model phone - it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective). at this point the rep apologized and told me i would have to contact samsung for a replacement phone! this entire process took several weeks. in short i guess you get what you pay for. if i had been shipped a working phone sti mobile probably would have met my needs but i was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider ",negative

" my motorola c139 with net10 crashed on me. i called net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone except they sent me this flip phone (v171). i liked my candy bar phone and didn't want this flip piece of junk. i was happy with net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing and then things quickly went downhill. net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone even though i had minutes available on the old phone. i gave my wife the v171 to use and took back from her our cingular phone which works awesome with no problems. she had problems all the time with the v171. she had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed even the local numbers. she also had problems trying to dial a number and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send. in my opinion the v171 is completely worthless. overall i am a very dissatisfied customer. my recommendation is to stay away from this phone and this service. go shop cingular for all the great deals they have ",negative

" i recently purchased this bluetooth scala-500 and used it all about maybe 5 times. why such a short amount of time? because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that i am told it sounds like i am in a windy tunnel when in fact i am in the car with the windows up and radio off. it's a bit too hot to drive with air condition off and windows up just so the person on the other end can hear me. now i keep this piece of junk in my console and will only use it if my logitech bluetooth is out of power. if you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere. the only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone. think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first. even with the rebate i only paid $[...] but still not a bargain. the one star was for the ease of setting up with my cell phone ",negative
" as soon as i bought it i realized it doesn't hold the phone too well. few days later my concerns proved them selves every time i made a rapid movement or tried to run with it (even very carefully) the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground. every time i was lucky to realize as soon as i droped it untill today when after coming home from shoping i realized my z520a is no longer with me. there goes a $200 phone lost because of a stupid $10 holster. do not buy this product if you realy need a holster go with something like sonyericsson's ice-26 that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosn't slip out of the holster. as for me i gatta get me a new phone shame i had the z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and i really liked it ",negative
" the skin is a great idea but it is not practical. it is too thick to work with the seidio cradle i have so i must pull off the skin to sync my treo. the skin buttons do not always line up with the treo buttons so i misfire applications. the holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time i pull the phone off the holster. do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly ",negative
" i was looking forward to the speck rubberized cover with some excitement however i was disappointed. while the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment after the first day it looks like it's two years old. if you have an sd card in your treo forget it -- the belt clip will pop your card daily. and the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt. don't even think about putting the treo in your pocket as the non-slip cover won't begin to slide into your pocket. finally the price at $32.95 is outrageous for a $5 cover. if you're in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover but for the rest of us...keep shopping or buy insurance ",negative

" i was with sprint for almost 10 years all told. i had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years. just recently without any warning whatsoever they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account...pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time. most of these pics were very important to me and are now lost forever.(i had only backed up about 45 of them.) i guess it was my own fault for trusting sprint but they offered no real explanation and when i tried to have the pics recovered not only could they not do that but they said they had no record of me ever having the picture account that i had with them for almost three years!!! this is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me! so my advice: don't trust sprint!!! again this happened with any warning! it could happen to you too! trust me: avoid sprint at all costs! i should have ",negative

" samsung has a great phone with the black jack. unfortunately the headset jack is not a standard jack but instead one unique to samsung phones. therefore you are forced to buy samsung's headset. bottom line -- don't bother. the design is horrible. the earbuds don't stay in the ear. what makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord. any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear. i hope that samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones.

" i enjoyed using this phone for some time. it was functional it felt solid and it had a nice low profile look. however after around a year and a half the continued act of opening and closing the phone has caused the hinge to crack and to gradually break off completely. i now have to hold the phone together with my hand while i talk which is extremely awkward. this is especially frustrating given the rest of the phone is so well made. furthermore it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my upgrade opportunity (in a couple of months) and right after my purchase of some extra accessories (batteries/chargers). search around online for a670 hinge and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine. this in itself wouldn't be a problem if samsung would willingly replace the phone. however they are not claiming it as a design defect and neither samsung nor verizon are offering to replace it. bad form for both although perhaps verizon isn't as much to blame. i would avoid both samsung and this phone because of this incident. this phone is seemingly designed to be durable but it frankly is not meant for the long haul and is too pricey given its average performance.

" excellent high-res lcd but the rest of the phone was a disappointment. poor overall interface with configuration options in non-intuitive locations. particularly disappointing was how it handled wifi. each application seemed to want to be tied to a particular wireless source. so i'd go home and try to get it on the wireless but i'd have to bring up the app let it spin a while be told it couldn't connect then i'd have to tell it to use the local wifi. it was just clunky. the poor utility of things like wifi mean that this is unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone and a very expensive an bulky one at that. i can check and respond to email far faster on my blackberry than i could get this thing to get an appication running and connected via wifi. much better wifi management is a must before i'd consider this phone. this is a serious example of one device trying to do everything and doing nothing very well. the device is relatively nice but i gave it two stars because a $500 price tag means it has to deliver. i bought and quickly returned the phone ",negative

" when i recieved this item i had mixed emotions for the product. on one hand the black finish looked very nice and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. also all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button) so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the qwerty keyboard. however due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials the case is very thick and bulky - when using the belt clip the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip but leans at an angle. but the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times i have dropped my cingular 8525 (which at such a steep price is not something i like to drop). the problem lies with the snap-shut system that closes the case. because the metal is so thin it does not secure very well and can come open pretty easily. to fix this i simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone so that it was much harder to both open and close the case. this for the most part solves the problem but it is still dangerous and caution is definately in order. my favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case. this is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages. this is the only reason i did not give it a one-star rating. i am currently looking for a soft case preferably a leather sleeve case that i can just pull my phone out of off of my hip rather than bother with a clip anymore. as a final warning - be careful if you buy this case. plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point ",negative
" let me count the ways this thing let me down: 1. you have to open it to slide out the full keyboard making it vulnerable to damage 2. it doesn't matter whether you open the case or not. if it drops the case falls right open anyway spilling your device on to whatever hard surface you were trying to protect the 8525 from. 3. the case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weight of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it. 4. the case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something and dropping everything on to the ground to be damaged (at least that's what happened to me). super disappointed in this product in case you couldn't tell ",negative

" after my nextel phone started acting up i decided to switch services because i liked the razr style and a lot of people i was calling were already on verizon so the in calling was a bonus. i have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my motorola i860. you can import only a couple of mp3s before the phones memory is full unless you buy their $50 transflash card (1 gig is the largest). then you cannot assign the mp3s you import as ringtones either a major disappointment for me - again missing my i860 with its 400+ ringtones that i imported from random wav midi and mp3 files. you cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events (you have to set a reminder for all there is no option for no reminder). all in all not what i grew accustomed to with my i860. i'm already thinking the $175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what i will spend over the life of my 2-year contract. and that leads me to another rip-off with verizon they charge you an extra $35 to sign only a one-year term! next time i'll read the fine print and just upgrade my nextel ",negative

" my problems with nextel did not stop when i canceled my service. i will get to the problems with the service. when i went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired i of course wanted to keep my number. so as i went to get my cingular phone (highly recommended) i had the old number switched to my new number. today i get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though i had not canceled my service but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. this was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. in my town not a small town by any means there are very few places that have any service. in the largest subdivision you cannot get service anywhere. i constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. most of the time i would not even recieve incoming calls calls would go straight to my voice mail. not only would i not get the calls but often i would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. when i did actually take calls (and call out) i cannot count the number of times i've had my call dropped. i recieved so many different error messages sometimes i wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. that brings me to the selling point of nextel the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. this is an absolute joke. direct connect only works maybe half the time i tried to use it. even then in the middle of the conversation i would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me i wont be talking to that person anymore. of course i would expect nothing less from the nextel network. text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. if it did not take hours to send or recieve a message it took days or maybe didn't even come at all. the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked. of course when you don't have service you don't get the internet access either. i was constantly getting the message network not available. calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. my experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and i write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. stick with verizon or cingular and you will be much happier in the end. don't make the same mistake i did.

" purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530 which i loved. i was at the end of a 2 year contract and felt that i would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons. two of my family members have higher end nextels and all work well. i would have purchased one of those except i didn't really care about a camera for my phone and this one was reasonably priced...and i found out you get what you pay for! the i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750 i870 and even my old i530. i had it for a couple of weeks when i started having trouble with the clarity of my calls - i could hear them but they couldn't hear me. a couple of times i had the screen go to airplane mode even when i hadn't touched it. the fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside too. my previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling but i had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it. not a great design for this holster. another problem is with the power supply. when charging the phone it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check that is says device attached - it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly. then i am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working. living in california apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee. fortunately we were on day 12 and after 54 minutes one accidental disconnection by nextel and 6 customer service agents i finally received a return authorization and placed a new order. terrible terrible phone. stay away from it. hoping the new one on it's way works much better! michell ",negative

" i've used the palm os going on 10 years now. when my treo 270 died i bought a used 270 on ebay. eventually that one died too and i bought an unlocked 650 on amazon. i called palm tech support on issues i had with it (dial up networking didn't work on internal browser with t-mobile). forgive me for saying it but the guy at palm support was as dumb as dumb can be. i got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another (he insisted that my treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser -even though i told him first hand that i used it all the time- did he think i was lying to him?). he knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time. after a few calls like this with no resolution i gave up and decided to return the 650. i then tried the t-mobile mda. i was uneasy of the idea of switching to windows pocketpc but decided to give it a try. for me it was a huge mistake- pocket pc is a joke and completely unintuitive. they expect you to study how to use their os in order to make use of its clumsy interface. friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use but c'mon- when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning- i don't want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly. finally i give up on pocket pc (sold it on ebay) and give palm another try when i see the 680 come out. the dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 (as compared to the 650) and i buy it unlocked directly from palm. overall it's a decent phone and i just feel way more comfortable with palm os over pocket pc. palm customer support is still useless and as others have mentioned the lack of a standard mini-usb connector is simply inexcusable. still i'm much happier with palm-os over pocket pc. as i use it i see that the battery doesn't seem to last very long (just over 2 hours of talktime at the most). i hesitantly call palm support and get some flunkie again- i decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their support. i'm just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged. i hate the idea of making such a compromise but for me it's the lesser of two evils. the fact that palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset. they just don't care. as clunky as my windows mda was its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the treo gives me (even though the mda has a much bigger screen). imho the smartphone market is still going through growing pains- the original handspring treo was designed by good people when palm bought them out they cashed in on the treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of handspring went right out the window -along with any intelligent design evolution of the treo. most of the better designed smartphones on the market (samsung motorola htc wizard) are all made for pocket pc because microsoft has used it's clout to take over the market. i just wish other manufacturers offered palm-os based smartphones again- this way you'd get the intuitive interface of palm without having to be limited to palm's poorly designed hardware. ....maybe it's time i finally give the blackberry a try.... : ",negative
" i love the way the phone looks and feels but that's about it. from finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone i've ever owned. i've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise. ",negative
" first let me say that i really wanted to like this device. i had patience and understanding for a while but it got me nowhere. the main issue with this phone is its operating system: windows mobile 5.0. this os is a piece of fluff garbage. simple things that should take a click or two have become so difficult to access that you basically just give up. main gripes ----------- connectivity with t-mobile is horrible: accessing the aim function doesn't work 9 times out of 10. e-mail functions are useless. i tried finding a solution for hours and the best i got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that. internet explorer can never find the page that i'm looking for and consistently tells me to try again. even when connected to wi-fi this happens. let me tell you also that this device does not let you choose between wi-fi and edge. if you already opened ie and you were using edge then it will continue to use edge unless you restart the phone with wi-fi enabled. calls ----- making a call was so difficult that i wanted to smash the phone on a daily basis. usually i would press talk to dial a call and it would immediately say call ended. it's as if the device doesn't even want to try. also when answering a call well trying to answer a call it would drop it as soon as i pressed talk. what the hell is that!? what good is a phone if you can't make or receive calls? keep in mind this happens around half the time. also keep in mind that i live in new york city! my calls should not be dropping except for when i'm in the subway. the side volume button is extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation. not only that but when you disable it you have no other method of changing the volume on the device. arggghhh! keyboard ------- while the keyboard is basically easy to type on the phone is buggy. first off the t9 sucks! it will completely change the word you are typing to a word that's in its dictionary while you're typing! extremely frustrating! now get this you can't even permanently keep the t9 off. so you have to keep going into the menu to change it to normal abc mode. while i appreciate the ability to have faster typing isn't the whole point of a qwerty being able to type without using t9? when you actually get to typing sometimes the keys will stick and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it. this isn't a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue. programs ------- for all you techno oriented people out there (basically everyone buying this phone) the programs this device has available for download are minuscule. not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a java program (which most programs are coded in) the dash's java program will not allow you to open those programs. i always get an error stating a java midlet is not responding it then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the app. neither of which solve anything. this phone is so useless it's beyond words. i could go on and on about it's issues but i really don't care to. stay away from this phone! while t-mobile customer support is very helpful and friendly their service/coverage is non-existent. calls are constantly dropped i get voice mails without the phone even ringing and internet connectivity is never really available. please do yourself a favor and wait for the iphone.

" in summary microsoft's software and t-mobile's service have ruined a brilliant design (although with a couple of flaws) from htc. there are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to. i will break it down to hardware software and cell phone service provider. hardware pro's: a lot has been written about this aspect of the device so i'll keep this to a minimum - the best form factor i've ever seen. this device provides you the power of a blackberry without the bulky hardware so i can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster. - a key selling point for me was the combined bluetooth wi-fi and quad-band connectivity that enabled me to connect a wireless headset cruise web pages and have access to email when in the us or europe. - the phone quality is excellent. - the keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for medium sized emails. - the battery life is great when wi-fi is not enabled and adequate when it is. (i've rarely struggled with a dying battery.) stand-by power management appears to be excellent. - charging of the device is very quick. - the display while a little small is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size. - the camera is pretty good and it's been really great emailing photo's to people as i'm traveling around. [after all of the cons that you'll read below you'll wonder why i ever bought the device and why i still use it. well here it is: 1. t-mobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device. 2. it has great hardware that i can use in the us and europe i'm just hoping that microsoft will finally get it right. ] hardware con's - the touch sensitive volume button is the most ill-conceived feature i've ever seen. even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level. even worse when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control and randomly change the volume. - the ti omap 850 at 201mhz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the device. however the blame could well be laid at microsoft's door for writing inefficient code and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications. either way performance is very slow for some basic functions (see below) and i'm afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor. software pro's - not many that really come to mind. software con's (i hope you're sitting comfortably) - when a call is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to take and which call to put on hold or drop/ignore. on the occasions this problem has occurred with me the call that is dropped/kept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed. the other call is dropped and not put on hold. - when a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped. this is extremely counter intuitive. if the user presses anything other than the answer key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when i have depressed the answer key. - the contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can be used. even worse upon selection the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open. now i have what some would call a large database of contacts but considering that the palm os version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash. it's simply a poorly architected database. - the user interface for entering a new contact is rudimentary (as are all dialog windows on this device.) - one of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock. the user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness. the digital watch i had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use model and was more thoroughly debugged. first of all the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off. from the interface you would assume you could only set a single alarm....if only it were that obvious. the best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example: i set the alarm for 6am; the next day the alarm goes off at 6am. that day i set the alarm for 7am - the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am. the next day i set the alarm for 7:30am and you guessed it the alarm now goes off three times. the best that i've been able to deduce (of course this type of behavior is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device) is that the user has to actively select off for the current setting before setting on for the new time. but there is no indication of what alarms are set so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of what's set and what isn't....the only way to clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard re-boot. - the calculator is a joke. if this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired. a calculator watch in the '80's had more sophisticated features. the user interface is so bad it's hard to describe it in words. - microsoft truly does not understand how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that they've inflicted upon us since windows 95. most features or function have to be navigated through the start menu button. applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections. some features are simply hard to find but should it really take so many menu selections to find common tools or applications? - the use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous - to put the device in silent mode but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up for example does not work. calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property. the only way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events....otherwise you get an alarm at midnight. - so on my nokia phone a thousand years ago when i went to europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency i needed once landed. the phone would then automatically connect to the provider available. it wasn't completely automatic but the user interaction was simple and intuitive. not with the dash. first of all t-mobile doesn't help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming. the feature is free so why not add a selection anyway? all you know when you get to your destination is that your phone won't connect to the local network no matter what you do. now assuming that you worked this out you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local provider's network. on my blackberry this was automatic but of course with microsoft there are selections to make searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice. assuming that you get connected at all. - activesync: this is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work. worse still when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization. it does not provide you with a fix a hint or a path so that you don't lose data. it does not even tell you the data that was lost. so i'm using a microsoft mobile os with microsoft xp and microsoft outlook and they can't get that right? (ok it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much microsoft but come on.) this was another primary purchasing driver for me. i am very busy and want to have my schedule up to date between my pc and pda - all the time. it's the only way to keep organized. i thought that with the same provider of all the software i'd be ok. also as this feature has been around for over a decade from palm and perfected by blackberry....how hard can it be? there are probably annoying nits that i have with the software but those are the major ones. and they are major. considering this is windows mobile 5.0 what on earth were they doing for 1.0 2.0 etc.? service provider pro - t-mobile is useful to me for traveling in europe. they have much better coverage over there than in the us (where i'm actually paying). - their package is competitive. service provider con: - coverage is not good enough. i'm in san francisco and i have dead spots in my house. - their back-end connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy. at random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you must have something wrong with your connection and emails can't be accessed. but you know there's nothing wrong with your connection because you've been on the browser. also there was a whole day that emails were not accessible. because of the many issues that i'd had with email set up and maintaining a connection i went through various debug routines wondering what had failed. when i finally called technical support they told me that their service was down - no apology no notification no nothing. certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenience. (so why didn't i call technical support earlier? read below...) - their technical support structure is terrible. i have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their help line. i'm not going to go into details as it would just take too long. bottom line if you have a problem with your phone say dash at the prompt and then ask for tier three data support. everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians you'll encounter have inadequate training. if you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial - do not do it - this cycles you back around to tier two data support and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device. so should you buy it? wait until windows mobile 6.0 comes out at least. maybe another provider will pick up the device by that time. then see what else is available ",negative
" my phone broke after a month or so. after spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted to blame me (did you put it in fluorescent light did you put it in the sun did you drop it did you put it in your pocket and bend it did you put it in your pocket and bump into something did you drop it did you break it did you do something bad to it) they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money. the most amusing part of the conversation went like this: would you like ups ground which will take 10 days or ups 3 day which will cost $15? when i responded that the ground would be fine she said ok that will be $9.95. i had to laugh at their arrogance.

" after reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone i purchased. here are the main issues i have found with this phone: 1) the buttons are too small particularly the main control button. you have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. and believe me i do not have very large hands. 2) if you have quite a few contacts in your phone you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact. you will notice that if you are not careful you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly so if this is you be aware. 3) you must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message. very inconvenient!! there is no indication to show this on the top screen only the inside screen. 4) on occasion the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely. what you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again. not optimal and i probably just got a bad phone but i am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent so i can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from motorola. note: i have no personal vendetta against motorola but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff i bought into before purchasing ",negative

" the phone is great .. and i knew it would be. and i am a devoted amazon shopper. my concern was always whether amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans ... a concern that has proved well founded. i was originally concerned because of feedback i had read on this site indicating the pearl shipped hot with an active sim which meant for those that -- like me - were upgrading (vs. new service) their existing phone would stop working while the new phone was en route. to be fair that did not happen; however i received the pearl with a sim card that the phone would not accept. the instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the sim turn on the phone and it will work. and if it doesn't work it says don't call cingular call amazon. i followed the instructions -- phone didn't work i called amazon at which point the csr told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 hours!!! unfortunately i let the poor guy have it ... i told him what i truly believe which is that it is completely unacceptable to tell me i have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone - which is supposed to work out of the box -- isn't working. so - 5 stars for the phone itself ... awesome! 2 stars for amazon ... they do not have the kinks worked out yet. on a positive note -- i immediately called cingular and they resolved the problem for me on the spot (sim was not activated / in the system) ",negative

" this review is more about virgin mobil customer service than the phone. i ordered a vox 8610 on 1/22/2007 online thru virgin mobile. the phone wouldn't charge. i called customer service and explained the problem. they said did i want a charger or another phone. i replied that i could not tell if it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please send a new kit. i received a phone but not a charger and it also wouldn't charge. i called customer service and explained the issue and it must be the charger at fault. the rep said they would not send a new charger that i would have to purchase one. i said this didn't make any sense according to the offer i could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean that to get a new phone and charge i need to return the phones for a refund and then order another one to get a charger? the support rep said yes and that i had to make up my mind - either return the phone or purchase a charger. i asked to speak to a supervisor. the customer support rep kept going off line (to talk to someone?) but refused or couldn't get a supervisor to talk to me. she then asked for the esn number of the phone. when i said i didn't know what an 'esn' number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on the back of the phone. i'm not clear why she needed this since i haven't activated the phone and i already referenced the order (vmu) number. at any rate i had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep (obviously not very cost effective for virgin mobile) and at least she was trying to track down some info - or so i thought - she finally came back on line and said that the computer was down and she couldn't handle my order - that i would have to call back. i called back had to work my way thru the answering system and got thru to rma and a fellow named mike. mike explained that they couldn't send a charger (none in stock) and that i would have to send the entire phone back - which is what i am now doing - 60+ minutes after the initial call. i have to say that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive. they customer service staff is obviously poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions. the interfaces with support are youth geared - not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally. i am sending the phone back for a refund and re-considering the provider for pay-as-you-go service. 01/26/2007.

" i have had this phone for about six months. i replaced a kyocera that i disliked because it was so big but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems. the menus are very poorly designed they are difficult to navigate and it's hard to do anything. the ringer speaker is inside the phone so when it's closed it's almost impossible to hear. i almost never hear it ring. i usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on! i hate this phone and will be replacing it soon.

" i reluctantly bought this phone because my kyocera slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after vm's warranty was up and i had just purchased a $20 phone card + had airtime credits which were not refundable. now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment.my kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches what-so-ever so i was pretty upset.after multiple calls and 2 emails to vm it was pretty clear they weren't going to do anything to help. i was offered a replacement slider at $20.obviously i didn't want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couple of months so like i was saying i had no other recourse but to purchase this audiovox 8610.by the way after i purchased the phone at a local store in town (when i called to activate the phone)they have the nerve to tell me that i could've purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of $24.99 because the slider died.the f!@%ng idiots!hello could ya not have told me sooner???and after i spent $50 + tax.sheesh! anyway back to the phone review..the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here.its so low that if its in my purse i can't even hear it! wtf??? also the battery life sucks no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half.it also doesnt get good service with the vm/sprint network my slider had xcellent service w/it despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls. so i've had it 5 days and i'm considering attempting to bring it back where i purchased it from.however i don't want to buy an expensive phone from vm because i'm seriously reconsidering continuing w/them. the way i see it vm leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell + they are expensive.i am a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet- wise.prior to these issues i was a happy vm customer but not anymore.

" i've had this thing for two weeks. coming from the blackberry 8700c this phone is a big disappointment. work issued this and took away the blackberry and i'm stuck with it. all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goes. the more i use the thing the less i like it. here's my list good and bad. * battery life - attrocious. use the extended battery throw away the standard one. trust me. grade: d. * navigation - cumbersome. the keys are too small the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally. workable if you don't have huge hands. grade: b * windows mobile - i hate it. why do applications not quit when you end them? instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager. the menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from cingular how convenient. grade: c+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys. * java is broken google email doesn't work. maps does work with the new version thankfully. grade: c. * no standard headphone jack. hello?? this is suppose to be an mp3 player right? somebody explain to me why this is ok. grade: f. * phone quality - grade a. yes they did something right. the phone works great reception is great speakerphone is great. bluetooth is great. * outlook & email - this is workable but difficult. you can write an email you can edit your schedule and tasks but it's not easy. if blackberry gets and a (and it does) blackjack gets a c. it doesn't synch notes so if you're an outlook notes person you're just left out sorry. why?? * hardware quality - very good b+. the thing really feels solidly built. the screen is vibrant and attractive. the camera seems to work fine although i may use it twice per year. in short if you really want to get work done on your phone get a blackberry. if you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice this could be the one for you.

" after owning 3 blackberry's over the years i made the switch to the blackjack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. compared to the blackberry the microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. on the plus side the blackjack has good battery life the screen is excellent and it has the best reception i've ever experienced. the reason i only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. it's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable especially when it's backlit. i called cingular first who passed me on the samsung where after 2 hours on the phone i was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. to my surprise they went on to say that at their discretion they might also charge me for the repair. i've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and i always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that i've encountered this i do feel it's worth considering. if you're thinking about a blackjack i encourage you to be aware that for one the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys and that you may well be on your own when it comes to service. i feel that it's reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right.

" i bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and it's nice to have one charging while i'm using the other--you don't have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone. so i also bought one of boxwave's batteries for the 8525. well the spare battery charger will charge the boxwave battery just fine but it refuses to charge the battery that came with my 8525. this really limits its usability as an off-line charging device. the cradle itself plugs into the usb port on the phone which was not designed with cradling in mind so it's not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle. since the camera button is on the bottom of the phone (who's idea was that anyway?) it almost always gets pressed while i'm wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle. this is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station. anyway just my opinion but it's actually easier to connect the standard usb charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle so i'd recommend save your money and just sticking with the standard usb charger. if you really want to do all charging off-line you may need to buy two boxwave batteries instead of just one ",negative

" i have owned palm organizers since the days of the original palm pilot and have loved them (i think i had three different models over the years). i wanted a smart phone so i could check my email so i gravitated to the treo 680 so i could stay with a palm product and so i could stay with my current mobile provider cingular. now i am counting the days until my 2 year commitment ends so i can punt this awful awful product. i may even bite the bullet and pay off my commitment early just so i can get rid of it. the battery problem is huge. you must remember to stick this in a charger whenever you can. if you forget and leave it in your pocket overnight then it will be dead the next day. i have turned off every thing i can find that sucks power and it still drains amazingly fast. it won't even last a day if you make very many calls. the reception is terrible. i've had a cingular phone for a long time and was able to get good reception over most of so. california (except for my house of course). with this phone i think you have to be right underneath an antenna to get a signal. i was on a conference call yesterday and got dropped twice. i am envious everytime i get in an elevator with someone who can talk on their cell phone because mine will freeze up any time i try that. yes it freezes up often. the only way i have found to unfreeze it is to take out the battery and let it do a hard reboot. the versa mail program that it came with from cingular is hard to work with. you must leave your work computer on to check the corporate mail. that means if i am traveling with my computer the phone's corporate mail program will not work. it often will not sync anyway. i don't think the browser that comes with the phone will work with java so i cannot check my yahoo mail either. i tried going back and forth to the pre-java version of yahoo and that is too much of a pain. i get all kinds of weird messages with the phone. i haven't ever been able to sync up the palm features because of some legacy files from my previus palm software something that never happened when i upgraded before. yes there is a manual that is huge. it is hard to use on line so i guess i need to bite the bullet and print out the whole thing and then take a week of vacation to read it and see if i can make any of these neat functions that i read about work. hardly a week goes by that i don't actively think how much i hate this phone. i actually signed on to amazon today just to write this because the phone wasn't working properly today. what a piece of junk!

" i helped develop the danger hiptop (aka t-mobile sidekick) and hated holding its brick-like nature to my head ... i wanted a good headset ... the only problem is i *hate* earbuds so i wasn't looking forward to shopping for/buying one. i went to the local super-electronics store and abusing their return policy bought one of every headset they had to try -- 23 headsets to be exact ... i picked up the jabra only to be a complete-ist figuring there was no way i'd buy its star-trek-bugs-crawling-in-chekov's-ear styling. but after trying them all the jabra was *easily* the best feeling and best fitting. in a nutshell here are the things i like about this unit in particular: * it comes with 6 different fittings (3 sizes for the right and the left) so you get a chance to get a *much* closer fit than some generic ear piece. * contrary to what others have said here the ear pieces stay *very* snug in your ear (if they don't you're not fitting them correctly). * i wear glasses so i can't tolerate over-the-ear headsets. this of course is great in that way. * i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic ear-only jabra because it: 1. let's people know you're talking on the phone and less likely to interrupt you while you're talking. 2. i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise. * it's small and easy to wrap up into my cell case. also in the newest version they've adding a securing lip to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece (this definitely was a problem before). to top it all off jabra's support is excellent. i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me *three* replacements free of charge along with a ball point pen for my troubles. at 10 bucks these things are a steal ... using one with my hiptop is a joy -- it means i can still contruct sms's type in emails add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone. if you have a data device of any kind this will make your phone experience twice as good. a truly great product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right. what more could you want? thanks for reading ",positive
" i think this is a pretty good earpiece... granted i've only used one other (it was a flimsy little thing that came w/ my friend's nokia) but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort. where my friend's would fall out of my ear this one (once i got it figured out) never comes loose. second listening to people on my friend's i would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted; but on my jabra i can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear-- moreso than when i'm not using the earpiece. finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled; i've had no complaints from the people i'm talking to using the jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when i use the earboom than when i don't. the ear gels are a bit hard to get used to. they are oddly shaped (as you can see in the picture) and there are six of them total-- three of them for each ear. lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces they've used and that they fit perfectly... i can honesly say i've had both experiences. when i first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that i would turn my head: *very* frustrating. i tried pushing it into my ear as hard as i could i tried holding it in place with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a hands-free earpiece. nothing seemed to work. i was thinking of returning it. i was thinking of throwing it into traffic on i-95. and then one day somehow i came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear-- with the little poky-out part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal (not the fold on the top of your ear; if you do that it'll just pop out again)-- and then *voila* it stays put. matter o' fact it'll stay put so well that it'll be a little bit difficult-- even *painful*-- to get out again. i can imagine that people with different ear sizes different patience levels and lower iqs might have different experiences than my own. but all i can say is that once i had this little bugger figured out i was golden. i love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it. admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear-- i'd say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly (before you're good and practiced at it) which may not sound like a lot but it's long enough to not recognize somebody's voice or hear the first sentence they say or whatever. a *very mild* frustration. but like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now i have it so that i can answer the phone slip the earboom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat. in fact i find this earpiece to be so comfortable that i forget that it's in until i go to scratch my ear or something! the other complaint that i saw on here was that it's not compatible with nokia phones. in fact it even says right on the package that it's not compatible with nokia. that's funny i have a nokia 3589i and it works just fine. they make two other models of earboom (one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone) both of which claim to be nokia compatible and *neither* of those works with my phone! confusing? yes! the problem is it doesn't work with *all* nokia phones. while browsing at the store i noticed that the ones that claimed to be nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didn't include mine (it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my model: the 3590); which piqued my curiosity. and so i went to the friendly manager of the store that i was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them. one of them worked the other didn't. the strange part of it was that we couldn't see a visible difference in the two units... and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it (that's this one and if you look closely at the picture you can see them) while the other one (the one marked as nokia compatible) had three. hmmm... curious. so my advice is to either know your phone well (as in have the little book handy) or ask for help before purchasing. all in all 4 of 5 stars. i'd give it 5 stars on performance and comfort but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging. addendum: several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end... and living in windy providence this is a bit of an annoyance. also for a while i was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that i couldn't hear the person on the other end of the line (and likewise they couldn't hear me) unless i jiggled the little jack. this was *very *frustrating.** now for some reason i'm not having that problem anymore. i'm not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the earboom. either way it's something buyers should be aware of ",positive

" i love these eargels. my ears are a funny shape and i can't wear regular earbuds but when i add these gels they fit great and don't fall out. they block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds. sometimes i need a small and sometimes i need a medium depending on the day the weather and how long i use them. (i gave the large size to my boss and he loves them too so don't say you can't use all of the sizes guys. ",positive
" i agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. here's an idea to do a public exchange. i do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage. i just need the small sizes. ",positive
" i recently got this phone and love it. t-mobile's service may not be the best but i have had no problems with the phone itself. for all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-it is. the pink razr offered by cingular is a pale pink the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown. i looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades ",positive
" having had every new gadget imaginable i must report that i love this phone because i can take pictures and make videos! i loathe having to charge the battery everyday! perhaps i just got a bad battery but i've never had to charge any phone daily. keep in mind that i leave my phone on 24/7. maybe i should turn it off. does anyone else have this same syndrome? if you're a shutterbug like me you will love this phone. i didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love. one note of caution if you live in hurricane alley like me you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. it may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage ",positive
" i have a t-mobile magenta razr and have for the past 6 months. i love it. in fact when i had issues with my first one t-mobile replaced it. they have great customer service! this phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. and i love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. they should make more phones in fun bright colors like this. i personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. of course i will admit that i liked the motorola software so much with my first phone that i stuck with the brand for this phone. it is so easy i figured it out without really picking up the manual. overally i will continue to stick w/t-mobile and motorola for as long as i keep needing a cellphone ",positive
" i purchased the pink razr with cingular service and couldn't be happier. i have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all. i am very happy with it. t-mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why i chose cingular ",positive
" love it. sort of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel. some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but it's still red which is nice. i will probably get another color on it for spring. the fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where i got my razr since the sprint red is a little different. also maintains all openings for data cables etc ",positive
" absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m. fits perfectly. ",positive
" i have had this for almost 6 months and i like it a lot. right off it looks great. black leather blue piping going around the edge. the blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have: neons or tetras? whichever it is it is very sharp looking. i keep i860 cell phone in the 'glove all the time. it does not add much bulk/size/weight to the phone. it fits it after all like a glove. when i am taking a photo i simply unsnap the half that is on the flip-up half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is take the photo and slip it back on. before i used to know about this i used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way like a wayward lock of hair. turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary. they designed it so you can just remove that half of the case take photo(s) and snap it back on. smart. in fact the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half. look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it guys. it's a snap! snaps unsnap; that is what they are for. the glove is well named. it makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand. i can easily pivot it around in my hand flip it around pick it up and basically not expect it to skid around. without the 'glove you have a bare metal or plastic case. smooth looking and - well maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars! i like the fast release for the belt hook. so far it has not failed me. i think it is at the bottom not at the back the way some people have said but i cannot remember for certain. i know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet. i don't use it that way much though. the i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s. i easily fit it in my pocket. with the glove on i know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily ",positive
" this protects my ppc 6700 wonderfully... i've dropped it many times and this case protected it like i wanted... no scratches nothing... having room for the extended battery is great too because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone ",positive
" was received in a timely manner however the picture online was not what i expected. for the price i really thought it was a little cheap looking in person. as it was a gift i was somewhat disappointed in the quality. however the person i gave it to was pleased ",positive
" this headseat is pretty neat when you're on the road or just relaxing between work. it easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a call and also controls the pause/play and answer/hangup features. the comfort of the ear budds could be a little better but the stereo sound is great ",positive
" fast service good price. look forward to future business dealings. ",positive
" this is a great product. the only area of improvement would be the belt clip. it is very difficult to attach to the belt. over all it is a great case ",positive
" i really like this phone the camera quality the software everything is excellent ",positive
" this is really cool phone and has many features. unfortunately you could not use some of these features in the u.s. one thing i do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the us and retailers charge much more price. its price is just 429.99 on the nokia's web page. the phone gets 5 stars but the retailer's price gets -2 stars.

" i will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone i have ever owned.its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear ",positive
" just received it this week. replacing my nokia n90 with this model the photos are much better (both have optical carl zeiss lenses but this is 3.2 mp vs. 2.0 on the n90). also the n73 covers all radio bands making the reception on my cingular coverage very very strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae). the n90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by cingular so depending on the city i was in i occasionally had very spotty coverage. the symbian operating system in the n73 is faster than the older version on the n90 and best of all it is much more compact than the n90 fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket. last there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone protecting the camera lense (why aren't they all like this?). as usual the flash isn't the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera but otherwise i see this phone as the best of both worlds. ",positive
" if you don't use this phone it costs $3/month. normal hours til 9 p.m. it's 12 cents per minute which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost. perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when i'm in transit and feel that i simply must know where they are and what they are doing. i don't use cell phones much but if i must have one i might as well have one that doesn't make me worry about another huge bill. for kids who think they can mangle the budget forget it cuz when the card is used up -- that's it kiddo. once they use up the card the only number they can dial is 911 but that's it. bonus features: clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day. at some point i might not be able to live without this. ",positive
" these javoscreen treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen. typically 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen hope against hope that you don't have bubbles but you almost always do. when the screen is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible..... but these javoscreen protectors are a completely different animal. they are thick and tough and relatively firm. and because of those properties they go on with no bubbles and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time. further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good. this is the state of the art for screen protectors. and this all becomes an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over time the screen will get dulled and scratched. because of the thickness and quality of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.

" i was completely satisfied with the phone clip i purchased. it`s sturdy and well constructed. i would recommend it.i will use this site again ",positive
" i have had this motorola v171 for a year now and i absolutely love it. the features are so easy to understand. the customer service reps for net 10 wireless are very hard to understand. this phone is a net 10 wireless phone. net 10 wireless is a subsidiary of tracfone. i would this phone to anybody looking for a prepaid cell phone plan. i love it because only for a limited time you get 300 minutes free upon activation of your phone. i would also strongly recommend that if anybody purchases this motorola activate it on [...] its a whole lot easier than calling ",positive
" i've been using this phone with the net10 service since march and have to say i am very happy with it. coverage areas have been great. i don't use a cell phone very often so this was the most economical way for me to go. although the phone doesn't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have....it gets the job done ",positive
" i have not had any problems with this phone.i dont use it for long periods at a time ...only in the car and for text.adding minutes is easy and i really get my moneys worth with the rollover.i averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare...so its great for me.i got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper.overalli would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week ",positive
" i like this little flip phone. the service has been good and the features are easy to use. the only reason i give 4 stars is because i am not sure how long the phone will last. the flip part is a little weak but we will have to see. it was really easy to add minutes and you can do it right from your net10 phone ",positive
" the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be. it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i couldn't be happier. i am going to buy another in a different color ",positive
" this is a great skin for a treo 700. i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that. as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases etc). but the thickness gains you considerable protection. i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch. i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type. the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press. ",positive
" the protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (gps car holder) but does do what is was designed to do. solid grip and non-slip. would be nice if it was not so thick ",positive
" i use this all of the time. it gives good protection ease of use and good handling. only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock. however this is true of any protective skin. outstanding product. ",positive
" overall i'm happy with the skin. it fits the treo 700 very closely. this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo. my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. the 700w and p if you don't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes. well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p. not a huge deal just a slight annoyance. i'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow ",positive
" after buying the new lg chocolate i found that i needed to buy a new car charger for it. i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value. so far it's worked just like it should ",positive
" when i first got this it did not look like it was big enough for my phone but as soon as i opened the package and put my phone in it i could tell it was a perfect fit. i really like the clear window which i did not have on my previous case now i can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time ",positive
" this is the best bluetooth i have used. wind noice no problem user friendly coustomer support for cardo is great . i have 5 co worker who has order the headset. just a great product. great pric ",positive
" my only complaint and consequently the 4-star rating is that sometimes i don't hear the blackberry or feel the vibration. apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the oem plastic holster ",positive
" this is a great way to carry the blackberry. it also keeps it protected. i would recommend this product ",positive
" provides great protection for the treo but does add a noticeable amount of thickness making it more of a bundle ",positive
" overall i like it. the best part is the flip up screen protector. i have had 2 zire models and managed to break both screens. my dislike is that i have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting. i have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again to no avail. as for the sd card issue i remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject. to keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo i drilled a hole in the back right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes ",positive
" the skin is very useful but can be improved on ways to put it on and take it off ",positive
" i'm not really a gadget guy and what gadgets i do have get pretty beat up. when the company gave me a treo 650 so i can stay in touch i needed to at least take care of the thing. so i bought this skin from speck products. its is absolutely awesome! no more dings or scratches. i'm a minimalist and for that the treo 650 skin is perfect! a cool look not bulky. easy access to the buttons. they did their homework on this product. a must have for anyone who owns a treo 650. i also see they have these for the blackberries ",positive
" iam very pleased with this item i purchased it for my son ",positive
" i made the mistake of ordering a $7.00 battery and i thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting. i replaced my new battery with this new battery and now it works like a champ. so word to the wise... just get this battery and you will not have my problems. well worth it ",positive
" this item works perfectly with my samsung blackjack. the sound quality is exceptional. the only problem is that the clip to attach to your shirt tends to fall off ",positive
" when i bought my motorola v220 my cingular store charged top dollar for the car charger - and they were sold out. i was thrilled when i found this starter set on amazon. the car charger is compatible with the v220 and it comes with case and hands-free ear bud - all for less than i would have paid for the charger alone. the ear bud does not have the best sound - voices come across as somewhat muffled though still audible - and the case is adequate. i wouldn't buy this set specifically for those items although they both work with/fit the v220. as i see it they were bonuses for purchasing the charger. five stars for the charger three for the rest ",positive
" this item was easy to find purchase and use. saved us several dollars as well. a true win-win. thanks ",positive
" the product is compact and convenient but it feels flimsy. the hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after i did a hard reset of my palm tx--so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my tx. for some reason the cable won't let me charge using the usb wall-charger i got for my wife's ipod but it does charge the tx off my computer's usb port (which is a powerbook g4--notorious for being underpowered) ",positive
" great reception great volume controls easy to use... i have the blue my husband the black... to the reviewer who said too thin - well don't get the thin phone then... works great with his blue tooth and my jabra (plug in) - even comes with the adaptor for plug in phones... which other phone would most likely make you buy. we're in our late 20s/early 30s - and just dig the phone. fits perfect in a small purse or wallet. one issue dh has -- the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into (bottom of the phone) and when he is on speaker phone he tends to hold it there and it sometimes can make your bars go down. that is it and all you have to do is readjust the way you hold the phone ",positive
" i really like this phone.. its cute its little its perfect for a young woman. i had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call. i wanted something simple that wasn't an mp3 player (i have an ipod) that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam) or a pda (i have a palm tx)... its just simple and cute. its bluetooth compatible... although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth but i'm not sure if its the headset or the phone.. **the ringer on it is super quiet... almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse. i'm grown accustomed to listening for the vibrate feature instead. i like how you can put a person's picture next to their name in your contact list. i can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable. sound quality is good on both ends i dig it. im sure you will too ",positive
" i have trouble to buy from bestbuy but i ordered it from amazon cheapest price and good product! thanks ",positive
" the item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from scratches it fits like a glove really nice the delivery from eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked after 5 days of use it wasn't hit or treated carelessly. i'll order some more because they are really cheap and it's better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone.love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days i had to dump it. ",positive
" got this to protect my motorola l6 phone. it fits the phone like a glove. i also love that it protects the phone screen. the only complaint is that the case open easily if it's dropped or handled in a rough way. clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that. my toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it. the case still does not have a chip or crack on it ",positive
" a perfect fit for my l6. i love the protection for the screen....it covers all of it so you don't need those plastic screen covers. don't be afraid if you drop your phone... because it's protected ",positive
" i have been buying these chargers from sprint and they last about six-twelve months. i bought this one and it is much more solid of construction shorter cord and a better angle to the power adapter. i bought two of these for less than the cost of one from sprint. my wife carries her's in her purse while i just keep mine in my car. this is the best car charger for the treo and i have had treo's for about 6 years ",positive
" fits the cell phone well and seems secure. i like the catch that holds it on the belt to keep it from slipping off the belt when sitting dow ",positive
" i recommend this phone to anybody. i absolutely love it. i have had it for three months now and not a problem so far. the music player is great and i swear...the camera looks alot better than 1.3 mega pixel. the handset is wonderful and so is the headset included with it. if you buy this phone it will last you a long time. but yeah..so far no problems whatsoever. i love it. [.. ",positive
" i am in love...with my phone! i know that sounds absurd but it's true. originally i had suggested a friend to upgrade their handset to getting this one; seeing how i had already done so with the motorola v3t. ironically after being displeased with 2 different motorola's v3t razr handsets (both for having them freeze at startup) i called customer service and told 'em i wanted this handset instead. with a minor contract extension/handset upgrade i was glad i made the switch to nokia. i've only had it for 24 hours and i'm totally satisfied with it. below is a list of pro's and con's for you to consider: pros: - bright and visible lcd screen. - mp3-ringtones enabled (make sure to cut your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing so). - video ringers. - pretty fast charge even while messing around with it. - bluetooth and infrared-enabled making for quick file transfers. - dialing keypad is raised for easy input. - date can be enabled on screen (which the v3t lacks). - comes with headphone jack adapter which enables use of any standard headphone that you may have. cons: - vibrate functionality is disabled with handset charges (by default). - power button is somewhat small and difficult to execute. - fm radio plays with static (this may varies by area). as you can see the pro's outweight the con's with this one so give it at try. also if you decide that it's not for you return it to t-mobile within 14 business days of your purchase and get a full refund. as for me i won't returning it because it's definitely a keeper! : ",positive
" i purchased this phone to replace my land line and have not been disappointed. i haven't used all the functions yet (downloading music) but haven't had any problems with anything else. here are some pros and cons: pros 1-colorful/clear display 2-good volume (ringer volume is loud enough and i can hear callers just fine) 3-easy menu navigation cons 1-no shortcut to get to main menu (have to keep pressing back button) 2-battery access (it's really hard to take the casing off to get to the battery and sim card-could be a good thing though) 3-on/off button (it's very small-basically have to use my fingernail) ",positive
" i got a chance to play with one of these last week. the external speaker is very loud the controls are easy to use and best of all it comes with a 1gb card. my only gripe is the slide feels a little loose; i felt like i was always going to open it up by mistake. all in all a killer phone and the mp3 capability/software is a lot better than my krzr ",positive
" i purchased this nokia 5300 black at the t-mobile store. it does come with 1 gb memory card and i was able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems. phone comes with usb cable to connect to your computer. i have a mac so this was easy to do. you will not be able to download songs bought from itunes but you can load up aac files and mp3 and mp4. you can hold up to 500 songs if they are all 3.5 minutes long and compressed to 128 kps. my music is usually remixed and/or longer than 3.5 minutes each. i wasn't able to sync up with bluetooth to my ibook but i was able to pair with my motorola t305 that i will be using in my car. apple has not approved the nokia 5300 yet to sync. i am sure it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new. overall i love the feel of this phone has wonderful 2 in screen color is great camera is cool and it is very intuitive to use. i have been with samsung over the last three years and i was concerned about going back to a nokia. however the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the motorola 195 that i originally got but returned. once you load up your songs the speaker is impressive. this morning i had the phone playing music in one part of the house and i had to go get something at the other end of the house and i could still hear the music perfectly. calling on the phone was better than expected. i was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of people/background noise and i was able to carry on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my samsung that was difficult to do this with. the phone is quite sturdy. and i am happy to have a phone that not everyone has - a motorola razor. this nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone but i feel like i have a very unique phone that is more than a phone. who needs an ipod mini when you can get this and your phone all in one? i just ordered the boxwave frost case for this phone. there is very little to chose from at the t-mobile store as far as accessories and nokia.com didn't have much either. ***** the alarm feature to wake up is cool too. you can choose to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of the song for your alarm. it also comes with programmable snooze. what a dream! ***** you can make calls without even having to slide the phone to dial. as long as you have the number you want already stored in your phone book then all you have to do is look up and press the green button! ***** when you are playing your music if an incoming call comes in it will stop playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in. once you are done with the phone call you can resume playing your music. ***** as i said this phone is a gem in all areas - speaker sturdy colorful i think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing call quality is great even in loud areas and lots of little creature comforts. definitely consider this phone if you really like to have music and bluetooth and speakerphone. else this may not be the phone for you ",positive
" i just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part. the first thing you'll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is. this is a slider phone and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys. the only things that i can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number that's not in your contacts and to text message. next we go to the features. so we got a 1.3mp camera camcorder music player 1gb microsd card bluetooth support and infrared port..and *drumroll please* an fm radio. now the fm radio isn't satellite based so you cannot pick up radio stations from across the u.s. just those stations local to you. now i will go into the good and bad things about each feature: 1. camera - impressive picture quality. yes it's only 1.3mp compared to those 8mp digital cameras but can you show me a camera that does what this phone does? 5/5 2. camcorder - not all that impressive. while you are recording the quality seems perfect. however once you play it it turns a bit distorted. plus it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microsd card. 3/5 3. music player - impressive. the speaker is of good quality and very loud. however i still could not find a way to change the order of the songs without making a playlist. there's play pause next song previous song fast forward and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures. the buttons must be pressed fairly hard so your music won't start playing spontaneously in your pocket. also i was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once you put on those stock earbuds. 4/5 4. fm radio - i bet those that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement. well the truth is you don't need to buy anything extra. just plug in the earbuds that came with the phone and this will serve as an 'antenna' and will allow you to hear stations. and since you need the earbuds to hear the radio yes the sound will go to the earbuds. however there's a 'loudspeaker' option that allows the radio to be played through the external speaker but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in as it serves as the 'antenna'. this means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone you need to have the earbuds with you. you may need to play around with the position of the phone and antenna (or you may have to move) in order to get clear reception. 3/5 misc. info: only two games to included and both trials. (lumines texas hold'em) you can't transfer games from another phone. you must pay and download them again. you can't delete the pre-created profiles (those that come with the phone). you can just create your own. in order to change the phone to vibrate you must make a vibrating profile. then to use it it takes several steps which is not hard but inconvenient. the interface shows the month and date but not the day of the week. only two face templates included with the phone. that's all for now. overall: 4/ ",positive

" i had a motorola h300 before... and this is leaps and bounds better. the sound quality in both units are great but i'm impressed by the weight of this lg unit. it is like comparing stones to feathers (a bit exagerated but you get the point...). this lg unit also has a protruding ear bud which sits snuggly in my ear. the motorola unit didn't... which often dangled and swayed like the last apple on a tree right before it falls. that caused discomfort and i had to tilt my head a bit to keep the unit against my ear. with the new lg i no longer have to look like i have a stiff neck while i'm driving ",positive

" this product is a good deal if you know how to use it. unfortunately if you are purchasing this product to add music to your phone you may want to reconsider. the verizon v=cast product would be better because it comes with headphones. if you already have the headphones (which cost anywhere from $20-$100) than this product will be good for you ",positive
" it fits great but doesn't cover the corners of the phone... kinda the point of a case. the seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful. the bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip you're stuck with it sticking out in your pocket.

" i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync (an idiot design if you ask me) and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires. and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an extra $30-40! so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing. the reason why it got only 4 stars is b/c when i first tried it my computer said that it didn't recognize the usb device. i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why. it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more. so the connector part could be a little sturdier that's all ",positive
" use it every day it's a nice connector that does just what it says it does. as with all treo/palm connectors you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection. wiggling the connector where it meets the treo is usually enough for it to work for me ",positive

" this holster holds the v220 securely in place. the only problem might be that it is hard to pull it out of the holster without flipping it open and thus answering the phone. ",positive
" this is a good holster for my v220. it doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did. for a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt. one problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well. and also because it holds it where the strap is it adds a little wear to that area. other than that its a good holster for the price. and thats another one of my problems. i paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall which was highly over priced for my standards. amazon seems like a great place to buy it but if you search for motorola v220 phone accessories then you can find a site with free shipping for it and its 7 bucks. theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks but with shipping. i trust amazons shipping though. so if you want a functional holster get this one ",positive
" i have had this phone (and virgin mobile pay as you go service) for only a day or two but i wanted to write this review before i forget. i'll update it if i change my mind. once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in it's a good ride. the phone resembles a small remote control. it's sleek and unassuming. turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on the color screen but it's a pleasant experience. the sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation. it's attractive. it works. it seems a real no-brainer given the other choices for the virgin mobile service. you can have fun with it or just ignore the fun stuff--but you'll have to get used to the funny graphics. the ui is totally intuitive. you interact with the menus on the screen and the few keys below it as if you've been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences. one thing: this whole service and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine (thirties). while it's a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing (pay as you go--for me 18c/min) there's a ton of stuff to play with if your train gets stuck in a tunnel. i have lily tomlin's operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds; and if i should ever receive a text message among my canned response options (that come standard with the phone) are hell no can't talk and leave me alone. my friend has had one for a few months and loves his. he makes a good bit more money than i and sports some fancy handheld devices so it's not just that it's so cheap and cool. ",positive
" i'm a long-running virgin customer but additionally i work as a developer in the mobile industry and so i've had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier (including non-us). previous virgin phones i've used include the vox 8610 and kyocera 2255. my 8610 still works but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and i decided to upgrade. let's start with the positives: -very compact design. this is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. it is so thin that when i put it in the same pocket as my wallet i sometimes forget it's there. -for the cost it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support 10 mb for downloads (32 total) speakerphone web capability comparable performance to most nokia series 40 devices. very long battery life and fast charging. for those that have had trouble with the battery i suggest you try turning off the backlight. it might have... interesting... effects. -uses the sprint network. i've found this to be very reliable in my area and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors. -call quality is good. comparable to the 8610 as far as i can tell which was also good (my old kyocera on the other hand was garbage). -ui has a solid standard design. predictive text included for messaging. the phone's graphics are a bit odd but not necessarily in a bad ways. -durable. utstarcom knows how to build to last. this handset is no exception. -good library of games ringtones and graphics available. now i actually have something to spend all that balance on... -virgin is a very low cost provider. it's no good if you want video on demand 3g or whatnot. but for just making calls/texting now and then you simply can't beat $20/3 months. no annual contract as well which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well). on the downside: -keys are a bit small. this is typical of ultra-thin handsets. they are a bit stiff as well which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily bad because typing is more of a pain). -virgin's web browser is lame. their web service costs extra and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). you can browse basic html and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it. -no bluetooth built-in though this is to be expected. -no camera either also to be expected. this can actually be a good thing since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect. bottom line: this handset is great for the price. there are flaws with it as with any phone but the pluses outweigh the minuses. i've seen many reviewers complain about both virgin and the phone but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. this isn't a $200 samsung t519 and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. considering the costs the slice is an great handset with excellent service and that is that ",positive
" i've been a virgin mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewer--if you want a phone-phone (without all the extra hoopla) this isn't a bad deal. i *bought a red slice a couple of weeks ago (take note that i'm not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear) and for my needs (emergencies quick calls to family from the grocery store) it's just right. good points: i got mine for *free with reward zone points at best buy. fits into a small purse or pocket easily. nice looking (someone mistook it for a chocolate the other day). clear reception (long distance calls are just as crystal as local; not sure if this is an area thing but apparently the service in and around chicago's solid). pay-as-you-go option works well for someone who doesn't spend a lot of time on the phone. my slice holds a charge just fine (i've noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem but so far so good) and doesn't heat up as someone else mentioned (maybe that reviewer's got a defective phone or battery?). not so good points: it's so slim my husband has bet me i'll lose the phone within a couple of months (could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk). someone else mentioned the odd graphics (hot dog dripping blue sauce some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth. seriously i have no idea what those things might be) but i say it's workable if you have a sense of humor (: yes the buttons are small. i have small hands slender fingers and i still manage to bump the 3 whenever i'm trying to shut off the phone. sometimes it's difficult to turn on (the button doesn't always respond when i push it though could be i'm a wimp) but once it's on it's fine. i'm thinking this will get broken in with more use. all in all it's not a bad phone. beautiful red. i find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty (phone confessions!). i'm satisfied with mine. and since i haven't forked out hundreds of dollars--or any dollars really--i won't feel too guilty when/if i do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork! ",positive
" i got my slicer past black friday for $19 from radio shack to use in the case of emergency. the virgin plan 18 c/min pay as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone for what they were originally made to do. first $20 phone card lasted me little bit over 2 months (one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active) despite a fact that i even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced 30c/min to eastern europe. i used the phone on my business trip to call home. the reception was excellent in all 7 states i used the phone so far. the virgin web site is excellent. the account is easy to recharge. they also have planty of ring tones and graphic options for downloading (mostly priced about $2 per download). the phone is nice looking and has all fancy stuff except a camera. however the memory is really small for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for $19. i am surprised to hear that other people complained about the battery life. my phone holds charge about 3-4 days on stand by. the only bad thing i discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone (for example during the flight) i had to reconnect phone to charger in order to activate it again. i would sincerely recommend the phone and the virgin pay as you go plan to mature users ",positive
" as a basic phone the slice rates ok. i have only a few minor complaints. 1) when a headset is attached the phone does not ring through the external speaker. so if you are not wearing the headset when a call comes in. the call will be missed. 2) there is no option to use vibrate and ring at the same time. it can vibrate or it can ring. 3) the battery life is not as good as stated. in standby the phone runs out of power after about six hours. 4) with text messaging there is no reply option. to reply to a text you have to start a new message and then search for the sender of the original message. 5) the ring tones that come with the phone are horrible. aside from those few problems i have been quite satisfied with the phone ",positive
" two week review i got this phone to use as a phone and am very happy with it. i have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review. first the qualifier. i have a nice canon camera and don't want to use my phone to take pictures. i don't want to use my phone to listen to music or surf the internet either i just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there. if you are one of those people that has a different agenda for your phone then this is probably not the phone for you. the good size is great. this phone is comparable to a hershey bar in thickness and width but shorter. it fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky. it makes a razr feel thick but i am guessing it is comparable to a slvr. the slice has good sound quality for such a small phone. it also has good reception. sprints network is not the best in my area but my slice has been able to connect wherever i am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar. when i was in the car the road noise got too loud to hear but when i hit the speakerphone button i could hear fine and keep my hands on the wheel. virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phone a lot. i expect to spend between $150 and $200 this first year including the $50 up front for the phone. the cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes and fees included. although i haven't tried them it looks like the monthly plans with virgin are pretty reasonable too if i start getting into that kind of usage level. many of the other virgin phones look like toys. although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it it also looks like a real piece of equipment. as an older professional i am not embarrassed to plop this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the vp. (in vibrate mode of course) at the same time my 12 year old is hoping i hate it and get another phone so he can have this one because it is so cool. the ui is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu. what were they smoking when they decided to use a pig for my account a dragon for messaging etc. other than that the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive. can't really comment on reliability on this phone after just two weeks but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine. the bad perhaps because they are affordable in other ways virgin screws you on ringtones and background. the four ringtones included are unacceptable and you are blocked from up or down loading your own. they do have a pretty big collection on their website you can get for $2.50 a pop but none of them sound like a phone. the included wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too so you are likely to fork out $2.00 for a wallpaper from their web site for that as well. the buttons are a little too small. most of the time i do fine but every once in a while i hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small. of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set i haven't run into that problem any more. battery life has not lived up to what i read but that might be because of how i use it. if i charge it every night i am fine. i ordered an extra charger to keep in the office and one for the car as well just in case. summary after two weeks i am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone calls. it is not big on extras like a camera but what it does it does well. virgin uses sprint's network see if you can find out about their network in your area before you buy a virgin phone.

" i really like my lg vx4400 phone even though there are lots of cooler phones out now. i've used it for 3 years and really like it's basic functionality. the battery lasted for 3 years until recently and that's pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have low-battery life. i'm hoping it'll last for 2 more years before i get a new phone to catch up with the modern world ",positive

" the speck rubber case is the best case i've found for my blackberry 7290. that being said it's not ideal and i'd make a few changes. pros -- protects case well; no screen scratches; minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag; no need to use the belt clip (most women prefer purses/totebags to belt clips!); and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages (no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag). cons -- clear case collects dirt; screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight; screen cover doesn't fit squarely into the rubber case; and screen cover gets scratches on it making the screen harder to read. i get a lot of compliments on this case it's different enough to be noticed and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case. however because of the cons i suspect i'll need to replace this case more than once a year. but i like it enough that i'll pay the $35 to do so. maybe the next version will have some improvements. in the meantime i feel like i'm getting my money's worth out of it.

" i'm not really a gadget guy and what gadgets i do have get pretty beat up. when the company gave me a blackberry so i can stay in touch i needed to at least take care of the thing. so i bought this skin from speck products. its is absolutely awesome! no more dings or scratches. i'm a minimalist and for that the blackberry skin is perfect! a cool look not bulky. easy access to the buttons. they did their homework on this product. a must have for anyone who owns a blackberry. i also see they have these for the treos ",positive

" this case is superior. it attaches easily and i especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen you're hosed). the only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is the belt clip. it's bulky and impractical. just a simple tension clip would have been fine ",positive
" i have had this for 2 months now and it has worked out well. i use it on my cingular 8125 phone while i exercise i can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone. when a call comes the audibleplayer pauses and i can answer the phone with the built-in button. voice quality is fine on my end (in both ears) and i have received no complaints from the other end unlike the other reviewer (maybe he got a bad unit or his stereo connector is dirty?). when the call is over the audibleplayer resumes. i never have to stop my exercise or even slow down! my only complaint is that the volume control doesn't work worth beans. when you rotate it at various positions you will hear from one ear or the other. there are a few positions where you will hear in both ears; but that is not at the maximum volume. this is a bit annoying but something i can live with. i just leave it at one position (close to the max volume but a little less) and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume ",positive
" it is so flexible and high quality sound/volume control just plug in a headset of your choice and you can: * listen to music on your treo 650 * headsets sound awesome on it * it will automatically shut off the music when the treo 650 rings and you can simply pick up the call with your headset still on * has an awesome volume control * works with any headset and you can hear it in both ears by the way * i keep my headphones on while on treo cell phone calls because it has a built in mic which is perfect. no one can even tell i am on a headset * i have a stressful job and listening to music while i am working in my home office with headset and the ability to pick up calls and leave my headset on with microphone is really great buy this now - your quality of life will increase ",positive
" i have had this phone for almost 2 years now. i have dropped it many times- still works. in dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants i let it dry out for 1 day and guess what- it works. i am still using it as it works perfectly - even the camera. i used my sisters razr phone this weekend and i hated it. the redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable. i will be keeping my samsung for as long as it lives ",positive
" this samsung is the most reliable phone i've ever had. i've had it for two years dropped it numerous times and it is still going strong with only a few scratches. the battery life has declined during this period of time but it still lasts about two days before charging. while it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now i am impressed with how many applications i use daily - alarm clock scheduler memo pad etc. reception is usually good too. in all honesty though the camera is not terribly great. pictures tend to have a weird color tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry. i still enjoy the camera if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options (black and white brightness flash etc.) to make pictures look decent. the video option is rather lame though as the footage is choppy and you can't even transfer or send it to anything. recently when i was on a shuttle two girls both with razors saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well. both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones. i am supposed to be getting a new phone too but i know i will be keeping this one as a back up. if you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phone this is a good one ",positive
" almost 2 years ago my fiance and i signed up for a 2-year contract with verizon. we got a great deal for both phones. and two years later both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents. this is a great phone for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily. i have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone. pros: - sturdy: it's not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultra-thin phones. i have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition. another thing i really like is that when you drop the phone the battery doesn't detach easily. everytime i dropped my old sony ericsson the battery would also detach and i'd have to restart my phone. - compact: though it is on the thicker side this samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it. - good buttons: for those who text message a lot the way the buttons feel can really make a difference. the buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting. - menu & short cuts: on the side of the phone you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow. if you hold # your phone goes into vibrate mode. if press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera & video menu pop up. you can also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press up i have mine set on the calendar. - long battery life: i'm not one to spend hours on my cell phone but for every day use this phone is great with respect to its battery life. there have been times when i forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged. - camera has flash & other neat options: you can also adjust the brightness level have a self timer take multiple shots 10 different fun frames and 5 different colortones like sepia monochrome (black & white and negative. - zoom: you can zoom upto x4. - phonebook: contacts are easy to access and it's easy to search for entries. i like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under one name. you can enter that persons home mobile fax office and pager number. you can also enter an alias and email address. you can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups. - voice commands:by pressing & holding the * button a voice command menu appears. it's a nice feature but is not something i often use. - speed dailing: one feature that i do take advantage of is speed dailing. it's nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another person. - menu styles: there are 2 different menu styles you can use. i like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through. my fiance uses the icon style which is a more simple design. - custom welcome and goodbye screen. cons: - video quality is poor and very pixelated. my phone only holds 2 15-second videos. - despite the generous 15 ring tones it's hard finding a ringtone that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. out of the 15 ring tones there are only about 2 decent ring tones. - antenna: i don't use the antenna very often but when i do it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy. - picture quality is not the best. if you intend on taking a lot of pictures i would recommend investing in a better picture phone. - does not have v-cast. - no mp3 player. overall: this cell phone is exactly that a cell phone to make calls. it has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone.

" the case fits like a glove! appears high quality with the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching. the cover and back were easy to attach and did not scratch my phone which i checked by removing the case. my only complaint was that i did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since i never carry my phone on my belt. the attachment kept my phone from laying flat. no problem if you slide off the back cover and take off the small foam piece on the inside you will see a tiny screw. just unscrew and remove the mount. there will be a hole in your cover; if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece. attach the back cover to the phone and then fill in the hole with a piece of felt. looks fantastic. if you are a clip user the clip is clear plastic and cheap looking and i found it difficult to remove the phone from it. but maybe that is a good thing so that it won't fall off accidentally. i cannot comment on how well the case will wear since i have only had a few days. my friends that have seen it love the new look. i chose the navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the case fits the phone. awesome!!

" for the $50 bucks you pay here you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime. that's not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere it would be $20 bucks and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately $20 some odd bucks or so. plus tax. so cost works about to be about the same. frankly i see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere. regarding the sim card i noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion. a sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to esd -electro static discharge- just like computer ram is. esd is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed. i'd bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows. before you handle the sim card you should ground yourself by touching something metal. otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with esd. the phone itself is ok. it's basic. emphasis on the basic. i just transferred my mobile # from a motorola v120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139 about the only edge the c139 has over the v120c is the color display. please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper. imo motorola could have added a port to accomodate a usb interface to this model. it was short-sighted and just dumb not to considering the v120c -also in the same price range- has such a port. voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time. i only just had the phone activated on this past saturday (10/28/06) and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone. also it is an entirely new network. in southern california the network this model tracfone uses is cingular. suffice it to say i followed all the instructions on the website explicitly however cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesn't recognize my number and to input my voicemail number. and around and around it goes. i anticipate nothing but problems with technical support when i contact them. they are very polite as customer service reps however they can barely speak or understand english. i am envisioning hours of bs with the call i have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatsoever. note to tracfone: customer service reps from mexico who can barely communicate with your american consumers are most assuredly not tech support. also i wasn't overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging. the v120c is actually more intuitive. it's much easier to use. but the c139 does have one advantage in this regard - text messages cost only 0.3 units versus on the v120c tracfone was deducting 0.5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message. i'm not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone. it should be one uniform deduction across the board. consumers should contact tracfone customer service and inquire about this phenomenon. bottom line is that i would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic led phone and wants an *inexpensive* phone with a much easier on the eyes color display. inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for $20 bucks. but if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper and a little more flexibility then get yourself a nokia 2126. for the same money you spend here the nokia is a better phone. it has a usb port a speakerphone plus other extras. and you probably won't have any trouble setting up the voicemail either.

" i bought this phone as part of the sprint/nextel sero plan. i used it for about 14 days before deciding that it didn't fit my needs for several reasons outlined below: - battery life was sporadic -- i got maybe a day worth of power from it. one time it completely discharged overnight. for the price of the phone (and the two year contract it carries) this is a dealbreaker. - the nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area (i was a former nextel subscriber for 3 years - so i have some experience with coverage around town). i was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals. - the phone would sporadically mute the ringer. an incoming call would light up the display but there would be no ringing. this seems to happen after i had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring. - for the same monthly service fee i was getting less access to web services and no high speed internet ability. admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen -- but if i'm going to be locked into a 2 year contract i would like to have some fast internet access on the phone. the i880 still uses the slow nextel data network. i was not a direct connect/walkie talkie user. if i were then my opinion of this phone might be a little higher (since nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network). i could not justify being locked into a 2 year contract with equipment that seemed sub-par on a network that did not (and likely never will) support the latest high speed technologies. below were my initial impressions during the time i used the phone: thankfully motorola designed the phone so the micro-sd card is accessible from the outside -- no need to pull the battery to update the card. here's the big things i don't like. 1. you cannot use any mp3 songs that you transfer to the micro-sd card as ringtones. 2. you also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download. any message (mms) that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper. 3. battery life on my phone is flaky - i'm getting maybe a day and one-half with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages. you must pay nextel to download ringtones. there are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their micro-sd memory card - however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with. note: sprint and nextel are both owned by the same company. if you're making a decision on sprint vs. nextel there are only a couple reasons that i can think of to recommend nextel over sprint. first if the nextel coverage is better. second if you have a need to use the nextel walkie talkie feature. the sprint side of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications. the nextel side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrial/construction market. for almost every consumer the sprint side is a better deal. sprint in my experience has better customer service whereas nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives. here's my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks: the good: -beautiful speaker phone -compact design / solid feel -2 megapixel camera ability to capture movies -flip swings open when you push a button -nextel sms/mms messages can now be auto-downloaded - i believe this is the first nextel phone to sport this feature -nice loud audio -both nextel walkie talkie and directalk support the bad: -can't play ringtones off micro sd or via any other non-nextel transfer (note: technically some people have been using a motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable - but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle) -nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carrier soon to be completely assimilated into the sprint side of things. while not entirely unexpected it means that nextel plans and features are not as attractive to non-construction users (nextel's core group). if you want mobile to mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most sprint plans which include them. nextel doesn't have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers. most web browsing on nextel is limited to character based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens. -the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to. -while not phone related some users in larger cities have reported the iden system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals. -i am only getting about a day of battery life - which is extremely low.

" very well-thought design. i just wished i looked up at the pictures on here again before i pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first. i thought it was weird. but after i looked at the pictures again.. man.. how brilliant! they should've provided some sort of user guide on how to put the case on. and the leather is of a very high quality too. the seller is awesome very amazon-like shipping (i.e. fast) ",positive
" this product is definitely worth the $30. the leather is nice and what you can't see from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard. when closing the keyboard the plastic does catch a little but i think that will go away the more i use it. the phone fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior. access to the buttons have been made easy. each exterior button is given its own hole in the leather. the ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating ok and ptt. the leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to the touchscreen. on the flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc. another thing not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belt clip however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case. highly recommende ",positive

" consumer reports correctly deemed the samsung wep200 bluetooth headset as the best. i can hear my callers while driving and they can hear me. the samsung is also an extremely small and discrete headset so you won't look like a cheesy phone operator while driving in your car. and if you want to be one of those people who use their bluetooths while walking around in public places it's small enough where people will really wonder if you're a crazy person talking to yourself. gimme a break! the samsung also comes with a cool carrying case that doubles as a charger. this is super handy since the headset is so small and would be easy to lose or damage if not for the sturdy (but not at all bulky) carrying case. the samsung is the first bluetooth headset that i did not quickly return due to poor headset volume. i returned my lg and nokia bluetooths after my first few drives in my car. i simply could not hear the people to whom i was talking. the samsung is the first to provide enough volume. i'm still happy with it after two months of ownership. the samsung was also approximately $35 cheaper on amazon than at best buy or other retailers whether online or in person. so buy it from amazon's retailers. the only reason i gave the samsung four stars and not five is because of the short talk time and because it does not stay in your ear while running. i learned this one morning when i was late for work and ran from my car to my office. the samsung quickly began to fall out of my ear. if the samsung's short talk time is not a concern for you then i doubt there are too many other bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performance in such an extremely small package ",positive

" there are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate. lots of good features in the 8525. my intent is to document some of the shortcomings of the 8525 and windows mobile os in the hope that ms and htc will heed and correct in the future. i am a business user who wanted to combine my hp ipaq 1945 and my motorola v550 cell phone into one device. i use a motorola h700 headset with my old devices and the 8525. my overall assessment is; replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that i don't think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use. all the features i describe below were in the earlier windows mobile os used by my ipaq 1945 or my motorola flip phone. if readers find that there is a way to perform any of the deficiencies i describe please let me know. my suggestions in rough order of priority: 1) blue tooth headsets. blue tooth audio should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the pda volume setting. to hear my voice commands repeated i have to turn on the annoying sound of the pda so when i voice dial via my blue tooth headset i can hear my voice commands repeated back. i am referring to the standard voice dial that comes with the 8525. one quick solution would be to tie bt headset to the phone volume setting rather than the pda. even nicer would be an upgrade that allows full audio with the voicecommand software (this is documented in many other reviews). another nice feature of my motorola cell phone was as soon as the bt was detected the phone volume changed from vibrate to audio if it was set to vibrate. it changed back to the original audio setting after turning off the bt headset. 1a) if i request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screen should always display the voice dial page. instead the initial owner info page stays up and you can't see the name on the screen unless you reach down and tap the screen. not desirable when driving. if you didn't set the pda to its annoying noise level you can't hear the name you requested either. 2) need to be able to control the pda and phone volume independently for audio vibrate or off. for example need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the pda volume setting on off or vibrate. 3) need to be able to program how long the display stays on. i am constantly groping to find the power button on the side to keep the display on as it turns off when i need to see something. 4) i would buy a non bluetooth headset if one was available for long drives when my bt headset battery is dead. only solution i see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while driving on the freeway. 5) provide a built in way to make the ptt and comm manager and ie quick key buttons programmable. i would use them for many other functions; such as ptt bringing up the volume control so i can change it from vibrate to audio to speaker (need to be able to select speaker here see below). 6) give me a way to press an external button to toggle between speaker on and off. i can't easily push the speaker icon with my fingers. suggestion. add a radio button on the volume control that allows you to select speaker phone. yes you can select the phone speaker soft button but often the display has gone blank and the keypad is showing. turning speaker on/off should be easier. 7) provide option to save email attachments to storage card. that was on my ipaq windows os and allowed me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory. 8) remember the filter setting i selected for tasks. if i have filtered by a task category during that session remember the filter i selected. currently i have so many tasks there is a 5 second delay to bring them all up 9) give me a way to turn off have the internet browser quick key (or make this button programmable) i am always having to close the browser because it gets hit/selected 10) let me edit/paste with one step for notes word task notes etc. the ipaq has edit at the bottom. with 8525 os you must select menu then edit then copy. keep edit on the bottom. question: is there a key on the keypad to select cntrl c for copy like what is done on a pc (the letters are underlined in the menu but i don't see a cntrl key on the keypad? 11) allow the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on the top and then use the nav button to move across the icons (might be the way to allow an external way to set audio volume) 12) if i power off the device have it remember my input selection. for example i select letter recognizer. but i must reset each time i power 8525 off. ",positive
" i recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do. however eventually i found out that the phone part of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phone. my friends complain that they hear a lot of outside noise while talking. the phone ear-volume is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places. pros: software : the windows applications - word excel media player. plus : ability to create office documents and play games hardware : micro sd slot - sandisk card cost me 20 bucks. wireless internet : you could connect this device to any wireless unsecure network to get to the internet. i dont have a data plan with cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my wifi home network. if iam at a coffee shop i could connect to their secure network and get to internet for free. cons : * a bit bulky to carry around. * camera is not as expected. the view finder is sloppy and cannot capture images in low light. * battery needs to be charged every second day (depends on usage) but even with light use i had to charge it every other day. best suitable for : * internet savvy people who are on the move. * email and messaging. * as a pocket pc. * to listen to music (need to purchase micro-sd card) accessories: boxwave leather case ($30) leather case by boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device. the only problem is that after you put this case on the phone volume needs to be set to the max even after that you wont be able to hear the other person so well. but the boxwaver case could be opened half way and folded over. bluetooth this device works very well with blue tooth. bottom line: if you are ok with minor inconveniences while using the phone this is for you.

" this is a wonderful device. build quality is typical of htc meaning very good. the call quality is good provided you're in a decent service area (system not overloaded with amr-hr kicking in). the scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable. the slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback. there is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult (this is perhaps the ultimate geek phone). the wm5 rom it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools. there is a learning curve involved with windows mobile but imho it's not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be. in general things work as they are supposed to with this phone. one drawback is that while the device does support the bluetooth a2dp profile (stereo bluetooth sound) the microsoft bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible. the phone ships with a2dp forced to mono which means you'll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth. the bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve. and even after all of that there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio. in other words don't waste your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously. however the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular (mono/one ear) bt headsets (i recommend the jawbone) and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable. another audio related drawback of this device: there is not even a 2.5mm stereo jack. the only physical audio out is through htc's proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack. the saving grace here is that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable and also the availability of htc-to-3.5mm jack adapters on the market. even with a few shortcomings i would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best pocketpc phone on the us carrier subsidized market. it packs an incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor. if you're in need of a windows mobile device and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices this is your phone ",positive
" purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skool verizon xv6600 and i am extremely impressed. i have been a pocketpc phone user for several years now and it appears the 8525 along with windows mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this it professional-by-day \ gadgetfreak-by-night guy. if you don't read anything else in my review please understand this: 1) this is a microsoft os and things will go bump. 2) if you are not in the market for spending around $110 a month for a service plan (voice and data) you have no business with this phone. this is a productiviy enhancer it is not %100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day this phone does the trick. the battery life isn't that bad as i have this thing in its cradle (not included) during the day. screen is bright. the wifi feature works beautifully. the 3g network is amazingly fast. works flawlessly with my exchange 2003 server. (active sync is so easy to setup a noob could do it.) the only reason reason i didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it can't make me a cocktail ",positive
" this phone is also sold as the dopod 838 pro in asia (it's quite popular in singapore) and the htc tytn in europe but in an unlocked model. and quite a bit more expensive than what cingular sells it for here. if you are using this as your first pda phone from another non windows product you will think it's a heavy over feature laden product that you will never fully use and its a problematic one at that. having said that this is probably one of the best windows pda phones available today. the features of this phone (3.5g bluetooth 2.0 etc. ) are such that you would never need to bring a laptop with you. you can even install skype mobile on this phone. the keyboard stows away well and has good feel. there were initial problems with this phone in the asian market that have now been since resolved and is now robust and reliable. but one caveat to keep in mind when using this product...it runs windows mobile. meaning if you are not familiar with windows devices it may frustrate you...it doesn't respond like a non windows cell phone. but if you can overlook that it will perform better than anything available...even blackberry devices do not compare to this ",positive
" many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but i give a try on this brand-new 3g/wi-fi/camera equipped smartphone. the 3g and wi-fi works very well in our area. it also worked very well in europe after activation of the cellphone by cingular customer service. e-mail and internet works very well in both locations. addition of 1gb microsd chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues since i can simply stick the microsd card into regular sd cassette and use a card reader and usb cable for file transfer from pc or mac like other memory chips. the color calibration and default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone. again 1gb allow you to take a very long video in windows media player format. installation of good mail system automatically synchronize to lotus note emails contacts and calendar any time any place and automatically chime schedule notices. the only drawback are the battery life which require frequent charges slow keypad for phone calls (and i do not know how to silence the keypad) and a little tough keyboard touch. lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult (especially shift+a !). in addition microsoft word processing is slow and so as excel which will require a faster chip. overall a great all-around pocket pc in this generation ",positive

" hi i just recently purchased this phone. and so far these are the problems. yes you do have to restart the device it does get hung but i don't blame the phone after all it has windows mobile 5 in it. the restart has occurred twice to me in the past week so be careful. this phone is pretty close to being perfect. other than the fact that it has windows the 3g connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have. if you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature.. which in return will give u a nice thick bill.. once you buy the phone i suggest that you get this software spb pocket plus. it helps shutting down softwares running in the background and adds more features. the screen clarity is amazing and it has great features. it can connect up to 6 bluetooth devices at once. overall i give it a 4 because of the hardware. the one star missing is cause it has windows. sorry microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too.

" i bought this cable knowing by reading the reviews that it might not work so for the price i gave it a shot. this usb cable was a replacement for my other cable that was used as a chew toy by my dog. since i already had datapilot (susteen) software already installed as soon as i plugged it into my computer with the phone attached it saw it as a (susteen usb cable) and installed all the drivers on winxp if you don't have susteen drivers/software you can obtain the drivers for the usb cable for your phone from their website (free download). i never used the installation cd that came with this usb cable and i installed this cable on 3 different computers and yes it also works with the datapilot software but i like using bitpim software for my vx830 ",positive
" my tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thank you.

" i've had my tracfone for about 5 months now. the reception has been generally good. once i got the phone activated i haven't had any problems. tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes. all you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral. my email is debsclay@gmail.com thank you ",positive
" very good phone. nice color screen. easy to read. lots of features ",positive
" my experience using the tracfone has been good. coverage and connections are not a problem ",positive
" extra styli are probably useful for the vast majority of us who lose things. this is one better as it has a pen built in. just unscrew the tip of the stylus and you've got a pen. you never know when you'll need one so when you do there it is. it also blends in well with the design of my treo 700wx both visually and tactile-ly. good stuff ",positive
" the product came promptly and i am happy with the quality. however fitment wasn't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo. not a huge problem but something i would feel everytime i reach for the stylus. but the pen works pretty good and it feels sturdy in my hands. i would definately recomment this product to others ",positive
" this is the original and at half the price of the newer charger this is a really great buy. fully functional and provides all that it should as a charger for the v188 ",positive
" roi is great. working very nice for me. been using this for the past 2 months. fried my original one when used it abroad with wrong voltage ",positive
" excellent price for the charger. original motorola equipment. shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive item. shipping was very fast. i definetly will continue to do business with amazon and a1 accessories. very pleasant and uneventful shopping experience ",positive

" i recently bought a nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones. however the nokia ca-53 cable was around 50 dollars. this was a great alternative. so far everything that i have used it for is working flawlessly. i would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the ca-53 ",positive
" this product helps you copy anything on your computer to your nokia phone.i love it to death and use it almost everyday.eforcity really did a good job shipping it to me and i completely want more bussiness with them ",positive
" works fine. difficult to connect but connects securely. comes with an unlabeled cd (couldn't tell one side from the other) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones aren't labeled in any helpful way. i was impressed. it also has links to any 1st party software you need though i'm sure a google search would be just as easy ",positive
" i bought this case for my lg chocolate and it is perfect. the belt clip is very strong making accidental unclipping rare. the pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts. the front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets. the bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the chocolate's end button. this allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case. the only dislike i have is the name cellnet embossed on the front flap but this is not really a big deal. i would recommend this case to anyone who owns a chocolate ",positive
" i've had this case for under a month but it's working great. when i first got the case i thought i was going to have to send it back because i thought it was too small for my phone(i have an lg cu500 from cingular.). it was a pretty tight fit but it worked. the case has since seemed to stretch a little so it is a lot easier to get my phone in and out ",positive

" prompt delivery excellent quality a nice bonus - hard shell case! that doesn't ruin razr's stylish look a single bit ",positive

" this is a nice cellphone. i got it from a local cellphone shop. free and only 1 year contract. eventually prices will be free like the motorola razor v3. small phone and i like the mp3 player mode : ",positive

" i've had this phone for a week. i'm using it with t-mobile so your mileage may vary. in my opinion it's a feature-packed phone at a reasonable price (for an unlocked smart phone at least). the symbian 9 os runs pretty well although i did experience some lags and software freezes (with third-party apps). fixing it was a matter of rebooting. i think the menu organization could be smarter but you can customize much of it. i do love that the default screen displays your day's calendar agenda. but that screen hides the main menu. not a huge drawback but it confused me at first. photos with the 3-megapixel camera are grainy (it also has a vga camera). since this is a phone first and not a camera there is also no stabilization control. it does however come with a flash. sound quality of phone calls is okay. your friends family and colleagues will hear you clearly. on your end however it will sound like you're talking on a cell phone. it's not bad but i've had conversations on better sounding phones. i disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet (wlan) access. it's possible to set a default access point. the problem is that if you aren't at that location regularly you will have to search for a new network. one way around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider. i agree however that some kind of one-button auto-detect would be ideal. i don't like the sim card slot. the metal cover pops off fairly easily -- as i found out while trying to insert my sim card without reading the manual first. the phone's slider form factor moves smoothly perhaps too much so. by default sliding the phone completely open -- something that's hard but not impossible to do accidentally -- unlocks the keypad. the n-80 is also bit awkward. it feels thick for lack of a better word. its 5-way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than you'd probably expect. another drawback: no qwerty keyboard. you can connect to a wireless one via bluetooth. but that assumes you want to carry a keyboard. the upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid and sensible. when enabled it works contextually: on automatically for sms and email messages and off when typing urls. overall i give this phone high marks for features but a few annoyances mean it's far from the perfect phone ",positive
" i got this phone 2 weeks back although i have seen this with my cousin in singapore quite sometime back. just right off the box the phone is quite impressive. many complain about the response time - yes this phone is slow but doesn't bother me - far better than my windows machine  overall very good phone for what it offers. pros: * this phone tops in ergonomics ease of use presentation features bluetooth speakerphone and call quality. * wi-fi is worth mentioning separately. it is simply superb. * nokia's connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market. it handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several access points and save lots of money. i accidentally downloaded a big chunk of data and going to pay through my nose next month! * all the apps that come with this phone are quite good. * bt sync with my apple is just fine with isync. also i transfer music/themes/ringtones using data cable from my wintel. the phone automatically toggles to mass storage mode when it is connected to pc which is pretty neat. * i haven't faced any such problem as i charge my gadgets daily. i also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes for 2-3 days good enough for my call volumes. * symbian browser is fast and stunning. bookmarks feature is neat. having the wi-fi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks while you're at home and then use it wisely while you are away. * camera quality is good. dual camera is just a great idea. camera settings are similar to professional cameras - very very impressive! * tried the video mode and came fine. * battery life as many claim seems short - but i charge my gadgets daily - so not a big issue * the headset that comes with the phone is really good. * tonnes of themes apps etc available for this phone..... cons * my first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed. it is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times i selected an option when i was actually trying to navigate to left. it is so frustrating. * my second biggest problem with this phone is when the slider is on the screen light does not come up. so you won't know - even in the day - which button to press to answer the question unlock phone? - you will get that by practice but it is truly a pain. * the process of taking a picture sucks. the picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutter sound is not what you get. there is a serious lag between the shutter click and the final image. i sincerely hope if there would be some s/w patch for this. i am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras - with an exception of sony ericsson w810i. that is one far superior camera quality i saw so far. * slider lock and unlock feature is good and bad. i am putting this on the bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket the phone could turn on and end up with accidental redialing. so you would need a small app to do the locking properly. overall - good phone. at this point nokia has better phones like n95 etc - of course very expensive. ",positive
" i think this is going to be a very good phone but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800.00 + dollars. well i called nokiausa direct and regular retail from them is 499.00 all day as many as you want so it should be considerably less on amazon. you would think ? i guess not ! ",positive
" i recieved good customer service and excellent help from these guys. thanks for allowing me to keep this phone with my network. i have so many acessories for this phone. i didn't want to give it up just yet and you allowed me to get another phone just like the one i had. thanks. ",positive
" my v180 is through cingular - i never have a dropped call and reception is excellent. long battery life very easy menus/wayfinding and small size. no frills like mp3 player or camera however - just a very good phone ",positive
" i've had this phone for a year and a half with no problems. it is good for making calls which is really all i ask for from a phone. it is easy enough to use that i even bought one for my elderly parents and they've had no problems. my carrier is cingular and i've had excellent service in the ny tri-state area and because it is a quad-band phone i've also been able to use it while roaming internationally. battery life is just okay (not as good as my old nokia)...i have to recharge every other day with normal use. overall it's lasted me long enough that i would call it a good value.

" if you're the type of person that doesn't spend hours on the phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you. i bought this phone in the uk at the carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great. i would say that the only gripe about this phone in the us is the price i wouldn't pay over 40 bucks for it. it's a nice basic phone. the screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones. ",positive
" i must admit i was skeptical about this package. it didn't seem possible that the stuff would actually work for such a low price. even though shipping was steep it was still worth the money. the case fits great and it hasn't cracked at all. both chargers work great! i think maybe my phone charges a bit slower with this wall charger than the one that came with it but i can't complain! i would highly recommend this package. the chargers aren't high quality but they work ",positive
" incredible price for all three items. just for the car charger alone verizon wanted $24.00. the plastic cover for the phone is very good as the razr phone scratches pretty easily ",positive
" this 3 piece combo is a good purchase. the chargers might feel a little light weight or cheap but they work never the less and the case is of good quality. for the price you can not beat it ",positive
" helps reduce clutter and now i can actually close my cup holder tray (acura rdx) ",positive
" this charger is awesome. it is very compact when retracted and when the cord is extended it doesn't get in the way like the spiral cords do. the cord is thin not bulky. i never measured the cord when extended but it is much longer than most ",positive
" this car charger is amazing for the price. you go to your service provider store and buy a car charger and it will cost you 30 bucks but you pay a fraction of that price and buy one of these and it works so much better. the retractable cord is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular or sprint stores. ",positive
" i've had it for about 2 months and i am still happy with it. it has a little blue led light that comes on when the car is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but i like it. ",positive
" as advertised on-time... i've used for two months and it works great... i'd buy from this outfit again.. ",positive
" i like the way it doesn't take up space in the console when i am not using it and it seems to charge the l6 just fine! no complaints with the devise or the service from amazon ",positive
" i'm happy i receive my cable. it fast service. i'll still keep buying from this seller. thank ",positive
" ive had this charger for the last couple of months and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it. it is highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone ",positive
" car charger serves it purpose it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter. the design is basic with no hidden features. you just need to make sure you plug the connector in the right way. i would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device. otherwise a perfect gift!

" excellent qaulity for price. divers easy to loa ",positive
" this product has worked great. the cord is a little short but have had no functionality issues. ",positive
" this was an excellant purchase. it was exactly what i needed and works as well as one that would have cost me $20 or more in the stores ",positive
" not much to say about a battery. i installed it - it works fine ",positive
" i purchased this battery becuase my original battery started acting up on me after 2 years of serviceso it was time. it does last longer and im glad i bought this battery. i have no bad reviews about this so if you have an audiovox 8910 cell phone and you need an replacementthis is the one.but you decid ",positive
" this battery performs as expected. it is the standard palm battery - meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device. note also that when using bluetooth and/or the blackberry rim email service battery life is notably reduced. the solution would be lower device consumption or a bigger capacity battery - neither of which appear possible at the moment. so my solution was to have a second spare battery ",positive
" this product far exceeded my expectations. it installed very easily with no bother and has functioned perfectly since the first day. it has far out performed and put to shame the more expensive bulkier unit it replaced. this navigation system is truly a useful tool when traveling in areas you are not familiar with ",positive
" this is a wonderful cover for your blackberry. very sturdy and easy to use. love it! ",positive
" i did a lot of looking before purchassing a krusell and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch. it was a great investment. the krusell case holds the blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use. cosemetically it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing! the pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards! this is an excellent product ",positive
" i used to forget my wallet but i always had my blackberry so i bought this then since i take my phone every where but not my wallet this salved the problem. this is good for people who forget their wallet or phone but remember to bring the other ",positive
" i love this case because it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one. it is just nice to have to keep up with one less thing. i highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff ",positive
" these are well worth the money for your nextel phone! although it may not list it from experience these batteries fit 95% of all the nextel phones. take a look at your phone battery to see if it's the same shape. the color will be different as these have a white cover. they are a good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local cellular store. plus these were never used before! unlike the celluar store battery these batteries come in a box with the battery in shrink wrap so you know the battery has not been used. when you buy then in the cellular store they are in a plastic box that can be opened and closed (and you'd never know it) plus there is no shrink wrap! ever buy a battery from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months? hmmm i wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one? would you know???? these batteries are well worth it! buy one or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days ",positive
" this charger works perfectly with my samsung blackjack. it is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone ",positive
" this is a great little desktop charger pocket for the motorala v60 and an additional battery. however it seems expensive for what you get not to mention the fact that what the text doesn't tell you is that you need an *additional* (expensive?) serial cable/adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable. unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price...and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges ",positive
" i couldn't believe how small it is compare to the pictures i saw online. however one bad thing about that is that i lost it already. now i have to think about buying another one. anyways it's a cool headset. i would recommand it to anyone who's thinking about buying one. ",positive
" when i lost my stylus i had a difficult time finding a replacement. the others i tried weren't the same. these are. ",positive
" product is great for products such as samsung cell phone models: a630 a850 a950 a970 a930 a990 a645 and a870. the thin adapter makes this charger very easy to plug into crowded outlets to allow you to charge your cellular phone at home or office ",positive
" i originally bought another motorola charger from a verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one. i returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not better! it actually fully charges my phone in less time and i can swear my battery life lasts even longer. it's a great product for a great price! delivery was quick too. ",positive
" this product is great. it fits like a glove and protects the phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases ",positive
" pros: fits the phone very snuggly. made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer. all buttons of the phone are accessible through the case. the belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belt and easily remove and reinstall it on the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of your waist. cons: you cannot access the keyboard without removing the phone from the case. the clear plastic screen that covers the phone's screen is a little to far from the surface of the phone's screen. this makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of the screen. the clear plastic screen protector may stretch with use and make this easier but i'm not sure. on the positive side you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online. ",positive
" picture quality sucks for the price. colors are way freaky. the screen is perfect for text but not for pictures. viewing pictures on this is terrible. keyboard is ackward at first. the manual needs to be much more detailed. sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots. i expected to use it like a typical pilot where you write on the screen. this feature is not implemented. overall this is a very good phone. good reception great sound quality!! speakerphone is great! neat features. worth the $$ ",positive
" the treo600 has all the functions i needed -- phone calendar camera etc. two shortcomings: 1) the screen is not good for viewing pictures but that's what i get for being unwilling to spend more for a treo650 2) the phone failed to dial two times in two months. i had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem ",positive
" it's a very nice phone!!!!!! ",positive
" this is a good thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen. i don't foresee it peeling...ever. it has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on. i've washed mine it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky. just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place. it is extremely sensitive to bending and if you bend it it will never go back. so be extra careful ",positive
" durable thick doesn't interfere in any way with the touch screen. i haven't had to wash it yet so i haven't tried out that feature. but i highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these it's been totally worth it to me (hey after spending hundreds on your treo what's a few dollars?) ",positive
" these javoscreen treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen. typically 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen hope against hope that you don't have bubbles but you almost always do. when the screen is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible..... but these javoscreen protectors are a completely different animal. they are thick and tough and relatively firm. and because of those properties they go on with no bubbles and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time. further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good. this is the state of the art for screen protectors. and this all becomes an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over time the screen will get dulled and scratched. because of the thickness and quality of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.

" i had it up and running in minutes with my lg vx-8600 (verizon). i downloaded bitpm free software to use with the cable. i just followed the installation instructions that came on the cd that comes with the cable. i clicked on discover phone in bitpm to have it automatically find the phone. (i didn't even need to go and look for the com port as the installation says because bitpm scans the ports until it finds the phone) note.. when installing make sure you pick the right driver.. if you have xp choose the xp driver not the nt or win98 or other driver. it's part of the file name..look for xp in the driver file name.

" received exactly as stated. my only complaint is in the description- they don't state the length of the cable. my tower for my computer is in another room that i keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly. i had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall. i projected the cable to be about 6 feet and if you do yourself you're in for a surprise. this cable is only about 3 feet long otherwise everything is fine. one last thing...the description doesn't state this but the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models which really helped me. on a better note shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days usps estimated ",positive

" got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping and it works great drivers work and everything! awesome deal for 3 bucks : ",positive
" works well. driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install. no synchronization software is included so you have to use a third-party tool like bitpim. which is ok ",positive
" i ordered this cable on december 1st got it on the 8th. very quick. brand new. it came with drivers but i didn't need it because i found drivers online. the cable fit perfectly with my lgvx9900 and to my surprise it charges too. i use it to put ringtones on it for free : ",positive
" i recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525 and have had a few problems w/it. first the belt clip is kind of small and broke when i tried to clip it to my belt. second the aluminum case isn't the sturdiest so now it's sort of bent (referring to the hinge i guess i've been really rough on my phone) but i just bend it back to where it's supposed to be (referring to the hinge). but the case does what it's supposed to do...my phone looks and performs just as the day i got it. when i informed the vendor that the belt clip broke i just wanted a new clip instead i recieved a full refund so that was a pleasant suprise. i actually liked it so much i bought my wife one when she got her phone ",positive
" the k790a is currently the best cybershot camera phone in sony ericsson's lineup (but more are on the way) and also hands-down the best camera phone in the u.s. today. it's too bad that se doesn't sell their 5mp and 6mp camera phones stateside. but the k790a is very capable as a digital camera. sure it's only 3mp but like many professionals will tell you pixel count is only one thing. this 3mp camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5mp and 6mp cameras from vivitar aptech (sp?) samsung and other offbrand companies. my main phone is a sanyo m1 with 2mp and i thought it was pretty good for a camera phone but when i got the k790a to use with my prepaid sim card i was simply blown away by the quality. (of course i bought the phone exactly because i had heard of great things about its picture quality but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.) the camera is very easy to use. i don't care for the mms features because my prepaid service (speak out wireless) doesn't support them. i just download them to my pc using a usb card reader. i wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in japan including models from casio now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera. but this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam. i'll use this for a year and upgrade to se's next gen next year hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped k phones. in summary this is a great camera. oh the phone functions are fine too. reception is pretty good on the t-mobile + cingular networks (used by speak out wireless). voice is clear and loud. really good. 5 stars ",positive

" purchased the phone about 3 months like the nice qvga screen and impressed with excellent cam (it works pretty well in macro mode and outdoors) the phone has good reception at least on par with w810 voice call is ok but as other users stated the level is kinda low (esp speakerphone) firmware upgrade (r1kc001) will help the operation is standard se style if you are familiar you'll be ok without reading manual the audio player can play streaming 3gp and realaudio (still used by bbc) and it works well with t-mobile internet; it can play local mp3 (vbr supported) wma asf audio (rename the extension to .wma) realaudio; but i wish it supports ogg vorbis which is the audio format i use bluetooth works pretty well it works with all bt equipment i have (including wireless headphones) logitech headphones users please read: in order to make the headphones works properly you need to go to bt menu and connect from there web browser can handle regular html sites as well as simplified html and wap sites the phone is kinda bulky and a bulge on cam cover but it's pretty comfortable and firm to hold making messaging is a good pleasure though the phone has lot of functions/features are pretty appealing it lacks something it's supposed to have: quad-band this is not acceptable for this price even many lower models have quad-band (k550 w610 w580 w810 z710 w710) music player should have more file format support: ogg vorbis streamimg wma/asf shoutcast m2 memory card though the phone has possibility to support up to 32gb psp card is a lot cheaper pro: qvga screen and it shows clock when the phone is idle wireless headphones support 3mpx cam with auto-focus and xenon flash comfortable and firm to hold con: low earpiece and speakerphone level (though firmware upgrade will fix) tri-band cam cover bulge conclusion: if you want a phone with excellent screen and cam go for it however if you travel a lot settle with quad-band models (they're cheaper ",positive
" i've had 3 cell phones prior to this one all motorola and i really thought they were all pretty good phones... however i recently just made the switch to my new se k790a and this one blows them all out of the water! it's very compact and durable you can tell it was made with an incredible level of quality control. i don't think i'll ever go back to motorola. the camera is a great feature. this is why i bought the phone now i am never without a camera. the flash is good and strong so it takes great pictures with good focus. i don't really use the mp3 feature because i have an ipod. i will not comment on this feature. however i was very disappointed that it wouldn't allow me to use mp3s as ringtones. i heard this was because my service provider is a jackass and not the phone's fault though. with a little bit of forum browsing i was able to hack my way around this (if you have this problem email me at skibum2801@yahoo.com)... now i have my very own custom ringtones that come out as clear as day with the nice speaker. call clarity is much better than my other phones. i feel as if i'm simply using my home phone it's so great. the screen resolution is absolutely beautiful. the buttons took a little bit to get used to (because i was a motorola girl for so long) but i picked it up quickly and now i have no issues.

" this is a great phone. pity you cant get a subsidized version via a carrier. bit pricey but worth it. great camera and interface. super easy to upload pictures straight to flickr via phone. this is a top selling handset in europe - but tricky to get hold of in the us which is still relatively in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology ",positive
" coming from a sonyericsson t637 i was familiar with the se ui so getting used to this phone was relatively easy for me. i love the camera it takes amazing pictures and the music player serves my needs just fine. support for a memory card is a huge plus (i have a 1 gb sandisk m2 micro card) and now i never have to worry about running out of room for music of photos. this phone also allows for extensive customization in terms of shortcuts and themes ringtones and so forth which is another plus. as far as negatives for the phone i only have a few minor ones: the earpiece volume is somewhat quiet and the camera lens cover sometimes slides open in my pocket but neither of these would convince me not to get this amazing phone it's quite possibly the single best phone i've ever owned! definitely very happy with this purchase ",positive

" pros: - best pictures yet (3.2 mega pixels) on a cell phone that i have used - built in flash (rare for cell cameras) - cover over lens on camera - good music player - expandable memory with sony m2 flash memory - fm radio - bluetooth works great - screen has great size and wonderful resolution - edge device makes internet data fairly quick and usable as pc modem (via bluetooth) cons: - keys are small and difficult to press - camera lens cover needs a lock switch (mine opens just walking around and takes pictures of the lint in my pocket) - very annoying - sleep timer is a bit quick and should be adjustable - i shouldn't expect it thinner since it is the size of a very small digital camera but i'd still like it slimmer.

" this phone has all the feature that i wanted. the camera takes really good picture. better than all the phone i've seen so far. the xenon flash really helps taking night pictures. i use to own the w800i and this one takes way better pictures. it has auto-focus and other several fucntion that i haven't used yet. the mp3 player is also very useful. i love how u can just drag and drop mp3 files to the phone. it also very easy to navigate through the phone functions. my computer had no problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded. it's just like plugging in a flash drive. the screen is very bright and clear. the screen resolution is decent. it's very easy to customize also. i dl program online to customize the theme. the battery lasted a lot longer than i expected. usually last around 3-4 days. the only complains i have about this phone is the headphones. walkman series have way better headphones so when you get this make sure to buy new headphones and adapter. another complain is the expensive memory stick micros. i couldn't use the memory from my w800i phone. and i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used ",positive
" i have had it since october and it is clearly the best phone i have ever owned. it has also replaced my camera and i am now never without a camera. i attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited. they don't give the phone a second glance not realizing it's got the 3.2 megapixel capability. i have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows. after throwing in a 1gb memory stick (i think it was $79?) it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300+ pics right now. the movie function rocks too however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject. the sound playback of the movies is fantastic though so at least concert videos make for good listening. the phone works flawlessly with my pc. if i throw it on the usb cable it pops up instantly as another drive just like the camera. just drag on/off the music and pics. all pics are very nicely numbered and named. if i don't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone i don't even take it out of my pocket. the bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around. also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a modem which i actually was able to use immediately in my pc anywhere program. in terms of being a phone yeah it's great. the contact list is easy to work with the call clarity is no issue at all good signal no dropped calls etc. etc. (this is all with cingular). speaker phone works well. it needs charging about every 3rd day charges very quickly. charges slower but with the usb plugged in it also charges. the only thing i can think to complain about is that when using the usb cable to charge it only wants to charge it to 89%. if i want 100% i have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes.

",positive
" this is the third case i tried for my treo 650 and it's simplicity is it's key to success. my first case had a flapping piece of leather that cost $35 and was totally useless. my second skin had a belt clip that whenever i bent over (to tie my shoes for example) the phone would disengage from the clip and fall on the floor! simply bad design. this well designed premium side case is easy to use easy to wear and gives excellent protection. when the phone is in vibrate mode you are always aware when you get a call page or email. it's small enough that it's not a problem when worn with a suit and sits in the right place when driving with a seat belt. good design is always fashionable and the case is well made. i wish it came in brown i'd buy a second! so if you're looking for the right case... this is it. you will not be disappointed. ",positive
" i used to carry my treo 600 with the original case that came with the device. but soon i found out that the original case is kind of loose and my treo fell out from it once. luckily it was on a carpet so no damage (at least no visual damage). after that incident i started looking for a better case and this one is what i found. what can i say you don't know how bulky treo is until you wear one on your belt. the case does its job - it provide a nice and secure protection for treo and it allows you to clip on your belt sideway so you don't have to carry it around with your hand or in you pocket (which barely fit). but treo is quite heavy and it's thick so you will definitely aware your treo is hanging on your belt. and sometime i just feel like it's too much a burden and i want to get it off me. but overall i still prefer to have this than the original case. and the heaviness is not this case's fault should blame handspring (now palmone) for not making it lighter... :- ",positive
" this case is great for protecting my treo but the downside is that i have to remove it from the case to use it. i purchased it because i had actually dropped my treo when walking with it balanced on my portfolio now i clip it to the portfolio and it is secure and safe and i don't run the risk of leaving it behind ",positive

" how come phone accessories don't qualify for prime shipping? how are they different from other electronics ",positive
" this case does what it is supposed to do... it protects your palm treo phone. it is very nice looking and durable. the only negative comment that i will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit. that is why i gave it a 4/5. amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price ",positive

" i was very pleased when i got this cell phone case. i was really frustrated with my phone before purchasing this case. i kept on getting the screens dirty every time i made a call. guess i have oily ears or something. no worries now that i have this case. the things i like about this case: 1.i think it looks cool -- which ... ok does mean something to me. 2.it feels good - it has kind of a rubber feel and the inside is cloth 3. it protects my phone - i have two boys and while they are supposed to not touch dads phone it has an almost 100% chance of getting dropped sooner or later. 4. its not bulky. 5. fits the phone 95% perfect. the things i don't like: 1.like the other guy mentioned the clear plastic covers the camera a little but not a big deal camera is not so hot anyhow. 2. earphone spot is awkward. functional but not perfect. so the good far far outwieghs the bad. i have no buyers remorse and after surveying the options for the v710 i still think this is the best ",positive
" got this a couple weeks ago. the rubber suit covers every bit of the phone so i am confident that i won't be getting any scratched. and it flips open a ok. you can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched. you can't access the tf card. there is a strap that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isn't going to fall out. 3 minor qualms: the see through plastic has a little glare on it especially when there is oil between the lcd and the suit. also it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a little knock. (noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belt). last the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the camera. you already know the v710's camera is crap for its specs but i occasionally have to hold down the little flap. i got used to it real quick ",positive
" i just got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice. it feels solid and professionally made not some cheap import special. i like the blue led light instead of the typical red dot. also the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging. the ic chip is important so that you don't overcharge your phone battery and shorten it's life. i would buy again. great price for a quality charger.

" the only problem is that it can only hold the standard battery so your out of luck if you're using the extended battery for your a920 phone. an e-mail to krusell confirmed this. other than that it's a very nice and stylish case for the samsung a920 phone ",positive

" if you want a cell phone that is well made looks good feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the v360 is an excellent choice. it has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that i don't want. it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use ",positive
" i bought my v360 on ebay and it was sold unlocked/unbranded and it was of the quad-band variety. here's my take: pros: -durability; this thing was built with the clumsy in mind (like me). i must have dropped this thing a dozen times and there's barely a scratch. -mp3 player; i agree that the onboard 5mb of memory is a joke but with the cost of transhflash memory coming down (i bought my 512mb chip on ebay for $7.99) then upgrading is easy and affordable. that being said the mp3 player is a feature you will actually use and the sound quality is good. i've had no problem with playing my itunes music (as long as they're mp3 format and no greater that 192kbps in quality then it will play fine.) **media player defaults to wma and itunes defaults to m4a formats - you need to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either program to rip to mp3 format (you can change the default to mp3 in the settings menu) -programmable smart keys; i read where one user complained that the camera button was not on the side it was the camera icon button on the front keypad. he must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the personalize menu. not only that but you can rearrange the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps. it's a handy little feature. -built in bluetooth and edge technology. you may not use these features out-of-the box but they're for the time when these technologies are more commonplace. i use my bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files (mp3's pics etc) to my phone with my laptop. -quad-band world phone capable. this phone works on 850 900 1800 and 1900 gsm networks (although that has not been personally tested). however i will be traveling to micronesia and the uk within the year and i'll know for certain by then. cons: -there's a slight delay when you answer a call - i usually have to say hello 2-3 times or wait a few seconds before i begin to speak. i don't know if this is a carrier problem or the phone. (i use cingular prepaid). -the light stays on while charging (even when the phone is powered off). it's annoying. -the onboard memory is a joke. you really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone. -it has a monochrome outer display (full color inside). this doesn't bother me at all but it's not as flashy as razr or other phones. overall: this is a great durable little phone with handy features i think people will actually use. i've read where people complain about the picture quality - but that's what a digital camera is for. if you want a good quality cell phone that's well designed user friendly and doesn't look like a tricked-out teenager's phone then this is the phone for you.

" as usual motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but this is not all it's more than free you get 50 bucks out of this deal. ",positive
" this is a good solid phone so far. other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual. my biggest complaint that has not yet been addressed in the reviews is that the phone can only hold 30 text messages in its memory. despite having something like five meg of memory on the phone and a micro sd memory card that's it. the size of the text message doesn't seem to matter ",positive
" this is a great phone that i've used for a year now. i'd like to highlight the standout features that make this phone unique especially at its price. mp3 player. just get an adapter for the usb port (a few bucks on ebay) and you can plug in your stereo headphones. too bad they haven't offered an update to the motorola digital audio player. microsd slot. you can take a microsd card put it into the included adapter and plug into an sd slot on your computer and copy mp3s (you can take any mp3 and make it your ringtone cropping it will make it more effective) 3gp videos (animation looks great but the sound was slightly out of sync search the web for video converters to convert your content) or pictures. i love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them. bluetooth. i got an explorer 320 headset for $20 and it works great with it. battery. easily exchangeable. easily slide off the cover and pop in a fresh one. the battery life isn't very long so it's good to have a spare battery they're cheap. video camera. not high quality video but its something the old razr couldn't do. customization. i love customization. you can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone the two on the top of the keypad and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone. it even has a shortcut list to list all your favorite features. you can easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper. also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phone unique. speakerphone. works even when closed. good for using automated phone menu systems and when you're put on hold. the speaker is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s. the plastic may resonate at certain sounds though. vibrating alert. vibe then ring! why doesn't every phone have this?? it should be the default standard for all phones. the vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket. if you are one to show off your ringtone let it move onto ring otherwise be descreet and answer immediately. ----------------------------------------------------------- as for what i don't like. i don't care much for the motorola menu style. i prefer sanyo and samsung interfaces. the menu is the same as a razr or slvr. all the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off. i carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit. i scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it wouldn't look half worn off. ----------------------------------------------------------- all the great features is what keeps me from getting a samsung t509 or other more expensive phones. this phone just has all the fee-free features you could want ",positive
" i purchased this for 24.99 and that was a steal ! pros :- clear voice clarity. nice signals easy set up and sync with the phone runs on nimh batteries. cons:- not a good range.if the cell is in my back pocket jean the blutetooth set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signal break up ",positive
" i recently purchased this motorola hs805 headset and find it more than adequate. for the price it is worth every penny. the ability of using aaa batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect. nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmick. once they finally die your headset is useless. too expensive to send away to repair. so you throw your headset and charger away and buy a new one. that is good for a company but not for you. depending on your ear structure the fit can be either formfitting or loose. from reading the other reviews here one can infer this. for me it is formfitting. also you may infer that the bluetooth telephone or device it pairs to would make a difference in performance. some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or allowed some static. for me and others we experienced no such problem. best bet is to check the return policy if you find that it doesn't meet your standards. but if it works for your device you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talk time on 1 aaa alkaline battery!. and you will never be bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable aaa batteries which is a pretty good idea. if it also fits your ear comfortably then you have a winner ",positive
" the battery life on this unit is great. i can use it daily for an hour or so every day on a single aaa for at least two weeks. (it appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.) i use this headset with both a treo 650 phone and a apple powerbook g4. on the apple i can use it as a generic output device. (i'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) the signal is strong enough on the apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the treo 650 the signal is not nearly as good. the sound is ok. it's not the best. if it's noisy -- e.g. like driving or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast -- or if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly then it's sometimes hard to hear. it'll drop audio -- i.e. the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. you can milk it a while longer but that's really your first clue about the battery. the earpiece is ok; it's not as secure as i'd hope. if you're outside in a gust you may want to hang on to it. also people on the other end sometimes can tell i'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that i sound a little staticky. this is my first bluetooth headset so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. but the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets and it seems like they're always having to charge them. i use rechargeable nimh aaa's and they just last a really long time with this unit ",positive
" i bought this headset for internet chats with my husband when he travels for business. i find it comfortable to wear and easy to use. the sound quality is good volume more than adequate and my husband does not hear any echo. i like the fact that it uses an aaa battery instead of a charger. all you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies. (even rechargeables do not last forever.) the ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear. it would be nice if it bent for a custom fit but i am pretty happy with it ",positive
" i purchased this headset (...)and the key features i like are as follows: 1. aaa battery - no charging! 2. easy to pair with my phone (motorola slvr l7 - european version) 3. no static on both ends. 4. have not had a complaint about echoes as other reviews stated. 5. price - affordable but acts like an expensive headset. 6. volume is good. 7. fits well does not feel lose. 8. 22 hours of talk time before battery has to be replaced. i am very happy with it. i would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset ",positive
" i will only use krusell products as they are better than best. customer service is as good as the product. there is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest. krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price. the rating should be a 10 ",positive
" this charger is an excellent value. it works beautifully with my treo 700p smartphone. i love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button making the whole unit quick and easy to store. the only complaint i've heard is that the large blue power light is too bright at night. it doesn't annoy me but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down so the blue glow doesn't shine up into her eyes. no problem ",positive
" very nice product. the retractable cord keeps it out of the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone. my complaint with all palm chargers is that the weak point is at the connector and they break. but the price on this one is good enough that you should buy 2. ",positive
" i have tried them all. these are the best. no more tangled cords. i only look for cellet when i need a charger. i have delt with cell phones for over 10yrs. why pay $26 for a tangled mess ",positive
" this is an excellent product in that it protects my treo 650 without hiding its style. i chose treo because of its unique look and excellent features however the case from palm didn't work for me because i use the phone a lot and i dont have time to put the phone back in the case everytime. so it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it. i also bought a body glove case and while i can use the phone while in it it hides the treo's real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag. this one seems to even enhance the treo's style ",positive
" i loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands!! anyone who are crazy over that color! ",positive
" excellent people to work with.had a return and they replaced it no questions asked ",positive
" good battery life (certainly much better than the old one it replaced). for the most part it is indistinguishable from the original. however it doesn't fit quite as snugly in the dock-style charger that came with my phone (not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly). that is a little annoying that it tends to fall out -- if i'm not paying attention i'll wake up the next morning and my phone won't actually have been charged -- but it still works ",positive
" this battery saved me from renewing the contractthus the battery was a contract killer.i thought i was going to get a new phone as this battery is 49.99 at the verizon dealer. but you guys saved the da ",positive
" the product is probably a decent product but it doesn't work in my vehicle '04 jetta. i think it has to do with the part you plug into the cigarrette lighter being to long ",positive
" item arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised charges the phone in about 15 minutes of driving ",positive
" i received this very quickly. i couldn't believe i could get the actual namebrand at such a great price. very pleased ",positive
" once again thanks to amazon for this.great product at great price.moreover very reliable.. ",positive
" it worked great just like i excpected. everything is still working well i am very happy with my purchase ",positive
" the cable is exactly what i needed and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives. drivers provided on the accompanying cd worked but were not as complete as i would have liked. i am still very satisfied as it was only the cable that i was really after especially for the price at which i bought it ",positive
" the vehicle phone charger i received was not the one pictured as for sale. it does however appear to be equal in features. i trust it will function as described. __________________________________ i have now used this product and find that it does not work to charge my v170 cell phone. the car's power outlet does work. i have since purchased the motorola charger - more expensive - and it works perfectly. i should have done this in the first place ",positive
" this car charger does what it is spposed to do and the price is right ",positive
" you might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by oem products gives one much peace of mind. i am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if i know what i am getting is not just a counterfeit. i think i got my money's worth ",positive
" after reading reviews here & user forum's i decided to purchase this desktop charging station. it can charge a secondary battery in the rear compartment and can charge the extended life batteries as well while the q is on the charger. the three color led indicator is added benefit w/a simple guide that is located underneath the unit. the charger can not over-charge the battery which is an added benefit. and you can easily access the q while on the charger for sms texts using any app. or even using the speaker phone while on the desktop charger ",positive
" motorola should include this with each motorola q phone as standard equipment. this should not be an add-on ",positive
" great product - works quickly when charging my moto v555 in the car. highly recommend it ",positive
" i simply wanted a data cable to connect my verizon cell phone to my macintosh so i could transfer and synchronize data. verizon was of no help and wanted to sell me a very expensive package that only worked on windows machines. this thrifty cable (&lt; $10) worked perfectly. with the mac-friendly datapilot software ",positive
" this was a whole lot cheaper than the verizon dealer wanted for this product. my only disappointment was that it didn't have clear instructions which was lg's fault ",positive
" cover fits great and for the price i could not find anything better was at the local mall and saw a cover that was the same for around $17. i would recommend this case ",positive
" i just bought this case a few weeks ago and it's holding up very well. it hasn't broken or scratched yet. plus it makes my phone looks a lot better. well i hope this thing will last for many months down the tough road. ciao ",positive
" i would like to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose from? wich colors are there? this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee. please answere asap ",positive
" the case looks great and it is very slim fitting so the phone doesnt look bulk ",positive
" this was delivered as an oem product exactly as expected. it came on time and was very reasonably priced. i will do business with webtreo again ",positive
" very good clip-type phone holder. came as advertised and quickly. ",positive
" i bought one of these extended batteries on e-bay and was really sorry. it didn't hold a charge. i was reluctant to try again but i was glad i did. this time i got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery ",positive
" i am thoroughly enjoying the longer battery life. i had to charge my old battery everyday. i only have to charge the new battery every 2 - 3 days ",positive
" this product is great... i'm glad it came with the cloth too ",positive
" i have tried a dozen screen guards some of them shine a lot some of them are not as clear as they promise some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble. this makes its way through all that problems. well on the other hand it does have a catch 1. finger print magnet 2. the price - that price for one!!! and yea the best part is its static not gum and its washable. ",positive
" the touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice. the onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen (easier sad than done). if anything does attach it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer ",positive
" but it does have some faults. i have had it for some time now i got it for my 11th birthday. i have reviewed the cingular version too even though mines verizon. faults: very short battery life - i have to charge it almost every day! camera - the picture you take can't move or it comes out all messed up. good parts: big screen - easy to read! recording videos - even though you get 15 seconds i still use that to make funny videos with my friends. it's style - i love the color and style! my friends are all jealous. overall i think it's a great phone ",positive
" personally i think if you are buying any sort of razr for its functionality you are buying the wrong phone. i have personally owned numerous lg phones and while they may not be as small light and attractive as motorola phones lg phones are built to last. however if you are just looking for a cute phone that is easy to carry in your purse/pocket and to use just as a nice looking phone this is a great one to own. i previously had the lg vx9800 before i bought the pink motorola razr v3c. i had the vx9800 because when i was in college i would text people constantly and use the aim feature during boring classes. that phone was incredible. however now that i am in the working world and basically only use my phone to call people i wanted a phone that was easier to carry around and was cute. enter the razr. i don't recommend this phone if your phone is your life--it doesn't do much. however if you are just going to be using it to make calls and send the occasional text it's wonderful. the pink color that verizon put out is absolutely gorgeous--it's almost a purpley-pinkish lavendar color. in my opinion this pink is prettier than the t-mobile magenta and much much much nicer than the cingular pink (i am not a fan of that one at all). in essence if you're looking for a high-tech phone this is not it. if you're looking for a lightweight attractive phone just to use for calls and some texting this is a great buy ",positive
" i just got my pink razr phone and i love it so far. i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones. even though it does not have an antenna on the outside that you can see it still it works well. i was scared to buy this phone because i read some of the reviews and some of them weren't saying good things about the phone but i think that they were wrong about it. great job motorola keep up the good work ",positive
" much longer lasting than the standard battery. fast shipping ",positive
" when i first got my motorola q i was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or be caught with a dying battery in mid day. with some setting changes and the 1700 mah battery that is now far in the past. for the price it is an excellent deal. ji ",positive
" a little fatter than the regular battery which means a very tight squeeze in my q-holder but the extra power makes a big difference ",positive
" this item is very excellent. i was suprise it does not comes with 2 screen protector only but also a squeegeem cloth and cleaning instructions. this shield fits very nicely over my phone screen ",positive
" my friend from hk just got this phone and ask me to buy her an eforcity screen protector. she loves it!! ",positive
" younger brother just got the verizon chocolate. he's been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up. its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but i digress. the screen protect works as described it comes with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator. the film has some kind of electrostatic polymer there's no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen. squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed. i would recommend ",positive
" i like this case very much for my blackberry. it definitely improves the grip on the blackberry especially when i'm using it as a phone. it also serves as an excellent protector when i throw it in my purse. my two problems are that i wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the speck ipod protective cases. (come on guys! women use these items too!) also the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the blackberry in the week that i've had this case. other than those two things this is a great not bulky case. ",positive
" it is small and compact easy for travel but also good for home use ",positive
" i am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone...i would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed.. ",positive
" i use my belt holster with all the phones i've owned my i530 is no exception. this belt holster feels really well made it has a strong belt clip which is good for how hard i use it. a big plus is that i can use my phone while it's in the holster ",positive
" works great there are a set of lg head phones that seperate and can be used to adapt your lg phone to what ever you wan ",positive
" an extra lithium battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone. the desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts. it saves time and one last thing to worry about. the charge itself is fast too.. i have found the 750 mah lithium ion battery to be dependable nomatter at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging. it doesn't weakin as did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range. however the first time you charge or recharge your lithium battery is the most important charge of all. you must let the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery. the deader the battery on it's first run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come. highly recommended ",positive
" i love my nextel i530. purchased it almost a year ago now. i am in northern ohio and travel many places around the state. no matter where i have gone and i take my phone everywhere with me i have yet to find a place where my phone doesn't have nextel service. also very durable phone. i live on a farm here and we use the two-way often to communicate. my phone in particular has been dropped several times once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud. still works like new. i am extremely happy with nextel's service and phones. i know several other people with different model nextel phones and also can't complain. i would definitely recommend nextel over verizon alltel cingular and sprint. other companies have such cheap phones it seems. it's a shame that sprint and nextel merged - from my experience with sprint they are terrible with no service anywhere and their phones suck too ",positive
" i have used the i530 for a little over two years and have had no problems with the unit or with nextel's service. to simplify your reading here is a list of pros and cons. cons: a little chunky; lacks up to date features and tech (such as color screen external display etc.); battery life is nothing to write home about. pros: durability (been dropped off a roof still going strong); looks (yellow model); call quality is excellent; good speakerphone; digital 2-way is a great feature. overall i am very satisfied with my i530. the only issue among the cons that is of any real concern is the battery life but this is characteristic of most nextel phones - perhaps due to the nature of the iden network on which they operate. even after two years my original battery lasts more than a day with moderate use. a pain? slightly but given the advantages of nextel its worth remembering to charge up more often. please beware of several overly negative reviews on nextel posted below - my experience with their coverage customer service etc. has been very positive. just make sure you do your homework with respect to coverage before you sign up with any wireless company. go with the one that gives the best coverage in the areas in which you live work or travel. it's always best to actually put the printed coverage maps to the test with a real phone. some providers are overly optimistic. nextel's maps are pretty legit at least as far as i have discovered ",positive
" for two years now i have not had any problems with my motorola i530 cell phone which is serviced by telus-nextel. over all i would rate the service as good not excellent. rarely i will have trouble getting service in a area where i would normally get a strong signal. this problem will normally last for roughly under a minute before my phone is once again operational. i'm a daily commuter between canada and the united states. my phone doesn't miss a beat it will automatically switch from telus a canadian server to nextel an american server and still have the same great reception. the cell phone itself is big bulky heavy and ugly. it does not come equipped with any of the cool picture or video features. it does have a direct connect feature so you can use your phone like a walky-talky when talking to a friend with the same option on their phone. that is neat and fun. the reception on the phone is clear and crisp it will seldom cut out of the conversation. therefore i did not expect the quality of the sound of down loaded music to be so poor. what is most impressive is the phones durability. this cell phone can really take a beating. i have dropped my phone numerous times. i have thrown my phone across a room to a friend who failed to catch it more then once. one of those fancy little phones would have smashed into a million peaces. on a road trip my phone had fallen off my lap out of the car and sat on the side of the road for three days in the rain. i finally backtracked and relocated my phone. i had recharged the phone and it worked as expected. my phone has never let me down i have always gotten service and the battery has not died on me thus far. the battery when fully charged will last for about thirty hours in low to moderate usage. if you are looking for a quality phone built to with stand punishment and do not desire all of those new phone gimmicks this phone is for you.

" i have this nextel it works verry good im verry happy with it ",positive
" what can i say? it works very well - i keep this in my car so when i travel i don't have to worry about my palm tx's batteries ",positive
" this is the 5th palm treo case i have bought in the last few years and it is the best by far. it holds the treo snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap. the clip is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot. it is slim and works great ",positive
" i'm very happy with this case. i was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my treo 700p but would allow complete access to the treo when i wanted to use it. in other words i didn't want something that was attached to the treo permanently. this did the trick. it's simple but looks good. seems to be solidly made as well ",positive
" great phone ... durable and so far dependable. i did buy a larger battery. there is one complaint sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk. i don't know if it is the service or the phone ",positive
" i have the i850 but the i560 is what my wife has been using for about 3 months. the phone is so good my 2 year old can't destroy it! (he's tried) there's only 3 things i don't like about it: it doesn't have a very big screen the external screen isn't color and it has no camera. other than that it's pretty much the same as the higher priced models like the i850... and holding them together i suspect that they in fact have the same electronics inside minus the 3 things i mentioned above. if you don't take pic's this really is the phone for you! you can even submerge this thing in water and it will still work without needing anything special! it has gps built in and all the java apps. it's everything the higher priced models have minus the camera and a smaller screen. even though the screen is smaller it's color and very legible ",positive
" the motorola i560 is nicely sized easy to use and indestructible. these features are what to look for when looking for a new cell phone. not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky nextel or sprint phones such as the i710 but it is the unbreakable model with outside display. this is something new for the unbreakable model. size is important especially with nextel because most of their early models are very big and awkward like the i710. the i560 is perfectly in between massive and tiny. this is nice because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas. it is equipped with gripping as well which helps when it comes to using the direct connect placing calls and receiving calls. the i710 has a very smooth exterior. it is nice looking but is harder to keep in your hand. more damage is done to the i710 because there is no gripping. if however the i560 does slip out of your hands don't worry. dropping this phone is not a concern due to extreme durability. if you are worried about scratching the outside get a leather or plastic cover for it. the ease of use between the i560 and the i710 is close because they have very similar menu options and simplicity; however the big difference is in the outside display on the i560. without even opening the phone you can place a call by pushing the stop butt at the top of the phone and scroll through your most recent calls. this is a safe feature to use in the car. speaker phone clarity improved for the i560. the i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word where as the i560 is still not perfect in that aspect but an improvement is better than nothing. durability for a cell phone is essential. there is nothing worse than having to take a cell phone in for repair or even worse having to replace it. as much use as most people get out of their cell phones how it stands up to daily wear and tear is vital to satisfaction with a phone. the i560 is one of the unbreakable models from nextel and is exceptionally tough. when the i710 is dropped it often goes to a blank screen and causes problems with reception and service. the i560 is completely opposite. overall performance mass and resilience of the i560 surpasses the i710. when compared the i560 is a better choice. ",positive
" my previous phone was the motorola v60i with a monochrome screen with cingular so i am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do. here's a breakdown of the pros and cons so far (after a week). pros (in order of coolness best first): 1. nextel's direct connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear. 2. any call either directconnect or regular call can be made with the flip open or closed. you can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them. 3. if you're concerned about radio (rf) radiation - and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you (and improves the transmission). 4. the speakerphone is as loud as you need it to be even at dinning room table with the tv on and the sound patched through the stereo system (very impressive). there is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone (full duplex). you can also turn its volume down to a whisper if you want to. 5. the phone is a little wider than some phones (like the v60) but is very light. yet the phone meets the tough military specs. 6. rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my medium-sized hand. phone has slight hourglass shape (wider at the bottom) to fit nicely into the hand. 7. charger charges the battery fast...much faster than my v60 ever charged. 8. phone has all the standard stuff i love and couldn't live without: voice dialing custom rings for calls from my contact list handsfree long recent calls list (up to 20) ability to store number to contacts from recent calls (without having to key the number just have to enter the name). cons (in order of annoyance worst first): 1. the phone is almost completely made of plastic and i've never thought plastic was as durable as metal. while motorola makes truly awesome phones i worry there might be an over-reliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone. 2. when the phone is in the holster the outside display is not visible forcing me to remove the phone from the holster to see who's calling (for those that don't have a custom ring configured) or to check the time. very annoying as i'm used to using my phone as a watch. 3. the icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeing and interpreting the icons. the only two parts that are clear: the battery (important) and date/time. 4. the flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone (where you connect the charger etc) make me think that someday i'm going to look down there and find it missing. it's easy enough to pop off but sometimes takes persuading to put back and have it cover the slot completely (because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec). overall i really like the phone and highly recommend it to all ",positive
" the cover design is well made based on the requirements. the problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the lcd screen because of the openings on both the sides. in my opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the blackberry out of the case ",positive
" i've had the battery for about a week now. simply love it. i'm a heavy user of gps applications and power vision for web-surfing on the go. i used to charge the phone twice a day now i charge it once a day and sometimes i even forget to plug it in at night and i still have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day. even when i forget to charge it hasn't died on me. this is a great deal at $16 + shipping vs. the one sold at sprint stores for around $60 ",positive
" i'm very happy with this purchase overall. this battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone. talk time and internet time are increased greatly. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast. though that is still better than the original battery. it may just be the phone. i have no idea if it is as good as the one sprint sells for 60 dollars. it is definitely worth 20 bucks all day long ",positive

" going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my a900 making it less high-maintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing headset using and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the oem battery decides to die at the most inopportune time. quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind. it's been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars. what!? aside from the piddling cost of this battery (which is about double the tax you'd pay on a battery at a sprint dealership) there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside. to me this is not insignificant but is ignorable as it doesn't detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing talking or using the buttons ",positive
" the only complaint i had about my a900 was the battery life. i am on conference calls a lot and use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly. with this extended battery i am able to use my headset without having to charge the phone repeatedly. totally worth the $15 plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping ",positive
" the samsung a900 is a great phone - a motorola razr on steroids. (that is it's much more durable than the razr.) but the battery life is awful!!! you literally have to charge this phone at least two times per day to get any real talk time. not any more! the bargaincell price was so low i was skeptical. perish the thought! i got the battery on time; it was very well packaged. it fit the phone perfectly as did the cover it came with. i plugged it in and let it charge completely. i then used the phone for three days without a recharge! whoo hoo!!!! bravo bargaincell! by the way - even though this is a somewhat thick battery it is surprisingly unobtrusive: it does not add the bulk you might think looking at its picture. in fact i think the phone actually looks better with the larger battery. i have a leather bytech carry case designed for the razr/a900. it's a tight fit now but i'm sure the case will stretch much like a new shoe does after it's been worn a few days. do not hesitate to buy one of these batteries!! ",positive
" the samsung a900 blade is an excellent phone. i can say so many good things about it. the only bad thing about it i encountered is the horrid battery life. and the battery life was a problem from the second i walked out of sprint. nobody wants to charge their phone between 2-4 times a day. with the standard battery in the a900 i was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times. but that's what you get with a razor thin phone. so of course i searched and finally found this battery which was crucial. this battery is a life saver. be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest i found and i did extensive searching. also this one comes with the door which is very crucial. i've seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and i almost made the mistake of buying one without the door. you would be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery. what would you do put a rubber band around it? heck no. well anyway now that i have this battery my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries. my a-900 is still very thin even with this extended battery that sticks out a little. don't worry you're phone will still look great with this battery and you will enjoy all it's features without dying ",positive
" i initially had the same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained aboutuntil i applied the fix: palm has identified that the treo 680 device can experience reduced battery life when the camera is used. the camera may continue to draw power from the battery when the device is in standby mode. treo 680 users should install the treo 680 camera update to address this issue.[...

" i have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months (including cingular htc 8125 and nokia e62) and can safely say that this is the best phone i have owned. the palm operating system is much easier to use than the windows operating system ( albeit less powerful) and much more customizable and synchronization-friendly than the symbian os. its great for easy installation of software. pros: - very customizable interface making the phone very user friendly. you can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button. - palm os is easy to use and thus you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone unlike windows mobile which is definantly more powerful than palm os but cumbersome and difficult to use at times. - you can use this as a one handed phone...very important for people like me who like to drive and text/email. - perfect size weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear. the lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement. - easy synchronization with your outlook mailbox or with the palm desktop - can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you which is very useful (although limits battery life) cons: - battery life is somewhat worse than other phones. i have to charge my phone every night and i probably use about 15 minutes of internet 30 minutes of mp3 player autoretrieve email every 30 min and 2 hour talk time as well as some other palm functions. if you have it set on auto-retrieve for your email the battery life seems to decrease impressively. the newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently. - you cant plug in your own headsets into the device ( like your ipod headphones) you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from palm. i hate that. i suggest buying this phone unlocked from palm instead of from cingular. i got it for 350$ with a 1g sd card and stereo headphones included. also if you get it from cingular they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone. overall: extremely satisfied with this easy to use highly customizable powerful smartphone despite a somewhat shorter battery life.

" i had a palm tx which i loved but didn't like having to go to wifi sites for the web. i also had a moto v557 phone which is the best cell phone i've ever owned. i purchased the treo for the best of both worlds. i like the treo 680 but i had to read all of the instructions call customer service and practice using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone. for example i had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button. (which i usually missed while in a rush to answer the phone.) i like the web because it's fast enough that i don't miss the wifi. i had to get used to the fact that many web sites aren't small enough for the phone but it's excellent for using google maps looking up business and giving the number for easy dial (just tap the blue line) checking bank accounts online orders movies weather and especially the news. email is good too with the palm software. i didn't use express or getgood email. i absolutely love the chat setting on the messaging. now the phone is another story. i miss the ease of dialing a traditional cell. my bluetooth does not work well with the 680. people typically tell me that they can't hear me so i now use a corded ear bud. the bluetooth doesn't work with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately. you can't insert hard pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions. there is no way to delete one digit at a time if you misdial a number. you have to leave the phone dialing page and return to redial. the phone dials slowly if there are other programs running. and lastly you can't check your calendar or other features after answering the phone if the key pad was locked when you answered the phone. you have to hang up with the person unlock the phone check the calendar and call them back. the battery life is poor but i keep a charger in the car which helps a great deal. all in all i love my treo 680. i have purchased additional software that i strongly recommend. they are: launcher x(excellent) mobil write treo voice dialing the oxford dictionary and thesaurus scrabble and mars needs cows. i also recommend that you keep you treo locked with a security password. i have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this $400 phone ",positive
" when i first got my phone i was quite excited. it had more memory than my current treo 650 however only after one day i noticed the battery life was draining much faster than i had anticipated. from my research i discovered a few things that needed to be done before i extend my battery life to more than 10 hours. 1)i had to apply a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to jan 18th. this patch can be found on palm support site. 2) i needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours. once i did these two things my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge and i've set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive. this is a big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive. i've had no problems with any of my sd cards or mini-sd cards. the increase internal memory also helps since i use my tomtom navigation with my treo. i've heard the various complaints but you have to work through some of them. it is a great phone ",positive
" upgrading from the treo 650 it is true that there isn't much new. also issues such as the horrible battery duration and non-megapixel camera leave one frustrated. but the fact remains that the treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market particularly if you want good pda functionality or are a palmos devotee. so i accept the current palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries. not elegant but it works. that doesn't mean that i won't tell palm guys get your act together and come out with something far better!

" i needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving i do in traffic but i didn't want to look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear. i took a chance on this headset even though i read a review saying that it didn't sync up well with the vx8300. i couldn't be more happy. even though it is small(about 1-1/2) the buttons are still large enough to use with ease. it also fits snug and comfortabe in my ear and works well with my vx8300.

" the headset is great works really well with my samsung phone...the only problem i have with it is sometimes its hard to make it stay in my ear but its really great and i would buy it agai ",positive
" well i read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here but i decided to take the plunge and go for it. well i'm glad i did. all i can say is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the get-go. it has its flaws but what phone doesn't? the question is whether you're going go flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you. most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me. let's talk about the pros and cons: pros: 1. call quality is excellent. no static what so ever. no dropped calls. my area has good t-mobile coverage so i can't complain. as a phone it does what it's supposed to do. make good quality calls. it also pairs with my bluetooth headset (plantronics 510) really well. speaker phone is of good quality too. 2. internet works great. i have the $5.99 plan and yes edge isn't the fastest but it gets the job done. it doesn't matter where i'm at i can check my email finds restaurants or directions or just surf the web when i'm bored. it really came in handy when i was out on vacation and lost. wifi works well too. didn't want to fork out the money for hotspots though. 3. the camera at 1.3 megapixels is decent quality. no it's not going to replace my regular camera but i found it really handy when i forgot to take my camera to my friend's wedding but was still able to take quality pictures. i haven't tried videos yet though. 4. mp3/video player: now the speakers on this phone aren't the greatest so i wouldn't use them for listening to music but when plugged into a headset it sounds pretty good. i bought a 2gb microsd card bought here at amazon and now i can hold a ton music and movies. videos looks pretty nice i'd have to admit. this thing is my travelinig entertainment center. i even found a way to play original nintendo games on this thing and have been trying mike tyson's punchout like back in the old days. 5. calendar/schedule: i had a pda but for some reason i'm more compelled to actually use my calendar and keep my schedule on this thing than i did with my pocket pc. probably because of convenience reasons. 6. smartphone applications: i'm in the medical field and i keep all my medical applications on this phone. i can quickly look up drug references or research diseases. i really thought i'd need a touchscreen in order to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus i don't find that it's all that necessary and still navigate pretty well. i just wish the processor were slightly faster for some of these apps but it's more than adequate. and i'm not sure why people don't think there are a lot of programs for the smartphone. programs written for wm5 are compatable with ppc as well as smartphones equally. [...]. 7. appearance: everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks and so do i. it looks great and feels great. i saw this side by side with the motorola q and the q just looked so much bulkier and...well... not as nice. the rubber backing feels awesome. 8. battery: for all that i use this phone for it makes it through the day with plenty battery to spare which is all i can really ask for. i wouldn't go 2 days without charging the battery though. you should charge it every night. cons: 1. windows mobile 5: mighty microsoft needs to write a cleaner program. however windows mobile 6 is on the way and will be free to download for t-mobile customer soon so hopefully that'll take care of some of the problems. i swear just to turn on the bluetooth and pair up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigate wm5. 2. volume strip: yeah like everyone says it sucks. i disabled mine. adjusting the volume with this thing is tedious at best. luckily my music/video programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volume so it's not such an issue for me. 3. alarm clock: now i don't use this all that much but i see what everyone says about it and yeah it's a pretty idiotic written program. however rather than writing half a page on how bad it is i downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my life now goes on. summary: so i use this device to make quality phone calls surf the web check email play games listen to music watch movies monitor my schedule check my medical references and take decent quality pictures. all this thing needs now is a laser beam that will cut through metal and it'd be the greatest gadget known to man ",positive
" i was carrying a pda and a razr cell phone. when i got this phone i gave my pda to my brother and my razr to my daughter. i love the full contact list with addresses all the phone numbers and notes that are in my outlook and it syncs with outlook. the calendar is really nice and that too syncs with outlook. i don't try to use it for browsing the internet but i do use t-mobiles t-zones to collect all my email from all my various email address types. it took some learning to find the easiest way to get to everything but it's there is you look called and received numbers with one key press extremely easy contact look up and my favorite applications stay on the screen so that they are only a push or two away. it has everything that any cell phone has and works as well or better and easier. the speaker phone is great and one touch (or speed) dialing is great. i can store hundreds of phone numbers at numbers i choose then use the spot number to make a call instead of looking up numbers (ie: lee's cell is spot 5 home spot 15 office spot 25) i found a message board especially for the dash and that helped me learn a lot about the phone. coverage with t-mobile is as good as any. some areas i have service where friends with other providers don't and some areas they have service i don't. all in all i find that i have service across the country without much trouble and i drive. if you have t-mobile cell service their t-zones for email and many other internet based services is only $5 and wifi service is only $20 (monthly) can't beat that. the full keyboard makes text messaging and keeping notes much easier and more fun. it's not a full pda but it does everything i did with my pda. it's way more than a phone really small and thin easy to carry easy to lock and unlock the keyboard. it takes nice pictures for emergencies if i don't have my camera and it uses a mini sd card which i have installed and use to store pictures and videos. personally i can't think of a negative thing about it. it's not a laptop computer but i think it's the best cell phone on the market. my cousin has the blackberry and he's jealous of me and my dash ",positive
" i've had multiple pda's that have crashed and multiple phones in the past. i had a great nokia phone but wanted to combine into one unit so i decided to try the dash about 6 months ago. so far i've had no issues with service. been able to make and receive phone calls call clarity is excellent and with tmobile i have service in my office unlike other co-workers phones. everyone is jealous - their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking. i really enjoy having the email and internet feature. the only issue i've had at all is with the volume control - when i'm surfing the net or playing ball breaker i hold the phone and often hit the volume control. everything else works as described and i'm very happy with my choice. when i was looking to combine my phones i was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews i picked this one. i'm very happy i did. [... ",positive
" this is my first smartphone and i've had a lot of fun with it so far. for being so small the keys are remarkably easy to use. i often connect it to my laptop via a usb cable. if you have windows xp along with ms activesync 4.2.0 your pc/laptop will recognize it as a network device. a little bonus app on the dash lets you share the internet connection (granted you have the data plan) at no extra cost. if you get the add-on micro sd card (about $80) you'll have no need to buy an ipod. windows media player (which comes standard) works just as well. it has a built in 802.11b (or g?) card. when i'm in range of wi-fi i can use skype and save my minutes. i hope t-mobile doesn't read this since they'll probably patch that loophole :) a few of the cons: -there is no scroll wheel like on the blackberry. -the battery charge doesn't last longer than a day or so if you've got data push to outlook enabled. if i forget to charge it at night i'm sol. -the volume strip on the righthand side drives me nuts. i'm constantly hitting it by mistake. when i do an annoying popup interrupts whatever i'm doing. you can disable the volume strip but it's kindof important for certain apps like skype and windows media player. a simple classic volume dial on the side would be a huge improvement. the strip never seems to work right when i really intend to adjust the volume. -the keyboard is nice but a touch screen would be better for certain apps. there's no way to cut-and-paste ",positive
" i have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable. i put a 1 gig memory card in it. right now i have a 140000 word dictionary on it the niv bible star wars many videos of my son about 100 wma songs and a ton of pictures. it syncs up to ms outlook like a charm so all of my contacts appts tasks and emails are always up to date. it comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset. it also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy. the screen is absolutely gorgeous. the camera takes decent pictures and video. one of the best features is the battery life. for all it does it lasts an incredibly long time. i have not found a smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price. i like it waaaay better than the treo blackberries q or any other qwerty device. it's glued to my hip and i use it all the time. i love it!!

" after trying this phone out a few days here are my personal results pros 1. what attracted me to this phone were the fitness features flip phone design and the rugged design. so far i like the pedometer/running tools. you have to calibrate it manually if you want the best results but right out of the box it's been okay so far. 2. i've had other mp3 cell phones (lg vx8500 chocolate samsung sch-a930 motorola slvr l7) and this one blows all of the others out in this category. granted this is not going to contend with the ipod but for a cell phone the walkman abilities are impressive. 3. user interface. by far the cleanest and most intuitive i've used. but then i guess almost anything is an upgrade over the verizon os. cons 1. i can't stand the armband that came with this. the length of the headphones cord is way too long for running at least for me personally. it's taken me a few times to figure out something comfortable in terms of cord management. 2. button layout. my hands aren't big by any means but i still have trouble with some of the dedicated buttons (walkman internet shortcuts power on/off). 3. 2 megapixel camera. i said i don't use the camera feature often and i'm glad i don't for this camera. this has the be the most stripped down barebones 2 megapixel camera i have used. overall i must say that i am satisfied with my purchase; i'm still tyring to figure out some of the features on this phone. i had the choice between this and the w810i for the same price at the sony store and i opted for this one because of the flip phone style and fitness features and i must say that these two features haven't let me down yet otherwise i would've gone for the w810 ",positive
" so i welcome myself to the more powerful world of the cell phones. i've been a fan of sony ericsson's phones after i've seen what they really do and when i had the z500a long time back when i won the phone during hurricane season i thought the phone was great. my only thoughts were that despite the phone being a flip phone and having a music player that the phone only had 15mb of space to begin with and to top it off its camera wasn't great. thanks sony for your answer. i have already made a few quick station buttons on the w710 and the best part is that i feel original with the fact that i'm the only one that has it in my school and among my friends. most people i've seen the only chance they have is getting the w810 and while that phone looks ok the w710 just fits me right. the phone's color scheme the style of the phone the phone's technogeekness (for those of us who love technology) and the fact that many people (namely the girls) find it a cute phone (don't know weather that is good or not but at least it attracts some attention). the fact that the phone's user interface is for the most part the same as every phone from se it makes it that much easier to learn the phone's buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old z500. with 2gb of expanded memory that i put in it and the phone's already 17mb of internal space the phone has many possibilities! and the last part before i go is that with the fact its an active phone you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day check your training and more! it even gives you rewards for being active. so for those needing a nice looking phone want walkman power for mp3's and fm radio knowing your fitness activity this is the phone for you ",positive
" note: i am transitioning from using the sony ericsson p910i smartphone so my review is based on how well the w710i's features work in comparison. i purchased this because i go to remote areas and the p910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function. my son's z500 would work in areas my p910i would not. review is based on 1 week of usage. i've also purchased the z710i for my son and will review that one later. strengths: *improved picture quality of 2.0 megapixels vs. 1.3 *excellent voice quality with headsets (wired or bluetooth) *text sms mms *shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your most used features *battery life is outstanding *mp3 player *rss reader *bluetooth synchronization of files *ability to set up phone in non-english languages *ability to buy an international sim card to avoid extra fees *sync cord charges the battery *can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable (if you don't have unlimited internet package be very careful as they charge big $$$) *fm radio - reception is so-so in the downtown area *standard or flight mode option to use while on airplane *edge technology - my p10i did not have this. i can download email extremely quickly now!!! *step counter & calories expended neutral: *the international charger with an adapter for us outlets. it is very wobbly in the outlet. i'll invest in a us version. *inability to sync with any computer using windows vista (i'm sure a workaround is coming) *i haven't used the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounter's accuracy. *others have warned about holdling the phone and interferring with the antenna i haven't had a problem with this. *over-the-ear earbuds don't fall out! weaknesses: *since i have other sony phones i am disappointed that they have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger. translation you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones. *there is no way to charge the phone and use the wired headset. you either listen to the radio or charge the phone. * you can not use the standard over-the-counter headsets because there is no outlet for it. *need to switch settings to view more than one email account *yet another memory card format (micro)another adapter needed *memory card only 512mb (can purchase 1 or 2gb) *picture caller id only works after you open the phone (edit march 212007 - if you have answer on open set) i purchased my w710i from an internet company for $254.00 and it was shipped directly from hong kong in 2 business days. i'm unsure if i can provide their name here. overall: sony has always produced quality products. i love this phone and it is a very good comparison to a smartphone. i do miss using my styllus. if you don't need the bells and whistles of a smartphone go for the z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender. if i could rate it more than 5 stars i would even though i haven't tried all of the features of this phone. buy it without hesitation! addendum march 5 2007 i dropped the phone on a tiled bathroom floor. when it hit the clip battery cover and battery scattered in different directions on the floor. amazingly the phone still operates. the damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone. a mark like that could happen in my purse! i am really impressed now but hope i never do that again!

" i have been using my krzr for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations. i will try to touch on some things not commented about so much in other reviews... music portability awesome. with the cable that came with my girlfriend's v3i i have had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone. there is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may not transfer blah blah blah but there have been only very few songs with any problem. i have transferred 60 songs so far onto a 2gb mico card i bought and it has been great. the krzr has powerful little speakers that put out a great sound volume and quality for the size. playlists will also continue to play when the phone is closed which i found a very nice and convenient touch. i re-upped on an existing cingular contract and i have also noticed increased signal reception which is nothing to sneeze at considering i went from a nokia 7610 to the krzr so i didn't have some pos crap phone prior to the krzr. as with razrs you have to be careful not to hit the internet button (i wish you could lock keys like on nokia) but i found getting the motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that. overall a great phone. i wish motorola provided you with a disk full of programs included with the phone like i was able to get with my nokia 7610 but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phone itself. some have commented on having trouble with the buttons on razrs and krzrs but for an average size guy with average sized hands this has not been a problem at all. so far so very good ",positive

" srudy phone during all scenarios. mp3 player is great no compatibility problems. the software supplied lets you replace your pda with this phone. the camera is more than decent (much like the 1.0-2.0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past) no problems what so ever the design is rather smart and simple without the lack of elegance. the flip-phone factor lets you talk comfortably and safely with the antena safely away form your brain. the surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches. tiny design details that make it a sony product. amazing battery life surprising for an mp3 phone ",positive

" this phone form amazon actully comes with the 64mb version of the memory stick micro(tm) (m2(tm)) not the 512mb one pictured with the phone. it also feels a bit light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand.. almost a hollow feel. but other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2mp camera. it also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated. the antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger. the way the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception...so you just have to remember that when talking to someone. the inside screen is really really bright! i turned it all the way down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell. the radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too especially if you ride the bus and listen to a lot of music ",positive
" this is the 2nd se phone after t637 and this phone is just better using it with t-mobile it works pretty well as phone and modem voice: the strongest part the best sounding phone i ever used in 6 years the speakerphone is ok not so loud reception: another strongest part with t-mobile it can get some weak signal when all other don't get signal at all; however the antenna is located at the top back (where the loop is) touching this part will lose reception operation: typical se style pretty easy for se users 3 dedicated buttons: web messaging task cam: excellent even though it doesn't have auto-focus like k750 and k790 it looks pretty good even it's better than nokia 6270 bt: very easy to use and pair with pc suite installed file transfer and sync is just a piece of cake the transfer speed is 300-400kb this is the maximum of bt 2.0 speed screen: the main screen is pretty bright even i have to set the brightness down animated standby screen is simply cool; external screen however is monochrome (it maybe a plus when using outdoors the main is barely viewable under sunlight) it display info only it's a kinda inconveient when doing self-pic audio player: i seldom use it because it doesn't support ogg vorbis which i mainly use streaming audio supports real only no shoutcast conclusion: this phone is a pretty good phone for the price quad-band is a must for cingular users fast edge modem for web and tethering score: i give it 95/100 there're some cons rare memory card (m2) and it's not hot-pluggable lack of ogg vorbis and shoutcast support no default usb mode (always asks when plug in kinda annoying ",positive

" i like this for more than one reason...so read on reason #1 - it keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring data trust me this helps when you are transferring 1 gb of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone. reason #2 - only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferred so this way you will know before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car. you will have to use windows media player to sync this phone (samsung sync sgh-a707) in order to transfer files. mp3 and wmv/wma formats work with this phone i do not know whether other formats work or not. let me explain in brief how to sync this phone with windows media player. connect one end of the cable to your phone first and the usb end to your computer usb port (preferably usb 2.0). if you have already inserted media card into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open my computer on your computer. now open windows media player you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu. from left to right you will be able to see in this order - now playing library rip burn sync and guide. click on sync. make sure your cell phone is connected now you will see two halves in the same window left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to be transferred and right half is where it goes (your cell phone name apears on the top) usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file this takes a while. also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select samsung media card as the samsung phone option has very limited memory. once you are well versed with what your phone can play i would recommed copying files to your microsd using a usb reader/writer as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer this saves you a chunk of time and battery power.

" many people are having issues with the 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm adapters and treos. this adapter works fine in my treo 650. the plugs fit fine (i got the 2 pack) and i get stereo sound through both headphones. if you do not have headphones with the proper impedance you will not get stereo sound. my crappy panasonic headphones and better sony (isolation) headphones work fine with this adapter. maybe i'm just lucky but for this low price this adapter is fine. if you want sterling sound you shouldn't be listening to mp3 anyway. i can hear the limitations of my files on the treo so it's clearly good enough ",positive
" this is the kind of thing you don't care about unless it malfunctions. i've had no problems at all with it. it seems sturdily built and unlikely to break easily. the right-angle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snap off in the device (a problem with straight plugs). it doesn't seem to have been made as cheaply as possible but instead made well ",positive

" this case is made for an l6. the l2 uses the same case so they both fit within this rubber case. however the keys are laid out differently on the l6 - so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys. i didn't give it a low rating because it's well built and is actually a really great product - just wanted to give other l2 owners a warning. it works well but it's just a little funky on an l2 but totally usable. for the price you just can't beat it - and it's a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket ",positive
" this was better than we thought it would be. even though the keys are covered it is still pretty tactile. would have liked something to protect the screen. overall great protection for the price. looks better in-hand than the pictures on-line ",positive
" after about a year the ear support on this bluetooth headset broke. bad news. good news: it has a 2 year warranty and logitech is replacing it with a mobile traveller model since the mobile freedom is no longer made. contact logitech tech support / audio by phone (can't be done over the web). it's nice to see a company stand behind their products. way to go logitech ",positive
" works great its a bit bigger than some headsets but in this case i feel thats a good thing the microphone does a lot better job filtering out background noise and you don't get a feedback loop where the person you're talking to hears themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker. the only complaint would be i wish the volume went up just a bit more it can be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly. one note to anyone buying one... the hole to plug the charger into is under the thing that holds it onto your ear it rotates out of the way. it took me awhile to find it when i first got it ",positive
" to me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end and are either: a. feedback loop: where the other person hears themself speak b. ambient noise: the other end hears everything around you especially in a car in minimizing these the mobile freedom bluetooth is the best. i've tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voice clarity without extraneous noises. as for me i hear everyone fine on all the headsets but a conversation is a two-way street and if you've ever used a headset i'm sure you're tired of hearing take me off that stupid thing! the negatives with this headset are far outweighed by the call clarity. yes it's big and ugly but your friends will thank you. the other negative to be aware of (although i assume this is more due to the age of my headset as it's only recently started doing this) is that i've found is that after 1 year while the battery still holds a charge well it sometimes drops the link to the phone when i hang up after a call and i can't get it back until i recharge the thing. like i said it's getting a bit old though. overall if i was going to buy a new one i'd get this one. as far as the other 3 tested i'll rank them in order of call quality (best to worst). plantronics discovery 655 (not too bad but hard to keep in your ear) jensen stereo headphones wbb100rx (more for wireless stereo headphones than for calling) motorola hs850 (looks cool but a total piece of garbage) p.s. if you're wondering why i have 4 headsets it's because there's nothing worse than losing the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone. 1 for the car 1 for the home 1 for the... well you get the picture.

" i've had several gens of the candybar blackberries 7100 nice but reception/mike was horrendous 7130 much better finally nailed it. was dubious when i had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky.... but i'll give it the full thumbs up now. slightly smaller than 7130 which oddly does make a difference like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something. makes my partner's treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison. unobtrustive in yr pocket. the pearl trackball is just fine like it better than roller actually. reception mike quality are also good despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130. writing is good too the suretype continuing to be so durn accurate i sometimes forget to check. and hey i like having the camera. so i thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone the one that i just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great.... but actually... i like the pearl better. if you need bulletproof email pda and phone this is yr baby. slightly shorter battery life but hasn't stranded me yet.

" my first blackberry and i love it! i wanted to stop lugging around a phone and a rather heavy dell axim just to have contacts calendar and task-to-do list. i wanted a phone that synched with outlook and was a great phone. the pearl is definitely the best choice. i didn't really care about internet music or camera but the cheapest $30 internet plan from cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly - it's just great! i bought the $40 1gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it. i use the mp3 songs as ringtones and it's great to be able to instantly recognize who's calling from the music. camera is ok - not great but ok and very nice to have for on-the-spot photos that you don't want to lug around the regular digital for. i actually emailed a picture on the spot - very cool. battery life is phenomenal so far. however i'm not a heavy user and i used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day. only cons so far are: 1) getting used to the keypad - believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word. i've followed other folks' advice and don't really look at the words letter by letter - i type a sentence and then look - it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word. still this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry user but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the axim. 2) also having trouble with having to restart if i change a ringtone for someone - i have to reseat the battery to get the change to take effect. hmmm... 3) volume when talking even on speakerphone is average - not terrible but ok. so far my reception is fine. 4) i also wonder how long the track ball will last - i'm not a heavy user and i still use it constantly. i think i'm going to buy the insurance plan just in case. these minor cons are far outweighed by a simply great phone that synchs with outlook and so very much more. bye bye dell axim. it's true what some say - i'm a crackberry because playing with this thing is addictive. i'll update this review again in 3 months or so but i don't anticipate any problems. my only regret is i didn't hold out until a red pearl came in stock at my local cingular kiosk. i would honestly give this phone 4.5 out 5 stars if they let you ",positive
" top line: this is the best blackberry i've ever used and among the best phones i've ever used. i can use it at work and after hours with out compromise in functionality and style/size. i've been (some what grudgingly) using blackberry since the first pager-style 4 line text device and the 8100 is a breakthrough for me. finally i have a corporate device that treats me like a consumer! the good: - great voice dial: particularly if you are a commuter with a headset. no need to record your voice for each address entry- just say who you want to call and it it doesn't understand you it will prompt you for more info. - size and appearance: finally i don't look like a dork talking to something the size of my palm. the phone is as small as many phone-only candy bars. - easy private email set-up (as with all modern blackberries). seems to have some sort of auto set-up for mac mail and gmail others too i imagine - macintosh compatibility: i just bought the missing sync for apple mac os x ($40 usd) to synchronize my address book calendar tasks and notes from my macbook pro. works great! the software provided by rim is not very easy to use. - fantastic screen and innovative outlook today style summery screen for missed calls latest emails etc. look for this feature in one of the alternate themes that ships with the phone. - as others have mentioned the keyboard is very good. coming from a full size bb keyboard i thought i might miss it but the 8100's is a breeze to use. the not as good: - speaker phone is functional and sound quality in general is fine. nothing like my sony ericsson though... - i think i have a minor voice quality issue between the phone and my motorola h700 headset (the best headset i've ever owned). i think that it might be a compatibility issue. - more mac compatibility would be appreciated - like native isync and bluetooth support ",positive
" this is my first blackberry device. in fact this is the first cell phone i've had where i had a data plan setup. i gotta say i'm luving it! my email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on my desktop. the browser is very robust and seems to work great. i've installed a few extra applications (google maps bbweather and yahoo go to name a few) and i haven't had any problems. the applications cover a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful. i still have yet to try the opera browser for the bb. the camera is so clear with and without the flash it's scary. it beats my old cameraphone hands down! i've discovered that the moniker crackberry is so true. i'm just hooked on getting emails surfing the web and listening to some tunes all from the same device at the same time. i've discovered a whole community of simmilar bb addicts and they are really helpful in discovering the ins of this device. the pearl's suretype keyboard learns as i go and words it didn't get right at first it now picks up and selects as i type. i don't even need to censor the typing too often anymore. i stuck with the suretype mode and caught on to it right quick. this may be because i've never used any other type of mobile device keyboard prior to the pearl. the learning curve was but a shallow hill. my only complaints are that the mp3 player will not play through a wireless headset. you can trick it into doing so but normal play is only through the speaker on the device or through the wired headset. also the speakerphone is a bit muffled as the battery cover actually covers up the speaker! now there are after mod kits that have an oem battery cover with a hole for the speakerphone but come on. finally the vibration of the phone is kind of weak. not a big complaint but it bears mentioning. overall this device is great for beginners like myself. i cannot recommend it enough ",positive
" i just recently bought the blackberry pearl and i love the device. its stylish beautiful small and it has some awsome features. however since i bought it from amazon cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number. so i constantly had to call amazon and ask them about my order. then i receive the phone almost a week later than the day i placed my order and as i follow the instructions my phone didn't want to work. so the representatives told me there was something wrong with my sim card... when it wasn't. luckily i called cingular and a very helpful representative helped me set up my account and actually the service when amazon told me there was something wrong with my sim card lol. overall amazon should be more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy. but whatever i love shopping @ amazon and i truly love my phone and i bet you will love it too. :)!!

" i've had this phone for about a week now and i'm glad i waited to post a review because my initial reaction was not very positive. coming from owning a razr and many windows-based devices there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions. also i was not convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type. boy was i wrong about that one. ok so for the review. my motivation for purchasing was primarily to get a phone first with a few bells and whistles for when i just want to play with the device. the pearl fits that bill perfectly. phone quality is excellent. loading ringtones (a pain at first) proved to be relatively easy once i did a little research. ringtones play very loud and clear. the music player is much better than first impressions would lead you to believe. after a few hours of frustration i was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app. again did some research visited a few forums and found out there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize. as an owner of a nano i was disappointed with the interface of the player. but once you go into the menu functions you'll find much more functionality. it's not an ipod but it works as an decent replacement. and if you're not an ipod owner you'll likely have no complaints. sound of tunes is quite nice when using headphones. camera is only so-so but i don't really care about that anyway. must admit that i thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera. the couple of pictures i took were dark and somewhat grainy. part of why i dropped my rating from 5 stars. as far as email i have a bb from work and they won't let me use a non-work issued device to access the network so i have no opinion on email functionality. organizer features (calendar tasks notes etc) seem more than adequate. much better than any of my old pocket pc devices. the only complaints i would have is that there are still 2 basic things that i haven't been able to figure out and while i'm admittingly not a techie these should be pretty basic and intuitive. one i would like to set one of my ringtones as the default ringer. that should be fairly simplistic but i can't figure it out. two i would like to change the order of the icons on some of the themes. again should be pretty basic but no go. almost forgot can't listen to music through bluetooth. not sure why but this is really my only major complaint. only minor complaints. all in all a pretty sweet device. and btw form factor and looks are simply the best out there. i came so close to purchasing the blackjack very happy that i went with the pearl. update - figured out how to set default ringtone and move icons. coming from a windows mobile environment i was expecting something along the lines of: start-programs-etc-etc. everyting in windows takes so many keystroks. with the pearl it was so easy. i was simply expecting it to be much more difficult based on my prior experience. i'm going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of bt stereo. otherwise as close to a perfect device as i've used (and i've used quite a few) ",positive
" this is my first blackberry phone and i must say it's an awesome device! my husband has a blackberry through his work so i got one too. how we can pin each other keep in touch via email etc. while he is away. the pearl has wonderful reception great style great features etc. i highly recommend it ",positive
" i had a palm 650 for two years. it had a few issues but generaly speaking it worked well. unfortunately one of my big concerns was the phone size. when i first bought it i did not think it woud be a big deal. but after having it for a while it felt like i was carring a brick in my packet (if you are an smart phone user then you know what i am talking about.) i wanted to switch phones but all smart phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size. i was debating between a q and a bjack when i discovered the pearl. at first i thought it would not have the same capabilities of a palm q or bjack; but i had it for 3 months now and to tell the truththere is so many advantages on this phone i do not miss my palm at all. the pearl not only does not have the flaws that palm does but also has the same (or more) capabilities and browsing speed. the trackball works way better than a touchscreen. so far i am very happy with my purchase that i am glad i got the pearl and not the q or bjack. the best part is that i finally feel that i am carring a phone and not a brick in my packet. not sure about it? then do not believe me; simply check the reviews of all smarth phones online. you will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually higher grades than most other smart phones ",positive

" i bought this little phone 8 months ago and am truly pleased with it. i don't use it every day or even every week. i got it to keep with me when i'm driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now. it has paid me more in peace of mind than it could ever cost in dollars. what i like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and can be easily tucked inside pockets or small bags. it charges fully in a very short time under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that. it holds that charge for a very long time as i just found out recently. driving to an appointment i was running late and needed to call to let them know. i'd forgotten to recharge the phone for over 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornail. to my delight it turned right on and i made the call with no problems. can't beat that. the virgin prepay plan is perfect for users like me and ends up costing about $6 a month. tell me there's something better and i'll say prove it. i looked long and hard to find the best possibility and this was it. i think it still is. for a nice dependable insurance type phone i couldn't be more pleased and genuinely recommend it.

" this phone is great! it has all the basic features i wanted out of a phone and i was able to fix the low ringtone problem by searching for audiovox 8610 hack over the internet. you can purchase a cable on ebay and d/l some free softwares over the net. then you can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free. of course you have to be computer-savey to do so. so don't do it unless you know what you're doing. the phone allows 20 seconds of mp3 and midi playback for each ringtone. the cool thing is that each ringtone can be attached to a phone number in the phonebook so you know who's calling by the ring. i downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav files from the net and mix 'n match them into an mp3 file for some great ringtones. example: 3 stooges sound + bell ring + whistle + homer doh + wolf howl - all in one 20 second ringtone. i also made some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well. i noticed some songs and sound-effects are louder than others. thus i only keep the loudest ringtone and they're very loud! i only set the sound volume to 3 and i can hear the ring in my pocket and backpack. overall this phone is always on sale at places like target. if you can make your own ringtone and download it into the phone you can have all the free custom ringtones you could ever dream of ",positive
" i have to admit if you want more from prepaid virgin mobile is a rip off. but if you're only going to use your phone once in a while then it's alright. i bought my audiovox about a year or two ago and it was a good investment. sleek phone outer dsiplay the calls were good quality and i never would get dropped calls. furthermore the color display is great and the battery life is amazing. the phone has all the basic features looks great and is practical for anyone who's not looking for anything outrageous like cameras or mp3. i have also say that despite the service vmobile has good phones. but now that i'm needing my phone more and more i'm ready to dump virgin mobile because the whole 25 cents a minute and 10 cents after that is too expensive. i have to agree with the other reviews. and for their new promotions those hardly last and are only for new customers..so much for customer service. the ringtones are a little pricey but still reasonable; test messaging is available at 10 cents good price. if you want to get more features minutes whatever i say look into other prepaid offers like net10 tracphone or t-mobile. you get more prepaid with t-mobile but the phones with good stuff will cost you a bit more ",positive
" hey...im also 14 yrs old and i've owned this phone for about 2 months....i absolutely luv this fone...i originally wanted the tmobile sidekick. but i couldn't switch my carrier and it was waayyy expensive...so i looked for a fone that is great for texting and i wouldnt have to pay alot for texting...and i found this one !!!!...the only thing is it doesn't have an mp3 player nor a camcorder...also it is a bit bulky and it doesn't have as much features as the env...but i have it for what i wanted it for....texting...this fone has instant messaging and multimedia messaging..virgin mobiles service is good but i have to be honest i do not use this fone to talk but only to text...so i can't tell u how the talking service is...my parents totally luv virgin mobile for teens...u don't have to be a teenager to have this fone but this fone is ideal for a text-crazed teenager..buy this fone !!! *** i jus found out that kyocera has a new upcoming fone...its lyke the 2nd version to the switchback...its called the kyocera m1000...so look it up and see wat its about...it looks just lyke the env ",positive
" i bought my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago so i got a good deal on it. well as some have mentioned the phone has shutdown on me only once while i was using the qwerty keyboard. other than that i have had no problems call reception is great. the camera on this phone isn't the greatest but i don't need it to be high end for the basic fun pics i take. if you're looking to get zoom in larger clearer pictures this isn't the phone for you. the camera screens can be a bit confusing but i've learned to deal with it & my pics come out as i like. a strange feature is the speakerphone while it is quite loud & clear kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound. aside from these things i love my switchback. the qwerty keyboard is perfect for txting but may be too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small. as far as plans are concerned i don't have any problems w/ over charges since i have the 18 cents/min plan. it's good to know that the monthly plans aren't recommended though. a bonus to the per minute plans is the sugar mama service where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute video clips. good for purchasing games or ringtones w/o using up your top-up money. and this cell isn't only for the young crowd i'm an over 25 mom. i got this phone b/c other carriers hardly carry qwerty phones & those that do require addt'l internet service plans (like blackberry's black jack & palm treo's). i only wanted to easily send txts & have it in one compact phone. this was ideal for me ",positive
" ok. i can say i have been a realtor a nursean hr person a mom. that means a heavy phone user- since 1990. my first phone was the old motorola brick analog. one of the greatest and biggest phones ever. i remember my first digital phone and first pnone with games. i have had a total of 5 phones motorola nokia ericson panasonic. this kyocera is the best. i don't want a treo palm because i already travel with a lap top. what i want is a text phone that is small and easy to use. this querty key board rocks. the menu is just like a computer and easy to make selections. the more features you need on the phone the more you want a qwerty key board. get this phone and be happy. also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it. very sturdy little phone and the antena is the loop so it won't poke you. comes with a very easy to read guide book so start up is easy. i paid $199 for this phone in my region and it is worth every penny ",positive
" i have a motorola v220 phone and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month. the cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet. it's fairly light weight and made of plastic but seems durable enough. a small red led lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet regardless of whether you're charging your phone or not. i debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price ",positive
" i purchase this phone for both my wife and i and we both love them. windows mobile 5 takes a little time to learn to navigate but is very versatile and functional. reception and call quality are great and pairing with a bluetooth headset was quick and painless. the screen is bright and crisp. there is no 3g in my area but edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple web browsing. media player works well. battery life is good with 3g turned off. this phone comes with both a standard and extended battery. with pretty heavy usage i still have 1/2 battery power at night. 3g is said to really suck the power though. lots and lots of 3rd party software available to make this phone do pretty much whatever you want ",positive
" i've been using my blackjack for about 3 months now and i love it. sure there are things i would change but the blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes. cons: * the keyboard buttons are really small but then i'm not sure how you could fit all of them on the phone if they were bigger. and i wouldn't want the phone to get any bigger. * if you ever see an ad that has a number like this - 1-800-big-deal good luck on figuring out the alpha-to-numeric translation. haha. i had that issue not long ago. however i think all smartphones have that issue. * lacks voice dialing via bluetooth headset. this one is big for me. i upgraded to the bj from a razr and really miss this feature. pros: the list would be too long if i mentioned all the great features about this phone. so here are a few: * browser support is awesome! i can view everything even flash apps! * vpn support. if you are corporate 'nuff said. this rocks. * easy bluetooth setup and management. * perfect size for a smartphone. not too wide and very thin. * glass screen (doesn't scratch) and screen resolution is unbelievable. * quick toggle scroll button on side is a life saver. * extended life battery comes with the phone. * easy side access to sd card. no having to slide the battery off to remove or replace. there are a ton of great things about this phone. i hear the iphone is supposed to be the real deal but until i see for myself i'm sticking with this beauty. buy one. you won't be sorry. i got mine for $75 with a $75 rebate. free? can't go wrong which ever way you look at it. :) ",positive
" this phone is a great corporate phone. it is the best windows mobile phone currently available in my oppinion. they overlooked a few features: -there is no lcd light to tell you its charging status - instead the screen has to be on all the time. -there is no way to know when the num lock key is on - so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up. -in order to unlock the phone you have to press the on/off button at the top of the phone which is not in a very convenient location. -the track wheel feels pretty cheep ",positive
" this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality. syncs to windows pc and ms office with ease. great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery. having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer. not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome. nice to see this feature return. when cellphone first came out this was a standard feature then it was optional then it was gone. get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or mp3 music player. video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating. many videos will convert and then not display. music is no problem. any mp3 or ms windows media player audio format will play. convert is easy with windows media player 10 or 11. sorry win2k users (forget nt or win9x or me) video conversion is not available on any ms os older than xp and windows media player 10 and 11 are only on xp. get a microsd card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there. pictures can also be stored on the sd card or in the 64megs of internal memory. since this is a ms smartphone there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone. be aware of the aspect ratio this is a landscape display and not portrait. if you get games or applications for it be sure of the aspect ratio. this is a 240h by 320w display. size your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness. the thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing. niggles: 1. camera is slow and not very clear but none of the camera phones i have seen are very good either. 2. need more ring tones. the ones that come with this phone are lame at best. download or create some of your own. 3. need more menu choices. the ones that come with it are ok but take some navigation to get around. 4. hate the cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service (but that is not the phone's fault so maybe i should not list this complaint) ",positive

" i used the seidio rubberized case before this. it is thinner and the pearl is barely noticed in a pocket. this case is about 1/2 inch wider and thicker but it protects the phone on all sides except the top. the phone slips in and out effortlessly. it looks great and the magnet puts it to sleep which is nice. even though it is a bit more bulky i can't go back to the seidio because of the protection and looks. i just use a screen protector but many use best skins ever with it no problem. it's also pretty cheap ($15). less than the seidio and other pouches out there.

" the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be. it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i couldn't be happier. i am going to buy another in a different color ",positive
" this is a great skin for a treo 700. i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that. as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases etc). but the thickness gains you considerable protection. i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch. i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type. the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press. ",positive
" the protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (gps car holder) but does do what is was designed to do. solid grip and non-slip. would be nice if it was not so thick ",positive
" i use this all of the time. it gives good protection ease of use and good handling. only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock. however this is true of any protective skin. outstanding product. ",positive
" overall i'm happy with the skin. it fits the treo 700 very closely. this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo. my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. the 700w and p if you don't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes. well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p. not a huge deal just a slight annoyance. i'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow ",positive

" this is a great cover to the sansa mp3 player. it is heavy duty rubber that is thin where it can be and thicker in all the necessary places. it has a hard plastic screen shield that protects the sansa screen from scratching or shattering. you'd be silly not to purchase this $20 case to protect your $150+ investment. the one downside i can forsee is that the cover is too thick at the bottom to allow the player to sit in most cradles docks or speakers. it is not difficult to put the case on but it would be frustrating to take it on and off often. just something to consider if you see yourself using the player in docks or speakers often. the standard usb cable that come with the product works great with the toughskin on ",positive
" i gave this four stars because the `jacket' adds significant bulk and weight to the sansa product. what was once a slim sleek product is now a rather large rubberized item. on the plus side this jacket definitely protects the mp3; it is very solid and covers the item completely and securely. they included a belt clip and a screen cover that is very hard and will not be easily scratched. the buttons around the wheel are far easier to press now. i wish there were other color choices but over all i'm very pleased with the product. before it was covered i was reluctant to put in my purse or pocket for fear of breakage and scratches to the screen but now i feel very safe carrying the sansa and taking it anywhere i go. highly recommended product ",positive
" the sansa e200 is good for all of the things it will do considering it is only a flash memory based player similar to the ipod nano. unlike the nano it will play video and comes with its own video conversion software. further unlike the nano the sansa has a built in fm tuner and fm recorder which can be nice. finally the sansa has a voice recorder which i do not have a personal use for but just goes to show how feature rich this mp3 player is. on the negative side: the sansa which will accept upto a 2gig microsd memory card but turns on slowly when a memory card is placed in the expansion slot. i like to listen to audio books and the sansa does not have the ability to bookmark. this makes listening to audio books very difficult. overall the sansa is a very feature rich player with a great battery life with only a few shortcomings ",positive
" i bought this case for use at work. i work in a semi-dusty shop environment. i'm always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well. i don't have to worry about the screen getting scratched (the screen on the sansa e2oo series scratches very easily) with the hard plastic screen protector. i am very pleased with the speck toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and co-workers. ",positive
" while i thankfully haven't had to test the protective qualities of this product it appears it will do the job nicely. the only thing i would change is to give it a fixed belt clip ",positive
" great case protects my sansa well even makes the buttons easier to push. decent sansa products are hard to find thank you speck ",positive
" great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa user. strong and looks good. it even comes with a clear plastic screen saver. i am very happy with this product ",positive
" this is a must for anyone that is 'mobile'. i am never home. always at starbucks or libraries studying and this added safety is necessary to protecting the player ",positive
" i really like this protective cover. it is very well made and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the sansa even from a fall. the funny thing is that now that it is in the toughskin i am much less likely to drop it. before i bought the toughskin the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped. now that it is in the case it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressure. it is true that the buttons are easier to push with the toughskin on than it was without it. the hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well. the only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than i would expect. overall this is an excellent product that i would not hesitate to recommend ",positive
" this cover is the best you can get for your sansa e series player. it increases the size a little but the durability is worth it. the belt clip is great cause i use mine at the gym too. i purchased an armband but this is much better. it also comes with a display cover that i have discovered is a necessary item my display began to show minor scratches after only a couple of weeks use so if you don't buy this at least get the little expensive stick on covers. the toughskin also makes the function buttons work a little easier. the small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the micro-sd slot without removing the sansa but that is only a small issue. my advice you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3 player so spend a little more and protect it the best you can ",positive
" i'm a previous owner of body glove cel phone cases (a moto v810). i purchased this item from amazon a few days ago for my 6255. my cel fits perfectly. the case protects every part of my cel (buttons screens jacks) and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case and looks nice. my next phone will have its body glove case too ",positive
" i got this case/holster a while back after another maker's fell apart in a short time. i was impressed with the reviews i saw here. what i would add is that the case is durable and i am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months ",positive
" this case was a perfect fit for my mot v180 phone. the top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snap together so they stay in place on the phone so it can't easily fall out (a problem that i'd had with a different product). the part that slips over the top of the phone has a built-in see-through window that lines up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case. the quality of construction looks to be pretty good too ",positive
" i was a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone. i wanted a holster that wasn't a sloppy generic model that didn't fit. i was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and i tried it on my motorola v180. it fits like a glove and looks good. no complaints here. so if you have a v180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you that you won't be disappointed. the added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer: ",positive
" this is a great case! i have a motorola v180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didn't line up. because this is a flip phone most cases move when you open and shut the phone covering speakers etc. this case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement when you open and close the phone doesn't affect the placement of the holes etc. in the case. also the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellent. ",positive
" after reading the reviews here of this case i thought i'd take the plunge and try it. the cases i'd seen in stores were fairly cheesey although they were cheaper. this is a wonderful case. the materials are first-rate and the fit is perfect. i highly recommend this case ",positive
" from longviewer's advice i got this case and he was right on!!!! awesome custom fit!! great case for the money thank you !!! gar ",positive
" this is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free motorola v180 - spend the money on this case to protect your phone! i looked at many different cases in stores and online hoping to find something handsome but even more importantly - really protective. the v180 apparently has had a few comments on the home screen going ka-plooky - 'nuf said - i needed a better grade clear interior protector for the screen and touchpad. sydney harbour gets high marks on this feature - not flimsy dull plastic but very clear quality stuff. secondly the super-soft matte black leather is a sweet fit - nice and snug form-fitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching. the cut outs are perfectly lined up too - there is one for the speaker phone feature on the back (not mentioned in the ads). snap on the antenna loop and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feel. sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product - but if you're like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life you try to make smart and carefully considered purchases. be nice to yourself and your phone - go with sydney harbour and avoid the cheaper stuff ",positive
" this device works great. i use it on a usb laptop to charge the treo 650. i also use it on a wall outlet and the car. no problems. the cords retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient. it does not come with a case so you'll use your own bag or whatever. the part that fits into the treo is very secure. it does not pop off like other chargers. the only thing i can see that could be a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged ",positive

" i love my blackberry pearl and my swivel case is the icing on the proverbial cake. good quality swivel mechanism that appears to have the potential to last a long time something that prior holsters have failed to do. i also like the magnetic closure which snaps closed securely and quickly once i place my pearl into the case without the need for finding a snap fitting. my older blackberries have had cases which after use had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the two-handed method for nesting my phone one hand to move the flap out of the way and the other to insert the phone into the case. this is a very frustrating occurence since i am usually attempting the more-preferred one-handed approach. although still relatively new my new case appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstruction. before i purchased my leather swivel case i looked at 3rd party generic cases. each of these were unable to notify my blackberry that it was in its holster. with my new swivel case as soon as i insert my pearl the display shuts off thereby extending battery life. in addition this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my bb is holstered or not. also since this is an oem case it was made especially for my pearl. when holsetered both the usb connectorthe earphone outlets and the volume control buttons are all accessible. with non-oem cases in order to use a hands free device or to charge my phone i might have to remove the phone from its case. i am a little disappointed that the pearl came with no case at all. this is probably due to its small size and your ability to just slip the phone into your shirt pocket unlike prior blackberry devices. of course that still exposes the vulnerable display to significant scratch-potential. they should have at least provided a simple pouch which would provide some protection. this of course is a comment on the pearl itself and not the swivel case which is the subject of this review. all-in-all i highly recommend this case for those of you who still wear your phones on your belt ... and since i'm at it i love my pearl ",positive

" i've had a treo 650 for a long time. i wasn't 100% sure i'd want the 680 when it was first announced but a big nasty scratch on my 650's screen helped me decide to take the plunge. i'm so glad i did. the lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better the internal slot for the sim card eliminates my worry that it might get lost and the covered sd card slot is very welcome because the darned thing always popped out in my 650. the only thing lost from the 650 is the reset button. to reset the 680 you have to take out the battery. that's not a big deal since even on the 650 you have to remove the battery cover to get to the reset switch. what's better on the 650? the main thing for me is that the cell phone's radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb sd cards (sdhc). i use this phone for everything since it's also a great palm organizer. in addition to that i've installed a registered version of pocket tunes so it's a very good mp3 player. it's even compatible with playsforsure if you're into that. that's why i'm so happy to see the 8gb support. i also use the phone to play games like monopoly and scrabble when i'm waiting on line or in a boring meeting. i have absolutely zero complaints about this phone.

" believe it or not i consider going from a blackjack to a treo 680 an upgrade. i guess the whole battery problem depends on the usage and the person. my battery problem is that i cant kill the darn thing! i am one of those people that depletes a battery completely before recharging it. i do it to my laptop and my ipod and the pda i had before the blackjack the tungsten 2e. devoted palm users will absolutely dispise the windows mobile 5 available on blackjacks. mainly because you can not create and edit word excel or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on outlook. which i absolutley can not put up with. even the contacts wouldn't backup! needless to say the treo 680 saved me. if you do go the way of the blackjack without outlook look into sbsh's programs facade and papyrus. however if you go with the lovely treo check out dialbyphoto i think the coolest part is how you can set up a favorite 5 like tmobile offers but still have all the reliability of cingular ",positive
" i just go the phone about 3 days ago and i love it. it is my favorite phone i have had to date. some people ask me what can that thing do? and i respond to that what cant it do. this phone can do anything you really want. the features are nicely made to be used. especially since it has a beautiful 2.2 in touchscreen. the display is incredible. i can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do. the last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance ",positive
" the pros: pda good mobile phone that really gets out a camera for all those 'kodak moments' all packed in one for a good price the cons: you'll need to get a replacement longer life battery (seidio makes one) and the browser (blazer) has many problems. i'm very happy with the purchase of this smartphone. i've wanted a treo for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one. you can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software it's a nice little phone. i haven't bought a memory card for it so i can't report on the mp3 capabilities but i am going in that direction. somehow i don't think it will replace my ipod but you never know ",positive
" i've had my treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications i especially love having the goodlink email application my family videos mp3's pics and all my office documents at a touch of a finger. yes the battery life goes quickly but i don't mind charging my treo every night. the slick and slim design is a real eye catcher and feel great in the hand.[...] in the one month of usage my treo has hung one time a simple reset fixed it and hasn't hung since ",positive
" i bought this even though i saw a lot of negative reviews some about battery life some about dropped signals. so far i have had neither. i have owned many palm devices over the years and i will be the first one to say that palm can make lemons and when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later if they ever do. not the most customer-oriented quality-oriented company out there. but their os is still the easiest to use in my mind and with the myriad of apps out there you can make it do whatever you want pretty much. the screen is on the smallish side compared to the tx but it's not that bad especially for a phone. it's pretty reliable and i have put a lot of my old software on it. the battery is what surprised me the most; i was expecting something really bad but so far i have never been under 50% and i am a heavy palm user. i don't use the phone part of it much just a call here and there and i turn the phone function off at night. i also bought kblightsoff which turns off the keyboard lights unless you are using it which probably helps a lot. so with these two settings battery life is close to the tx in my opinion. i have one dead pixel but that can happen to any electronics manufacturer. i don't like the 2.5mm jack at the bottom of the device that's a terrible place to put it. but with an adapter i can use my good headphones and sound is good. get ptunes deluxe so you can use subsription music like napster or yahoo music. i should receive my 8gb sdhc card tomorrow which will turn my treo into an iphone killer imho. and for way less than $599... sound level is ok and you can get software that boosts it up if you're deaf. speaker level is loud! the sms program is great the phone app is great and fast. so overall it's a great device. i wish palm wouldn't charge an arm and a leg for accessories but you don't have to buy from them.. ",positive
" overall i am very happy with this product; it protects the phone without taking away from its beauty nor does it make the phone bulkier. my only compliants are that it does not come with a screen cover and it makes the phone slightly harder to slide open. ",positive
" i think this would work better with a money type clip. however since verizon doesn't carry anything like this in clear this works ",positive

" bought this to replace my three-year-old cell phone and an ancient but still working palm iiic. my observations after 30 days of ownership: 1. setup is time consuming but unavoidable. patience is required. i've had a couple of questions that i asked cingular only to be forwarded to palm only to be forwarded to microsoft then back to cingular. it seems no customer service department has really mastered this unit. 2. have to do a soft reset every once in a while. the unit turns off the sound by itself and the only way i've found to fix it is to do a soft reset. 3. i'm not crazy about microsoft outlook's calendar compared to palm's. i miss several palm features like the go to and the today buttons. outlook's calendar just isn't as easy to manuever as palm's. 4. phone listening volume is low especially when the unit is in a protective case which puts it a little further from your ear. 5. love the bluetooth option. it's new to me and it's just great. 6. love being able to press a picture to make a call. we have five kids; i have each kid's picture linked to their phone number. even my technology-challenged husband can call them by simply pressing their picture. 7. this phone talks! a female voice announces who is calling and when your next appointment is. the first time she spoke it about scared me to death. the voice reminds me of the computer on star trek--but not as clear. however after getting used to her accent she is intelligible which means the computer is translating my written input into spoken words--amazing! 8. the internet connection has limited use for me. i don't need email on the run and i could live without this and the extra monthly cost. most traditional internet web sites take much too long to load and display too small a portion of the page to be useful. it is nice to check the weather or get directions on the go. 9. can't imagine watching a movie or any complex video on this tiny screen. what's the point? 10. splurged on a sweet little vaja leather case that is wonderful. very expensive but a terrific luxury. 11. amazon's prices were the best by far on this product! saved over $300 off my local retail cingular dealer. 12. best part: i no longer have to carry a pda and a cell phone! they are one and the same! 13. conclusion: this phone is very smart and fun to use although it comes with a big learning curve. the low volume issue could be a problem for someone with bad hearing ",positive
" the whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with cingular wireless customer service to port over my number from verizon. the treo 750 was a snap to figure out setting up my email took only a few minutes. i've owned it for three weeks now and i am still discovering great phone/pda features. i bought a 4gb mini sd card (samsung memory) from ebay for $39.99. combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs. i also bought a shure tec3 earbuds for $110. they're about the best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2.5mm jack.

" recently decided to purchase the treo 750 but after ordering amazon sends shipping info and it won't arrive for about a month and a half! i cancelled and went to cingular and purchased for a lesser price and had it in my hands immediately. sad... ",positive
" treo 750 one of the best and coolest phone. i am in love with this phone. because of windows os it is very easy to use and understand functions. slim and light weight. love the touch screen function. i ordered this phone on sunday evening and got it on wednesday amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones. also i ordered two phones (family plan) there was some problem in other phone i requested the replacement and amazon first sent me the replacement of that phone through free 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to return problem phone. i am so impressed with amazon's service ",positive
" i work for an university and my contract was due 2 months ago. i decided to get this phone because my pda was already old and i needed something that would be efficient. i got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and i just have good things to say about it. first it is not as heavy as the last model (650) and also looks really cool. second the interface is pretty easy to use and figure it out. the phone is microsoft os based (i used a palm device before) so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue. the battery works really well and in spite of other reviews the life have been pretty great even when compared with my last phone (a motorola). in general i thinks is a pretty good buy and you cannot beat the price when cingular sells it for way more money than amazon. i'll definetively will buy from this website again ",positive
" i bought my treo 750v a couple of days ago. i got really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported like short time lived batery. the only problem i am facing is with setting my voice mail. the icon shown in the today page does not accept any number i will to attach to it. as a result i was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number. i really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by palm with a downloadable file because except for this problem treo 750 is really great ",positive
" otherwise it would have 5 stars. fits my treo 680 even in the case which is a big plus ",positive
" hiim a satisfied costumer for the motorola i760 phone.before all i had was a phone boothbut now that i got this phone no booth for me and evryone is sayen they want one too so im helpen.thanks for the phone.= ",positive
" my husband uses this phone for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones i've ever heard. i don't know what it's called but it has an upbeat techno rhythm to it. the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time including him. it's great for a business that has many locations. i only give this product four stars because i haven't tried it myself so i don't know all the features. but i hope the review i've provided helps ",positive
" i came over from cingular after trying there ptt just not happening for me and i will leave it at that. i choose this phone because of the large display and the color of the phone overall ( love blue ) i bought this for 110.00 at a corporate store i get a discount for the company i work for. we had a problem with the second one took it back and swapped it for a brand new in the box phone. the clarity and ease of functionality is fantastic you dont have to be a rocket scientist to operate this phone and the gps along with telenav is fantastic we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell tower i can still connect to one another like normal walkie talkie's hey if your going to spend the money do it right the first time. i put the extended battery on mine and i get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge which too me is great. dont change the default times for backlighting thats whats eating the battery time up also dont leave a java application in suspension that will eat the battery up also. buy the data cable and add your own ringtones and backgrounds moto has a phonebook manager package on there site which is free and is so easy to use. for ringtones and wallpapers u can use webjal once again easy to use. i looked at other phones and i dont need cameras in a phone the primary selling feature was the fact of large numbers and ease of use. michae ",positive
" my husband and i just recently upgraded to this phone.we were going to got to the i560 but got a great deal on these. so far so good. i switched from an i730. what a difference! it seems lighter. it fits in my pocket better. the other always came unclipped when i stood up falling to the ground. i like the sound quality better also. the screen is a little bigger than the i730 also. the front screen for caller id seems a little dark and the area to charge it is a little harder to get to(that plastic still gets in the way!) those are the only negatives so far. i really like the buttons on the i760. since my husband is switching from an old i90 he loves it! hope this helps with purchasing. also if you have no service you can use these as walkie talkies. we haven't tried that yet ",positive
" i was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving so i decided to upgrade my phones. (the first 730's speaker grill came off and i tried to glue it back on myself. a word to the wise don't use too much glue.) so i went to nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internet. i didn't need a camera phone since i have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures. one bad thing is that since i changed my phone back in april i couldn't sign back up for two years and get the $150. i could only sign up for a year and i had to pay $275. i don't understand that. but this review is about the phone: cons: super short battery life especially if you have the web. instead of having a separate button for each number key it has three big keys with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys. unfortunately you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center otherwise you'll dial the number above or beneath it. the jury is still out on this one but i'll list it under cons. the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal. pros: huge display a whole lot lighter than the 730 i enjoy the photo caller id. it also shows the photo when you call that person the sleep mode is a good addition. if you don't use the phone for a couple of minutes the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up. the only thing i really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front especially since there were several colors. this phone just blinks a lot to your ring tone in a light blue. oh well. i'll write more the more i explore the phone.

" i really like the javoskin for my treo -- it's well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable. the material is soft to the touch but strong on protection. i don't like the lanyard they send with the product it's about 24 long and reminds me of shoelaces. i prefer a smaller more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist ",positive
" i tripped and basically threw my treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk. with the skin on it no harm done. none. this is the second skin i've owned - the first from javoskin - and i like this one better than the first. the skin is thicker but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use. i didn't like the cord attaching bump on the side at first - but i did attach the cord and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag. i highly recommend this product - whether or not you use the cord ",positive
" the quality of the product is very good... i love the fact that i can now drop without it ending up in 3 pieces on the floor! the only thing i dont like is that its not exactly grey but not quite clear... but who cares its a great product for a great price.. ",positive
" idropped my new phone at the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere - in 3 places.... with this cover it is definatly protected....i don't like the smoke color... but who really cares for the price.. ",positive
" this item works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it doesn't easily clip into the phone you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it ",positive
" this holster provides good protection for the device and has the sturdy swivel clip for your belt. the flap is secured by a magnet making it easy to remove the device. it does just what you want it to do ",positive
" this is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt. my husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks. i would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls ",positive
