" i want to start by saying fred flare- shipped this product very fast!! and the transaction itself was very smooth. i do however have extreme problems with the product itself. the product is not leather its nylon and it sort of looks cheap? the inside material is sued but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. also the wallet part is very hard to use. you cant really put too much in the wallet- the credit card slots are a little too snug and there is no place for my i.d. the wallet included a small note book but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? i was very excited about this product but now i feel duped. the pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality and that it was user friendly but it's not. i do not recommend this product ",negative
" i have to say that i was disappointed when i opened up the package containing my ipod wallet. it's cute but not $60ish cute. first of all it's not leather it's nylon. the lining is indeed suede but the photos in the product listing are misleading. i'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back etc. isn't worth it. it does the job but it wasn't what i was expecting. i feel ripped off ",negative

" if you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you. the white is thin and you can see through it so i don't reccomend buying white on this brand. the t-shirts run very small. a size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small. they are also short. 29 inches is short for a man's t-shirt. if you are tall i would not recommend this t-shirt. the t-shirt is soft not scratchy and the style is nice. we only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through ",negative

" i purchased 3 different embassy purses last december. none of them were the quality i had hoped for and none were used as the gifts they were intended for. in this case the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used. i would not buy from this company again ",negative
" i purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because i have a hard time walking in really high heels. they are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. when i walked around in them i could feel them flopping. also anytime i raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. so just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. for the price this is not worth the buy ",negative

" our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up. he could not wait to get this belt. we had purchased the police uniform earlier. the first time i ordered the belt it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it. when it finally arrived he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long. it is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it. it is less than 4 weeks old and probably won't make it through the rest of the month ",negative

" this pillow is an inflated u that fits around your neck. one of the problems is it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck. this can get pretty irritating the longer you use it. fortunately it is dirt cheap so then i guess you get what you pay for. ",negative
" shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige. which leads you to think the color is mostly white. the true color is neither! there is absolutely no white in these shoes. i purchased these shoes because i needed some white off/white shoes not beige shoes. no i did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so i kept them and i have worn them once but do not like the color at all. the style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain. the materials are an excellent quality. if you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes ",negative
" our company ordered these shirts from the texas shirt company. while we were happy with the quality our order was missing 2 shirts. over a nearly 2 month period we sent emails and called customer service to let them know but their customer service representative insisted that they were accounted for - as if to say we were not telling the truth. if you don't care about customer service then perhaps you might want to use them because the quality and pricing are good - but if you want to be treated fairly then pick another company ",negative
" i purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to japan. however it was way too thin to keep her warm. after using it for about an hour we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline. since i spent over 40 dollars on this blanket i couldn't even throw this away. i had to haul it around for the entire trip. i do not think it is worth 40+ dollars. 10 dollars blanket would do the same (or even better) job than this ",negative
" this was a nightmare order.i paid extra for expedited shipping to assure christmas arrival.package tracking log revealed that the shoes were not even shipped until after christmas -disgraceful and unforgivable to have to tell my 7 yr.old grandson that his gift didn't make it.the shipping cost as much as the shoes and this company should be ashamed.they are also impossible to reach-amazon couldn't even get them on phone.thank goodness the shoes fit-i can't begin to imagine what a return would have been like. the product is great ",negative
" these shoes look great but are horrible running shoes. the soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact. i do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes. they may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them. i returned them and plan to try something else ",negative
" i ordered this wool wrap at the beginning of december and never received the item. i am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me. if people can't be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out. two thumbs down ",negative

" i have ordered intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase. so far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after 4 washings. i will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn. i now know why i pay $15.00 for two pair of jockey's ",negative
" the fabric is a little stiff at first bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. the elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. after a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. while cheap and nicely packaged these things suck. spend some money on decent underwear ",negative
" i received the night gown tried it on and actually hated it. the built in bra was loose as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top. the straps are too wide. the rest of the gown was okay although it too seemed too drapey and long. i sent the gown back 3 weeks ago now and have still not received a refund. i am very disappointed with the whole transaction/product ",negative
" the sizes listed do not print on the invoice. instead army navy uses 'codes.' when they send the wrong sizes then they blame you for not selecting the right size and want a 15% restocking fee plus return shipping ",negative
" quality was terrible undersized or seconds. later i saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1/3 of this price. i would not recommend these to anyone i paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit. amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere. it is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface. i am disgusted with this product ",negative
" the shoes weren't the color that i wanted them to be. to me there cheap and are over priced! the quality is not good. they can easily be scuffed. am definitely returning them!! ",negative
" ...the shoes weren't quite what i thought they would be although for 40 bucks i probably shouldn't have been expecting the highest quality pump. they looked a bit cheap and on top of it all they were too small for me. there was no return slip in the package no number to call no way to send the shoes back to make a return so now i'm stuck with 40 dollar cheap looking shoes that no one but my little neices can fit into--and they're a bit too young to be dressing like ladies of the evening. my fault for buying shoes at a place called hollywood heelz i should have known better. i will say this though i like the thin heel and the shoes came in a timely fashion. if i could fit them i'd give them a 2-2 1/2 for that alone ",negative
" these tops were cute for my 7 & 10 year old neices. how in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things? ",negative
" the material's good but the suit runs way too small. i ordered the appropriate size based on my measurements but all my wobbly bits are poking out. i don't think i could wear this out in public! not for curvy women! ",negative

" not the best fabric scratchy and see thru. you get what you pay for on these ",negative
" i bought these because they cost less than uggs. but there is no comparison. my old uggs ruled were totally comfy and warm. i bought these because i didn't have the money for uggs and they said they were sheepskin. when i recieved them they looked and felt different. the fur was not curly and fluffy like the uggs it was relatively short and not as soft. i called bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic. but after several calls the owner told me they are not 100% sheepskin they are blended with merino wool which is not stated anywhere on amazon or their website. also i am a designer/ decorator and i am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and i still say they're synthetic. i returned them at my cost and am waiting for a refund. you get what you pay for! i probably could have bought a better pair at payless. what happened next: they promised me they would refund my money if i returned the boots at my cost instead they sent them back to me with no refund. nice ",negative
" these socks are okay but after one wash they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good. so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz. also they are too warm socks ",negative
" i received the wrong size and color. i returned the product and was told that a refund would be credited to my account.....i am still waiting.....was told that amazon forbids seller to ship a replacement item ",negative

" i just found out that this shirt back-ordered after i was promised by amazon before i ordered it that i will receive this item before december 23. i just now received notification that this item was shipped on the 24th and i had purchased it on the 15th. this means i will not get it until after december 26th! because i bought this shirt to go with some camo pants for my sister i was only able to give her pants without the shirt for christmas. she had to leave back across country and i am forced to send this shirt to her. how embarressing! obviously it is christmas time and if you're going to have a storefront on amazon.com you better get extra stock! the worse way to keep a happy customer is by backordering on christmas and ruining a family member's present. beware folks you may not get this item when it says you will ",negative
" i actually had to send this back cause of the size. they run really small. ",negative
" these shoes were very cute as i thought they would be from the pictures. but because of the sides being so short they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking especially when going up stairs. i returned them after only wearing them for 1 day.. ",negative
" very poor quality falling apart at the seams. also really long. ",negative
" these shoes are no longer being made in italy but in india. the quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be. i have worn this same style of bostonian (marco) for several years and was completely satisfied. this is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great comfortable well-constructed shoe. return to having them made in italy!

" beware this item is not a zip front hoodie as the item description says. it is a pullover! ",negative
" the other reviewer is spot on. these are pretty (but not truly mirrored) and they broke after only 4 weeks use. i bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price. definitely not worth the $16 ",negative
" they're pretty but flimsy. very light construction. the lens is not really mirrored so if you attempting to hide your eyes forget it. it would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap chinese knock-off. gave them two stars simply because they are good looking but cheap--and they feel that way on your face. ",negative
" i have worn jockeys for almost 20 years but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years. the fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly and the underwear is for some unfathomable reason heavily perfumed! i had to wash them at least 5-6 times to get the smell out. plus some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight and some was so loose i couldn't wear them -- and they were all the same size. very inconsistent quality. i do not recommend these anymore ",negative
" bought one for my new ipod nano a total disappointment. very poorly made. only glued together not stiched upit already started to go apart. you won't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small. plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one's self when walking or working out. it looks pretty but that is all ",negative
" the 2 bras i ordered were they same style it even said so on the labels attached however they both look and feel different. the white has a lot more padding a rounder shape and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design). the navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what i wanted in the first place) i was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition i had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen i was not informed that it would have to be backordered. not happy with my overall experience ",negative
" the one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body...and the item looks made in china if you know what i mean. rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong. they look much classier than the transparent beads with nylon string of the string of bubbles panty ",negative
" all i have had with this product is problems. the clip in the middle kept popping open even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever. don't waste your money ",negative
" these were a gift at christmas and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading and by the 3rd wash i knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore. the silk is soft and lovely but the color should not fade this fast or this much!

" i saw the reviews and ordered the bag the first impression was it looked pretty good! i was happy if i had rated it at that time it would have been 5 stars. the problem now is the threads have come out at couple of places on the front. i had to trim to remove the hanging threads. there are double stitches on the bag. the clip just above the calpack symbol has come out. i suppose the ring which holds it has cracked. don't ask me why i did not send it back... it costs 10 bucks which is one third the price of the bag which does not make sense to send it back. it has started to give me the feeling that there is a price to pay for anything that is cheap! the next time i'm going to branded bags it is worth the price i guess. on the other hand the rest of the bag seems to be ok! except for the defects on the front of the bag(mentioned above). if u r lucky u could have got a better bag ",negative

" i ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and i had the same problem with the turpentine smell. i was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price. i wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem. i washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink. i'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they don't make my other clothes smell and i'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them. ",negative
" even for only $12 these weren't worth the money. they came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine or some other noxious chemical and now at least 2 months since i have received them the smell has not dissipated. they are extremely stiff so even if they didn't reek i still wouldn't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day. i guess that's what i get for buying cheap shoes ",negative

" i bought this as a birthday gift for my husband and while i wasn't expecting the best quality in the world (because of the price) i was still a little disappointed. the company did a wonderful job of packaging/shipping the product-even the buttons were individually protected. i paid for expedited shipping but they still cut the deadline close so i was nervous about it arriving in time. the lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn't as streamlined as the pic implies and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places. (it was lumpy-looking even in the box.) removing the zip-out lining doesn't change this--there's significant padding in the shoulders. it's also a shinier leather than expected. sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate--i ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats (which is a size larger than his regular clothing) but it was still too snug in places lining or not. overall though i'd say i got what i paid for if you don't count the unusually high shipping charges.

" sorry to give such a bad review but i can't in good conscience give a better one. i did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. i am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. there are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. while doing these moves i kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. sure enough by that evening i was dying! perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. i am in good shape and have actually been doing the p90x extreme workouts. i am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do tae kwon do and i do not have any back problems. i snatched this up when i finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. i love all the other firm workouts but will never do this one again. additionally when i received this from amazon the ball was misshapen & the dvd case was broken from the weight of the ball. they immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way ",negative

" be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards. i bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards my id and some cash. hence there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet. from the picture it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. whereas in reality it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders). other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space) the leather itself is very low quality and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it. furthermore on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was made in china. i mean china is great and all but if you're on a date and you say hey let me pay for this and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying made in china well you are pretty much a schmuck (i cut mine out with a pair of scissors but there are still some remnants). so if you like being low class by all means buy this wallet. i personally don't care about my wallet very much so i am keeping it and going to use it but i almost returned it. it is most definitely a solid 2 stars. hope this helps ",negative

" i've been buying land's end sport knit pants for over 15 years (land's end clothing for much longer). they've redesigned these completely (and are doing this to all of their women's pants). don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order. also this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic. ll bean is discontinuing their similar perfect fit pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned. here's just a few of their improvements? among the changes: the waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches. it now rolls! fun - not! next the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches! it was great fun to put on the ones i ordered and even after washing them i thought i must have changed bodies overnight. the waist just hung..... dare i put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down. when i tried walking in them that's exactly what happened and i was constantly having to pull them back up. i had to pin the waist to keep them on... that's not all the changes..... they've enlarged the bottom legs by four (4) inches! no more slightly tapered leg. the front rise has shrunk from 12.5 to 11.5. if i wanted my belly button to show i'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers..... the back rise has increased from 15 to nearly 16 inches. did my rear suddenly increase in size? i think not. they claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz). the ones i am returning are less substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones. next it seems they have also extended the inseam length. it was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after. the ones i received after being washed had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches. finally as if i wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs. do you get the picture? the waist sags and rolls. the seat is major baggy. my belly button shows. they have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch. they are sucked tight to my thighs then ballon out from my knees to the feet. they're too long so you can't even see my feet. i spent 30 minutes on the phone with a specialist at land's end and she couldn't explain why all the changes. that's also where i got all of the above new specs. also spoke with a specialist at ll bean and their new specs are identical. i spend so much each year with land's end that i get a gift and card at chrismas from them. so i'm not a casual purchaser of their product. buyer beware and get the new specs before you buy a product you think you know and can rely on. you cant. if you are a land's end or ll bean customer - call them and complain. they've done this in the past then had to bring back the old version. so it wasn't broke land's end was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) so whose dim-bulb idea was it to fix them????

" i am in great shape. however i cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension. obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches. the idea of medium as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards. my body fat is low. i am not profoundly muscular bound. as is common in men of my age lower back problems are not unusual. i have a 32 waist. is that not medium sized? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether. one size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems. the draw string is fine. it allows flexibility. so what if your pants fall down? it seems to be the fashion anyway. just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary uncontrollable constrictions. also these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing. they looked like crap after the first time i washed them. i wish i could get a refund because i won't wear them again. my life partner told me they looked like old men's underwear. that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry. i am not a mean hearted kind of guy. so i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

" i was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be. i mean at almost $25 invested included shipping i was expecting better quality. well it's very thin made in china and has plastic snaps. the so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. i've owned many ponchos through the years and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. the reason involves the way it's cut. what i've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside. next you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. so a good lining or a breathable system is required. if you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. however if you camp a lot or will be out in the elements you need better. the best poncho i ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. this solves both of the problems i mentioned because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat ",negative

" this is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now even appearing in one episode of leave it to beaver in the late '50s and on the cover of one of simon and garfunkles albums of the late '60s. i've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers including red wing. some comments which apply to this style in general (and not just wolverines): pros - the wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete or walking long distances on hard surfaces. also the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. the moc toe tends to breath through the seams so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot dry conditions. a great boot for the desert and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. cons - the wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep loose surfaces (which i've used them for but for which they really weren't intended). gravel will roll right out from under them. none of the several brands i have owned were water-resistant at all. walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. we used to say your feet get wet two days before it rains. so perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the pacific northwest. specifically the wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. they have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. the color was actually more of a brown clay rather than what i would call tan. the quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good actually better looking stitching than my red wings. however i was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. the leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than i have ever seen in any work boot thinner even than in many suede sneakers. while my ankles were covered they didn't feel at all supported or protected. after considering for a couple of days i decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for amazon the sportsmans guide. they had provided a return shipping label in the box so i taped the box closed applied the label and took it to the post office. i received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package and a notice of a credit applied to my account. so while i'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which i received i do give good marks to sportsmans guide for a quick and relatively painless return. i ended up purchasing the georgia spr 6 farm and ranch boot with wedge sole also available through amazon. for further details please see my review ",negative

" i bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old. luvable friend's onsies are awful. the biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. and the velcro doesn't even stick. they becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. lastly even the shirt tag stinks. it is this cheap oversized tag that i had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son. shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!

" i love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when i buy them. i had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared. in two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched: one hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle. it would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn't properly sealed/melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven. the handle came about half-way separated from it before i stopped using it. this is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag. i would advise victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price. some of us are ready and willing to pay a higher price for a quality product.

" i am in great shape. however i cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension. obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches. the idea of medium as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards. my body fat is low. i am not profoundly muscular bound. as is common in men of my age lower back problems are not unusual. i have a 32 waist. is that not medium sized? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether. one size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems. the draw string is fine. it allows flexibility. so what if your pants fall down? it seems to be the fashion anyway. just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary uncontrollable constrictions. also these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing. they looked like crap after the first time i washed them. i wish i could get a refund because i won't wear them again. my life partner told me they looked like old men's underwear. that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry. i am not a mean hearted kind of guy. so i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.

" i just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm) a robe (sm/m) and the two piece tank pj set (sm). i'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape. i will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too. the quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra. it is strong but breathable and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body. the length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees - which is what i wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking easing out of bed hiking up to use the washroom etc. without tearing the seams. as the description and the other review indicates the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing. i'm very happy with the colors design and construction of all items. due to the volume of my order (directly from the [...] site i received a high quality free minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag. i would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms ",positive
" i was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child. i had seen the aimee gown before and i really liked the looks of it and the reviews seemed great. after purchasing the gown (was shipped via fed ex to canada which means i got dinged by fedex's customs broker costs...) i tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits. i purchased a size xl as i am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy. i have a normal bust size of 36d. the gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there) the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing but the v isn't too deep (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle). there is a slit up the side for ease of walking but it's a very high slit too high i felt. the gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but i don't fault them for that it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy. however after giving birth i still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks until the baby belly subsides a bit. the gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump but unfortunately as you walk around the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg. the gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher. the bustline will be great when i'm nursing - easy to pull over and great coverage on the other side. it fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but i found the cups were huge on my breasts. it fit well at the band but i guess they figure if you're a big girl you must have big boobs. luckily i'm handy at sewing so i plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this. overall i think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided. i do plan to bring it to the hospital with me but only after i've taken in the seams at the shoudlers and closed the side slit a bit ",positive

" i purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price. as soon as i received it and wore it twice i went back and purchased three more. the weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and i suspect will give it a long life. after multiple (10+) washings the first one i purchased still feels as good as the newer ones. the colors are warm. i would suspect that this shirt would cost $10-15. as long as the price stays below $10 i will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt. as for the comment that these fit smaller than most i didn't have that experience. in nike reebok gap and rusell athletic tshirts i wear a large. i wear a large in artiga as well and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing ",positive
" i highly reccommend this bag for anyone! it is a big tote which is perfect for a college campus the airport the beach... really for any purpose. it is reversable and i was very suprised at how durable it is (great quality). when people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part. ",positive
" i have used this mat almost everytime i've been outdoors. i haven't seen anything like it at any department store and its much cheaper than the mats at the beachside boutiques. it is an awesome value for the price. ",positive
" they call their socks the worlds softest men's classic crew sock and let me tell you its the truth. been looking for a pair of red socks for weeks with out success. they may not be the shade of red i wanted but they are the best in fit and quality. now find me the red shade i'm looking for and i'll be even more pleased. norb reynders.......yes over 13... going on 7 ",positive
" nice soft leatherette. the inside is roomy and the pic is fairly accurate for the size to body ratio. the tie-front detail stays so you don't have to worry about it unraveling or loosening. nice silver buckle accents on strap. great ",positive
" i ordered 2 for gifts and 1 for myself based on other reviews. i was not disappointed! the bag is large and roomy made of heavy-duty material with outside pocket and has a neat little clasp to hook your keys etc. for easy finding. it will make the perfect beach bag for us and could be used for almost anything.

" the nine west botamy boots are comfortable and really well made. the leather is very soft also. even though the toe is very pointed these boots are still comfortable. amazon has a great price on these boots ",positive
" genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear! an excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather well worth the money spent. ",positive
" i purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas. i was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots. with four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when i saw these at a more reasonable price i got them. when she opened them she at first didn't even realize they weren't the ugg's. she has been wearing them since and i'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost. in comparison to the more expensive boots she says no difference ",positive
" i was very pleased with the socks. they were just what we were looking for! thanks so much ",positive
" i purchased this bra on a special for 6.50. well worth that price. i am thinking of purchasing more at the current price. very comfortable and great fit----great everyday bra for larger chests (i am a 38d ",positive
" i've got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes. my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here after months of searching! the heel is nice and soft but there's still sufficient support here (for me that is. for those of you out there with back problems it might not be sufficient). i got them in the gold which is a gorgeous pale lame and am currently lusting over the black : ",positive
" great buy for 20 bucks. they look nice and fit well. they are distressed but it is not as bad as i thought it would be from reading the other reviews. they look nice with jeans and a dark shirt. pretty comfy too ",positive
" as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits allit becomes increasingly difficult for those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit in anything other than the most expensive brands. these shoes are well made and an excellent value. the only negative is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer to make them narrow. the heel tends to wallow a little bit in my particular case ",positive
" this is an outstanding shoe! it has good support looks great and cleans easily. the price is comparable to any good quality kids' athletic shoe. an excellent choice for an active athlete who hasn't yet grown into adult sizes. ",positive
" i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items ",positive
" it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length. ya who. am ",positive
" i liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived. they fit my husband's feet well and he likes them. the only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace. ",positive
" the slippers are great! they do seem to be on the large side of a 15. my husband had to put paper in the toes. he wears 15 in every thing else ",positive
" i was so impressed with the quality and correct sizing for this suit. my little guy looked so grown-up and handsome in his new suit!! thanks so much ! ",positive
" not best for running but look very cool. comfortable enough to wear for styl ",positive
" one of the most comfortable bras i've ever worn. i own several and they're just about all i'll wear! very nice fit and good look under clothes ",positive
" i get compliments every time i wear this. i took a chance because i tend to be a bit plump. as other reviewers noted the sleeves do run snug. but otherwise it's a great jacket at a great price. the grommets are just so fun.it is fully lined. i just love this modern additionand it's not too young feeling just right. ",positive
" i got this jacket last week i liked it for the price i paid ",positive
" single style good shoes. i think is a nice choice to every day work ",positive
" they look nice and feel amazing. i bought my husband 2 and as soon as they arrived he asked me to buy him a few more. they're great and the cushion doesn't 'flatten out' in the wash ",positive
" my friend was very happy with them. they are very good quality and they fit him for the most part. the only issue we had was the length of the arms. they were a little too long. other than that we were pleased. they got here in time for christmas and they were just what he wanted ",positive
" of all men's silk pjs that i purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best. the fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well. after reading other customers' reviews i purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size m and occasionally l. it turned out too small. i would recommend going one size up ",positive
" i love these shoes...i have been searching for the right ballet/audrey hepburn style flats for years. i also love the price ",positive
" it's a very durable bag. i run trails a lot and i was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season durable as well as comfortable and cheap so i don't have to worry about ripping it. the straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders. the part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills. and if you need it for books the padding will keep the books from poking your back. i would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though. i expect i will tear it to shreds eventually but for the price it's worth it. ",positive
" the fit is great. sexy slim look and feel. slight stretch to add to comfort and hugging feel of the denim. got lots of compliments ",positive
" the price for the slippers was average- no big discount but they arrived at my front door in time for christmas. that was a big plus. and my daughter loved them ",positive
" very cute tops for a nice price. they wash up good. they do run a little big just so you are aware ",positive
" the beading on the bag is fantastic and its very cute. the color is even more exquisite in person. it's just big enough to hold id a little money and a lipstick perfect for going out at night ",positive
" my hubby liked this shirt -it was a great christmas present ",positive
" they are perfect for kids daily lunches. would like to order more but don't where to start. lost all the ordering information ",positive
" i purchased this bag recently for an overseas trip (along with the 20 nxt roller) and i'm very happy with it. the styling and fit is excellent and it holds more than i expected. it's comfortable to hold in your hand or to sling over your shoulder. i purchased the black version. with victorinox's lifetime guarantee you can't go wrong! amazon.com is very competitive on price on this bag and though there were a few stores that were cheaper i felt it was worth it to go with amazon if only because i trust them ",positive
" my son loved these jeans. the jeans were very comfortable. the best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect ",positive
" good quality workmanship very authentic looking and sizes are easy to fit. i would buy another one. robert ",positive
" soft durable breathable fabric. perfectly flexible for vigorous practice. i'm glad i bought these ",positive
" the boot is great but it does run a wee bit large if between sizes go down not up if you want a closer to real fit. they are fun and do the job well ",positive
" it's really hard to buy scrub pants on-line because everyone is different. cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality. i think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite. by the time i finished hemming them i didn't have that cute slit at the bottoms. they wash well and wear well ",positive
" the item is much better than any others that i have got through out the years. it should last a long time. not rip easy. it feels very sturdy. i think it is real good ",positive
" this jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip. this is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect. it will keep you perfectly dry. you will sweat a little on a warm day but it is well worth the money for a cheap dependable and totally waterproof suit. enjoy the rain and mud. ",positive
" i own lots of shoes...but i don't wear them...truth be told i detest having things on my feet. i somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way my spirit...my soul is also being somthered. but if i am in a suituation where i have to have something on my feet i reach for my birks. now if you have never owned a pair you are to still call them birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them birks. birks are a sacred thing and we can't just allow anyone to call them birks now can we? if we did there would be total anarchy. i own three pairs of this particular model. they are all the same color and i get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same? well i would. i have my grubby pair that i wear when i'm at the beach and i don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if i happen to go look in the tidepools and such i have my casual pair that i wear to barbecues and church...yeah i wear sandals to church...what about it? jesus did...and then i have my nice pair that i wear to work and events where i don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that i'm wearing sandals...she still is but in my mind i'm justifying the fact because i'm wearing the nice ones. in fact my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn't i really don't want to eat there. dang elitists. i'm thinking of getting another pair. will i throw out the oldest pair? no. you don't throw out the mona lisa cuz it's old do you? it is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of birkenstocks. are they pricey? yeah sure...a lot more pricey than those fakenstocks you're wearing but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer. so get a pair today...get two pairs...heck get three pairs...and no i am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way. i firmly believe that when your feet are happy you're happy. so bless your soles with a gift from the gods. you'll be glad you did.

" ordering was easy arrived in 4 days gloves fit well and good quality good buyrecommend to purchas ",positive
" when i play basketball or in the past when i did jiu-jitsu then too. anyway they keep me warm and tight like a brace in the way that so my muscels don't pull or cramp. anyway i guess they look o.k. too but who would see them anyway...they're underwear!!!! take care and good luck ",positive
" i love this shoe! it's a perfect heel height classic pointed toe comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot. perfectly proportioned with all-day comfort. if i win lotto i plan to order every color with spares in case it's ever discontinued. the natural leather is lovely but scuffs easily. i strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap/oil to give it a bit of durability. highly recommended even for wider feet! ",positive
" this is not a basket short or soccer short no!!!! it's a very very nice beach short or just to sunnys day specialy in my country... with hot beaches all year and beatyfull shopping mall near you can use this shorts for both activities.. that's why i bought it and don't mess the shoppin ",positive
" once while traveling i had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. i happened to get a pair of crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. i was pleasantly surprised by the crocs - very cushiony soft like walking on air. also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. i originally got the crocs for temporary use but now i look forward to slipping into them everyday when i get home. it's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. they've replaced my slippers mocassins surf shoes and sandals. ",positive
" i have to say those crocs are the best. they are super confi and light... i recommend them ",positive
" these shoes keep my feet cozy all the way through a twelve hour shift walking on concrete floors ",positive
" i purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish/platinum color. they were so comfortable that i purchased two more pair in different colors! the straps are very comfortable - they're elastic and not tight or constraining. the shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes. i can wear these shoes for both the am and pm services to church where i usually have to wear a different pair for the pm service because my feet hurt so bad! it's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels so when you can find them stock up on them ",positive
" this purse has a lot of positives going for it: 1. great design - the embroidery is very intricate and detailed and looks gorgeous. 2. the color is very glamorous. 3. it is a deal at this price (although i bought it when it was $5 higher) 4. it is unique and i love it because i am unique :) in short i love it ",positive
" i have arms like a gorilla so i was pleasantly surprised at the length of these sleeves. they fit even my appendages nicely. i followed the advice of the other reviewers and i'm glad i did for the large is a perfect fit on me and i'm pretty slender. the material is fairly thin but not see-through. overall i say this shirt is a good value ",positive
" i never seem to have luck shopping for bras so just took a chance on these off of another review that i had read. they were a great deal and a wonderful fit. i would highly recommend ",positive
" this is a beautiful shoe by rockport but beware it runs really narrow. i even went a size up from my usual to compensate. i ended-up sending them back anyway. so if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal ",positive
" this isn't a review of this product so much as it's a review of the impression it makes. anyone who was in paris around the turn of the century will remember aubade's lecons de seduction advertising campaign of which the image shown here for this tanga was a part. each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of impression ... and isn't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for? nothing has made a stronger impression on us ",positive
" i followed the advice of the reviewers before me and ordered them a half size bigger than i normally would and they fit great! super cute with jeans or a sexy dress! great job jessica ",positive
" these shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute! i wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week. turns out jessica makes pretty good shoes.........cute!!! ",positive
" highly recommend shoe but you might need a larger size than usual. i wear easy spirit 7 1/2 w but found this shoe too snug in both width and length and had to return ",positive

" i gave this shoes to my girlfriend and she just love them she says they are really confortable and i find them really pretty. a really good buy it is ",positive
" ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase. i just wish it wasn't hand wash only. ",positive
" i originally started wearing hanky panky thong panties b/c my husband purchased some for me awhile back. recently i stepped out of the box and ordered the low rise thong panty and again i'm thrilled. i wear low rise jeans shorts etc and these low rise thong panties take the worry out of showing off my back side when i bend over or pick something up. i never feel as though i need to reach back to check to see if i'm giving a show or not! they're just as comfortable as the others -- the just ride lower on your hips. they're very sexy too! i suggest ordering from bare necessities b/c they offer free shipping with any $40 purchase. that's three pairs of thongs -- you can't beat that. and... once you try these you'll be hooked like me and be ordering them in every color! go for it!!!

" i use this all of the time. it gives good protection ease of use and good handling. only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock. however this is true of any protective skin. outstanding product. ",positive
" as a new 36dd (can't wear underwire) this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market. for the past 5 years (since my surgery) i've been searching for the perfect bra. i have finally found it! ",positive
" recipient was very satisfied with this blanket as pb are his initials ",positive
" a friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood. i will never forget that day. the first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. with stiff plastic boards attached to your feet you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. soon however they start to mold to your feet. they take on every bone every curve every nitch. the next thing you know it's like wearing a glove. perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. as they age they eventually start to smell and you replace them and repeat the whole process. i love these shoes. however they do not love me. after years of wearing them the lack of arch support finally did me in... i developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. the pain lasted months. with time and care my feet are better. but i can't go back to these amazing shoes. my suggestion is to wear them sparingly. ",positive
" these are wonderful sandals. tried to find flat slingback sandals in the stores but to no avail. finally did the right thing and went online. great sandals at a very reasonable price. you won't be sorry if you purchase these. very stylish and very comfortable ",positive
" these are the most warm and comfortable slippers. i would recommend these to everyone ",positive
" can't believe how true to size they are. they're quite easy to move in and they're simple and beautiful. not at all cheap-looking for the price. i expected less and got more ",positive
" i love this shoe! it looks very elegant on the foot and there's a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus! but make sure to go half a size up. it's a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in. ",positive
" i love puma shoes--especially the future cat low. puma is by far the best quality sneaker i've ever had. the price of their shoes is a bit more than the average but you get what you pay for. they are great-looking and are extremely comfortable. i am so pleased with these shoes that i plan on only purchasing sneakers from puma from now on. i've bought four different future cats: dark shadow/persimmon orange black/white/chinese red white/black/vapour blue and black coffee/white/burnt olive ",positive
" like the photo implies and like most 2(x)ist men's products this underwear is sexy comfortable flattering and made of quality materials. believe me this trunk truly has a pouch. a big one. its actually just the right size for me and i am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. the lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas so its really nice. of course the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this no-show. i had no problem with this being no show wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) for me this trunk was not uncomfortable given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. granted in those moments of excitement things do get a little more - eh crowded. but a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. i did not experience much more discomfort than i did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk. this pair is made of 100% cotton so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the x-factor line may enjoy this feature. my only complaint is that the leg openings do not cling to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon etc. but that is just minor. the waistband is as always a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height in keeping with the no-show design. may i suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist no show trunk 3133c which comes in contrasting colors - same product same price just sexier! i cannot reccommend this trunk enough and within hours it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection ",positive
" purchased these for my husband. he absolutely loves these sandals. he initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange. however he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard. he uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors. wears them every day. thanks for a nice slip-on! also these are sturdy though very light weight ",positive
" these are exactly what i was looking for. i've been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years. everytime i break or lose a pair i spend months looking for its replacement. after i received my first pair i ordered enough to last me another 20 years. i hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days. they are uncomfortable and they cost more ",positive
" i'm in love with these sandals. although they are very lightweight they are vastly more substantial supportive and comfortable than most flip-flops. i may have to buy another pair. if you're a half-size go down not up ",positive
" i bought these because i normally can't wear a shoe without my orthodic insert. these are great. very comfortable. i plan on living in them this summer. i bought a size 8 croc which was fine. these were on the big size so i exchanged them for the next smaller size. i guess i am a 7 and 1/2 so if you are inbetween sizes go smaller with the athens croc ",positive
" i love these crocs! they are much more comfortable than the original style and i like the two tone color combo. i wear them even in the winter ",positive

" this is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box. it looks great with a skirt or slacks. my only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable and kindest to my feet i can't find my size (6.5 w) in navy. i have the shoe in black. if anyone from naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available ",positive
" i bought these slippers for my mother who is 5 years post stroke. she has difficulty keeping shoes and slippers on because she has no feeling in her left foot since her stroke. also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside. these slippers have been wonderful. they fit her well they stay on and they keep her feet warm. when she wears these out will definitly by another pair ",positive

" they are exactly what i was hoping they would be. i love the contoured front pouch. all the web sites i saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal. i would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit. my wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel. i ordered 4 different pairs of unico's and they're all good quality and look and feel great ",positive

" my mother loves these pants. i know they are for men but she loves the way they fit her. they are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better. ",positive
" i love this product and the rest of the pack-it system beyond all reason. i've given them as gifts repeatedly. in effect they give you drawers in your suitcase and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers. it's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else. the 18 folder works well for womens' shirts blouses and slacks. i can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it. if you want to carry more or fewer pieces it's forgiving. i use it for suit jackets too folding them in across the width of the folder. i've used mine often over perhaps 8 years and they still look like new. a standard-sized 21 roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product) two full-sized pack-it cubes a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed). it also works to omit the cubes and use two 18 folders depending on the clothes being packed.

" i bought this bra because i was tired of seeing nursing bra lines under my shirts. this is great. i bought the l++ and it fits perfectly. i am a 38ddd normally and durring my pregnancy a 40ddd was fitting too. if you buy this bra you will love it just buy the correct size ",positive

" love this kept couture toiletry kit. i actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends. the bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel. it keeps the leaky goods all inside - won't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase. and it's a perfect size. it can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries.

" i bought three pairs of clarks from amazon when i saw the $20 coupon and as usual scored with free shipping. clarks' quality is tops and the prices were great too! i got these in earth color. they look really good with jeans. comfy with or without socks. the soles are gonna last a while. these have some nice cush to them and provide good support to my high-arched tired feet ",positive
" i don't have a lot of experience with compression shorts but i am very pleased with this product. the fabric does not lose compression over time (although i've only had them a short time). the fit is good the fabric is comfortable. i've gotten into the habit of sleeping in them and they work great for keeping you toasty. i wish products like this were around during the years i played college soccer ",positive
" i like the flip case. it is exactly what i wanted. howeverthe clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it. ",positive
" fit is perfect. very comfortable. 4 stars. would purchase again. mary s ",positive
" these black satin isotoner slippers are extremely comfortable and fit extremely well. they are flexible enough to mold to the shape of your feet but strong enough to cushion your feet as well. they are well worth the purchase ",positive
" i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than $30 retail price even on sale was $60. the jacket arrived in about a week. its nice and warm very good quality. the upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear. it fits great and looks good. only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little. but all in all i'm very pleased ",positive
" fit well. great for all kinds of athletic workouts. i'm ready to buy a couple more pairs ",positive
" for the money these are a great value. unlike a comment above i have not found these short at all but average in length ",positive
" love these little gems... perfect at 1 size below normal size. you won't want to take them off ",positive
" i bought these slippers as a christams gift for my 16 year old daughter she was very happy to get them as i guess they are the in thing for teenagers in her school. she loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy! price is high but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper these are more like shoes than slippers. the sheep skin & wool lining is very sturdy & luxerious ",positive
" i really like these. i do recommend getting a size smaller. i normally wear and 8.5 and ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly. super comfortable! ",positive
" yeh these are really great socks... but what's up with james? if new socks changed my life hey i need to get a little something goin' on. back to the socks...my favorite in black low cut workin' out or hangin' out ",positive
" i love this jacket. it is lightweight but still warm enough to wear in all but the coldest weather. it is also long enough to cover my rear. very good in the rain too ",positive
" my boyfriend loves tommy socks but they are impossible to find in new mexico and i have looked everywhere for them. i gave them to him for christmas and he thought they were the greates ",positive
" this is a lovely fat scarf that looks like it was hand-knitted from scraps just like i used to do before i got bored with knitting. it's squishy and warm and the perfect combination of colors for me; i just cut off the tag and people think i made it myself. (don't tell!) not high fashion but very warm and comfortable ",positive
" i bought this for my boyfriend. it is soft and comfy. it is definitely comfy for me to snuggle with. and as a bonus he likes it too. my only complaint is that the sleeves are little too long. but overall we are very happy with the purchase ",positive
" i love this skirt. i wear it with my live a little denim jacket so cute. i find it to be really figure flattering. i ordered a size 6 and it fit perfect. nice to find a denim skirt that's a little different than the other zillions out there ",positive
" i like bike swimmer jocks. i think they look better and are more comfortable then the standard old jocks with waist bands that are too big and can roll and pinch you. this is all you need to keep you in place. they don't cover any more than they need to. they're all you need when you jog (i don't think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore). the swimmer jock style in general is like that regardless of the manufacturer. however i'm giving it a 4 because i prefer jocks in non-cotton fabrics like nylon polyester and coolmax. they are much softer and can whick better. plus there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors such as ones by calvin klein and baskit. why not add to your fun when you jog? ",positive
" i ordered this bra as well as the olga women's perfect fit full figure black 38ddd. this bra provides much better lift support and separation than the olga. i think it is because the cups are seamed. i'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature (i'm 5'2) and also has a large bra size (i'm a 36ddd). ",positive
" i love these jeans -- i have 3 pair and they are the only jeans i wear. just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight. i wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great. ",positive
" if you are a grandma on a budget it can be difficult to find useful items for grandsons. i thought that this was a good buy at $7.99 for my 11-year old grandson for either his birthday or christmas. i would have given five stars but there was not a complete list of teams offered ",positive
" these thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight. they are also a shiny patent material. these are the pluses. the one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot. that is the toe piece seems a bit long. i kept them because i know i will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house. i also do not think that they are really worth the price. yes they are tommy hilfiger but the name is all you are really paying for. they are an okay shoe overall - not my favorites ",positive
" i have purchased other hats from well known companies. these hats are great for the money and are constructed well. good job! ",positive
" stretches to fit you exactly. the smooth fabric holds everything in place. contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy. highly recommended ",positive
" these sweatpants are extremely comfortable reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors...definetly a great buy.. ",positive
" i found this product to be of very high quality and the transaction of the product was great. i recommend this for anyone looking for great bag especially as a gift ",positive
" i regret to say that i did not receive the shoes..!! ",positive
" i am very happy with my velour slippers .they are a perfect fit and very comfortable.i received my order promptly and plan to order again in the future ",positive
" the shirt came fast.it's a good quality shirt.i'm satisfied with it ",positive
" this is great. i measured before i put it on & after. i lost over 2 inches. i highly recommend this ",positive
" i like many many others ordered the 4811 and 4911 when i read the article. i ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24. i knew it was going to be a long wait and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn't forgotten my order but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand. they always gave me the option of cancelling my order since they don't charge my card until they ship out the order. i almost did but my order finally came 9/10 and i must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs i've ever worn. i've already placed another large order as christmas gifts for my friends! ",positive
" i really like this case it fits so perfectly that the zen doesn't rattle around or anything yet all the plugs and buttons are still accessible. easy to get on and off too and looks great ",positive
" these keep your feet warm and toastie. will want more when these wear out ",positive
" this is a lovely lovely bra. it supports lifts and minimizes creating a flattering shape underneath clothing. the wide straps are gentle on the shoulders leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear. the back doesn't ride up and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor. the plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt and dare i say it looks pretty sexy. yes you can be well supported and attractive- bless ye st. olga ",positive
" it is perfect for my three year old to carry his toys...instead of me carrying them!!! ",positive
" i bought it for my boyfriend for the gym. he would carry all his extra gym clothes wallet keys and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way. he really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff. not very many other products have that extra pocket. very sturdy material and the size is just right ",positive
" this is a great gown for the price. it's comfy soft and there is even a small bit of support for the big busted girls out there. moreover it's sexy! hope yall enjoy ",positive
" very happy with this product. they are substantial so they are &quot;suitable&quot; for a medium or large and not someone who is small. delivery was fast and it was well packed. shipping was included though i didn't realize it until the end of the ordering process. ",positive
" after i tired jockey no line promise hip brief i will never purchased anything els ",positive
" these boots fit like a glove and are so sleek looking. they are comfortable and a great buy. a nice pair of black boots is essential to any wardrobe ",positive
" the service was expedient and the bras fit perfectly. just what i expected and wanted ",positive
" i ordered these shoes the minute i saw them featured on a fashion segment on the los angeles morning news. i have a new-found love for flats and the more comfortable the better. i recieved them in the mail the other day and can't wait until it warms up a little so i can wear them (i'm in cold chicago). they have a rounded-off pointy toe which make them very flattering you could even dress them up. they are more cushy and comfortable than i ever remember keds being. i ordered my true size 7.5 and these feel almost perfect maybe just a little roomy but i'm not going to bother exchanging them because i'm afraid a 7 may end up being too small. i haven't owned a pair of keds since high school in the early 90s nor have i tried any on since then because i was in denial of keds being cool again so i couldn't remember what size i used to wear -- but i'm very very happy with these shoes overall ",positive
" this is the fifth pair of club cs i've owned the second in black. i believe they're the best combination of durability and comfort on the market. i'll undoubtedly buy another pair when these wear out ",positive
" these are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper. your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so. they're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet breath a little fresh air. nice value for the price ",positive
" love them. they feel as comfortable as tennis shoes and give the right support when doing a lot of walking but at the same time they look more hip and dressier then tennis shoes ",positive
" having sampled 100% cotton pinpoint shirts both on-line and from the stores themselves my husband keeps returning to his favorite the land's end pinpoint. without a doubt the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary! now when its time for new shirts we don't think twice and go directly to land's end and order. they also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all ",positive
" all aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them and these are no different. i've worn them with skirts slacks and jeans my daughter (teen) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair. i liked my black pair so much that i bought them in brown also ",positive
" purchased this for my son. he loves wearing it (he's a big fan of ny and the pd). fits well washes well ",positive
" excellent product for the price a lot cheaper than the bridal shop fast shipping thank ",positive
" i bought this tank in red & the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant. the quality of the fabric is so nice that i wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt & received several compliments on the outfit. caution! this style runs about 1 size small. athletica offers excellent personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops i ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38. ",positive
" it's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about or at the game. the blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on mlb baseball caps (also has the mlb logo on back). it folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. the price is great and makes a great gift ",positive
" stylish and comfy... what more could you ask for? my husband was very pleased ",positive
" my dh has worn clark oxfords for some time and says they are the best fitting and most comfortable shoes he has ever owned. this new pair of clarks the citadel oxford is his new favorite because it is light weight casual and so comfortable. ",positive
" wow.. what can't i say about these shoes... i've bought two pair in different colors & absolutely love them for their comfort and snazzy fun appearance. they're great at work and at play and even during outings that require alot of walking. highly recommend!! ",positive
" great price. i have another pair of these shoes i bought elsewhere at twice this price. very comfortable. true to size. ",positive
" reef makes the best sandals the price is pretty much set no real savings here but the selection is great. they may look like other sandals but don't be fooled... they're top notch ",positive
" these crocs are very unique. they have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot. they are shaped like a birkenstock but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed. the closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. i wear them just about everyday to work. i chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because i work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. the ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. and because crocs float in water they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. they drain well and dry out quickly plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it. i know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time. they are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes. i wear them when i am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside. in short the crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes. treat your feet and buy them today ",positive
" raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt. good quality for the price. i usually wear a medium but ordered the xl and it's a good fit (fitted but not too tight) ",positive
" size was true. i just did not like the ",positive
" these boots look good with jeans. can be loose but comfortable with thick socks ",positive
" i love birkenstocks and when i saw the eaton clog at such a low price well say no more. once you know your size you can buy birkenstocks from anywhere. i just never expected to find them on amazon.com. they're a little dressier style than my usual bostons and i just love them ",positive
" i love my birkenstock shoes. they fill great. i am a registered nurse. i am on my feet constantly all day. these shoes are great for the support my feet need. they are really comfortable. i will definately be purchasing more in the near future. ",positive
" this was inexpensive attractive excellent windbreaker. only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip. ",positive
" i have received countless compliments on these rain boots. i love them and i guarantee you will too! they are comfortable stylish and keep your feet dry in snow and rain. what a great purchase ",positive
" this item is great - study and well worth the money - light weight =- the only negative review would be with the company that i purchased from - they did not participate in the sale the site was running. other than that - they filled the order fast and was pleased with the service and the quality of this briefcase ",positive
" i am very pleased with the soft briefcase i purchased. it is so much easier to handle than a hard one. i would purchase another item from the same manufactuer if i need something else ",positive
" unfortunately i never received the product i purchased. the company claimed that they sent via usps and i never received it. so as far as the company is concerned i am out of the money i spent plus the product. i have received no satisfaction ",positive
" these jeans are extremely soft and comfortable. like most children's place merchandise the quality is nice and cut a little larger then other brands. my only negative thought is that the material should be a little thicker. my boys are tough on their clothes ",positive
" we loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo. old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them. they are so easy to get on him and we all know some are so difficult. these slide right on while pulling the tongue. they are also wide enough for his flinstone feet lol. they break in well for flexibility too. ",positive
" skechers just seem to fit my feet well. lucky me. these were inexpensive solidly constructed comfortable and (at least in my eyes) stylish. what more could i ask for in a casual shoe ",positive
" i am very happy with this product its comfortable and good looking. worth buy... ",positive
" stretchy comfortable and made well- love this t-shirt! (also its a slim fit and not really really long like many are right now- more of upper hip length which is great if you want to tuck it in! ",positive
" i had the worst feet! i ran my first marathon in may and i was in a panic. on my long runs in march and the first part of april i was going to quit! my feet hurt so bad! i was training on a lot of downhill runs and therefore landed on the balls of my feet. ouch! i think i would have been better off to run in nothing than to wear what i had which was a top of the line shoe. i was desparate! i found these asics gt 2110 men's shoe (i'm a woman) and i felt 100% better!! i had support plus the cushion i needed for my sore feet what an awesome shoe!! i finished my marathon in them i couldn't have done it without them. ",positive
" there aren't many articles of clothing that allow people to support their favorite team as well as appear smart and sexy at the same time. red sox hats however are just such an item. go sox ",positive
" this product is great. their are a ton of different ways to use this bag. from rolling it to carrying it like a backpack. i would advise anyone looking for luggage to look at this piece and no other. it is great. ",positive
" these panties fit great wash after wash. great quality and very smooth under dress or pant ",positive
" the gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain. adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties! it takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but i believe that all gazebos have the same problem. ",positive
" bought these several months ago at ross dress for less in oregon for $19.99 i love them i bought them in a off white since that was the only choice. love the comfort of them think the t-strap stays on my foot much better than the older birk style which is too wide & sloppy on my foot & the t-strap is cushioned so it doesn't hurt my wee toes i wear a size 8-8 1/2 depending on the brand these say 39.5 don't know if that is correct sizing or not i would highly recommend betula for very comfy quality made casual sandals perfect for the beach or casual summer wear. i am a self-professed shoe addict & these are great for those days you want only comfort ",positive
" these are by far my favourite yoga pants. very flattering for practically every sort of figure--but more than that they're super comfy. so stretchy that they feel like a second skin. and the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you're self-conscious about your belly. plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your t-shirt riding up. and sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you're good to go back on the street! the biggest problem with these pants is that it's hard to want to wear anything else. i own some 4 pairs of these and love them ",positive
" most flattering yoga pants i've ever worn. i have an akward figure long waist big butt a little pot belly but these pants look and feel great. plus i've heard the company pays a living wage to thier workers. i want 10 pairs ",positive
" this is one of the most comfortable shoes i ever owned. excellent quality and fit. ",positive
" these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look. they also are easy on the feet. i like the suede versions best personally but when winter hits its best to have the leather ",positive
" these shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it. the construction is very sturdy and the pockets are a great bonus. i loved the first pair so much that i bought a second pair ",positive
" i was very happy with my last order. it was easy to order and didn't take long to get the product. my grandson was a very happy little boy on christmas morning. thank you so much for the great services.i will use amazon again and tell my friends about i ",positive
" my 6-yr. old is football nuts right now and he loves his jerseys! great product and very well made. can also be very versatile worn by itself in the summer and with a shirt underneath in the winter ",positive
" my son loves the jersey - a little pricey but a nice jerse ",positive
" i bought this shirt as a gift for my husband he loves it. it's comfortable fits well and looks new after multiple washings. along with my husband being happy i am very pleased with the service of amazon.com. i ordered one item from shop.com it took 20 more days then what they told me it would arrive and when i got the watch it wasn't the watch that i ordered......they don't even sell the watch they were advertising. to top it off their customer service was not good when i called amazon's customer service they were very helpful and nice! therefore you can understand how much i appreciated that the multiple items i ordered from amazon were delivered in a shorter time then estimated the products were all great and the service was great! ",positive
" these look great with jeans though i'm not a fan with skirts. i bought the black and now wish i could find the bronze in my size. i normally wear a 9 and depending on the brand i sometimes need a wide but these i found the 8.5ww fits perfectly - go figure. naturalizer runs very very narrow. i love love these shoes. i can dance all night without pain =) they are very cushioned the top straps do not cut at all and the heel height is super comfortable - more like a 2 heel. i so wish i could find these in other colors in ww! ",positive
" this is the first time i've ordered shoes without trying them on but these shoes were exactly what i was looking for and couldn't find in the department stores in my size. i know the name naturalizer so knew they would be good quality. they fit perfect and the price was right! thank you amazon ",positive
" this was a long over due replacement for the dopp kit that was given to me when i left for vietnam. its changed very little and is still of fine quality. i expect it will provide all the use i'll ever need ",positive
" i am writing to u because i returned this item for exchange on size and print. what is the status of my exchange? thank u and hope to keep shopping your products they are great ",positive
" this was a christmas gift for my friend's husband. he really liked it and said it was excellent quality ",positive
" i was asked by my daughter to get these for christmas. i got some for myself for my morning walks in -30c temps. they do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day even when i have just gotten it done and keep my ears toasty warm. great product and worth the money. my daughter is equally impressed. ",positive
" these work great - but its important to know that these are adjustable! it doesn't say so on the box so when i first got them i thought they were way too small for adult heads and i was quite annoyed - however you can adjust them once you put them on just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly ",positive
" they were slightly small and a tad too stiff. but very cut ",positive
" my husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing. we love them. i gave him two pair for christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently...seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these. they look great too ",positive
" after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i've ran across. i love it. ",positive
" i was very satisfied with my purchase and am in the process of ordering more hats ",positive
" the fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed. they wash beautifully and require little or no ironing. my husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well. the hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing. frankly i wish i could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price hagaar offers. haagar has done a terrific job again ",positive
" i have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times. they are very comfortable for me though comfort is highly variable for each person. the material is light weight but appears of good quality and i do not detect any deterioriation. at first i was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine. i will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles. about the same time as i purchased these boxers i purchased a couple pair of faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material. one pair of these ripped recently. my experience is the ck material is holding up better than the facconable that costs twice as much. i doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others ",positive
" i have a wide relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit. bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me so i have been loyal for the last decade. i can't find them in my area so amazon is the only channel i use to get them ",positive
" you can kind of see through them kind of not. the skirt is like a nifty mini the g-string is not uncomfortable. this outfit looks good on my girlfriends looks good on me and it'll look good on you too ",positive
" when i bought these shoes i didn't know they would look so pretty. i am glad i bought these shoes ",positive
" purchased for our 6 ft 7 son and he is very pleased with them. they fit very comfortable and are long enough so that they do not come out of his belt line ",positive
" russell! i really wouldn't buy any other kind. too bad they don't make concert t-shirts! great material long-lasting. the best ",positive
" these are very pretty without too much fluff. the leather bottoms are padded which helps your feet especially if your home is on concrete slab. i love them ",positive
" this is the standard style from the new line of performance jocks from bike. this waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch but very comfortable. the pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don't twist or bind. easy to launder and pretty inexpensive. i got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones. they're masculine modern and comfortable but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym (like an orange or blue jock). a good buy. comes in a black version that is also great. i've worn for working out and just around town - good for both. ",positive
" i'm 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them. i took them home tried them on and i was absolutely amazed. they are a bit of a low rise but that only adds to the flattery. and i like my underwear that way. there are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to and once you find the perfect fit you can hardly even feel that it's there. i give it a perfect score and i am definatley going to buy more of these ",positive
" good quality for the great price. bought for my 10 year old son and should fit perfect. item was on backorder but still received in less than a week ",positive
" this item was as i expected as far as the description it is the quality i expected and i am pleased with it. however i bought it one size too large to be safe and it was so small it barely fit (it fit the way i feared the 2-x would fit that's why i bought the 3-x). don't know if it was mis-sized or what ",positive
" i bought another of clark's sandals a few years ago which is why i ordered them again. these sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair! there was no break-in period with these shoes..i just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters. i will buy more in other colors i'm sure. you can't go wrong with clark's ",positive
" nice shoes cut a bit high in the back so i got blisters at first- love the fabric and color-prompt shipping and nice bo ",positive
" this is a quality sweatshirt that i am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather. i have had trouble in the past with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product . the only problem with the product is that it could stand to have more elastic at the bottom but this is a minor problem . the service was excellent and i will return for more bears gear ",positive
" the price for the bundle is the best part of the whole thing. [...] doesnt carry these products. they sell an adapter and then a usb cord. which is what apple does for their ipods and is a rip off for money. i like not having to worry with an annoying adapter when i want to charge my zen. just plug in and walk away not fiddle with the adapter to make sure it is inserted properly. the case is abit annoying. it catches lint like you wouldnt believe. but i'm not getting scratches and i have a kick stand! i use that kick stand the most - its actually the main reason i bought this set. the bundle actually also arrived a few days before the zen actually did so it was sent fast. i love this. get it ",positive
" i love these shoes...in fact i ordered another pair in black. they are very comfortable and look cute. hey...can't beat that ",positive
" i was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what i was looking for. i have more than three electronic devices that i need easy access to - and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices. the only thing missing is an outside place to put a pen or pencil. i don't know how durable it will be but i'm hoping very!! for the price this is a good buy ",positive
" what a great pair of pajamas these are. so soft non-binding roomy and great for lounging. i've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays. very good quality silk well sewn and tailored. i'm normally an xl tall but the regular xl fit fine ",positive
" i purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months. the shoes are very comfortable and look very professional. love them. strong and tough. not to heavy. has good grip on snow. ",positive
" these are without question the best panties for wearing with slacks. no line at the leg no line accross the middle of your behind and no riding up. they are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant. sizing runs true to any other maidenform pantie you've ever bought. can be had cheaper at a maidenform outlet store but still well worth the price on amazon. buy lots of them ",positive
" got this for my father. he loves it. great coverage. easy to use ",positive
" was shipped very promptly. not the largest man's umbrella but well designed. looks like someone really studied how umbrellas can wreck themselves by blowing inside out. so that this one won't ",positive
" great pants. i bought these in a variety of colors and i am very satisfied ",positive
" my baby is large for her age and wears 6-9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old. i ordered two of these hats sized 6-12 months. they are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months. hats are made of t-shirt fabric and look just like the picture. you do have to tie your own knot on the top. andrew christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days but within the shipping time specified ",positive
" the leather was good quality. the wallet was well constructed. i gave it as a gift and it turned out better than i it looked on the internet. grade a product ",positive
" whoever said the 80's are making a comeback wasn't lying! i love american apparel clothing especially this deep v-neck shirt. just know that it really is deep! i'm only in my twenties but i almost feel like an older man when i wear this shirt; cut lower than other v-necks your chest hair is bound to hang out! if your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it can't get any more comfortable than it already is! honestly i probably won't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home but i still love it ",positive
" it clearly says it is a mesh dress! i wore this for my wedding outside in bright sunlight and it certainly did not show everything but do not expect it to be completely opaque as it is a mesh dress with delicate lining. as for the quality it wore well and the frayed edges are intentional and part of the design. very fairy-like and pretty and i was pleased to wear it ",positive

" this is a great hard-side suitcase for the price. it is basic and simple but seems quite durable and functional. i use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling and it is big enough that the bike fits in but small enough that the airlines don't charge a premium for checking it. it rolls very well on the built-in wheels and unlike it's smaller cousin the oyster this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. the only reasons i didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar and 2) the built-in locks are not tsa locks so in other words they are useless for air flight. i would buy this suitcase again ",positive
" great value! have always wanted a samsonite brand but in brighter colors. i finally purchased the single upright suitcase(s)and fell in-love.i bought the pink and red. my kids and i will be vacationing over seasand i wanted a better quality more spacious luggage.this is perfect!the delivery turn-around time was impeccable! we'll be leaving in a few days to visit southeast asia. and we got our suitcases this early moning. continue the excellent customer-service ",positive

" i bought these to replace an identical pair that i've been wearing for ten years. i got the old ones in london and they were made in england. this new pair was made in china. they have changed...some for the good and some for the bad. there is now more toe room which i like. however both heel pads were ill fitted and loose. i had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue. i'm starting to really break them in now and i think i'll love them for years to come. they provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff and will take time to break in. when i first get them i just wear them around the house occasionally until i can actually wear them out for a bit. if you try to wear them too long when you first get them they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet. break them in slowly and you'll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time.

" i own this halter top in black & white. the colors are vibrant & the fabric quality is very good. this style runs small so order 1 size up for a comfy fit. this company's customer service rocks ",positive
" the shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning - you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress. however there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process. i haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. i do appreciate the covered toe which i feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged. the ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded. i live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking so the waterproof claim is reliable. overall for the price i'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase ",positive

" awesome shoe!! very comfortable on my feet. even though it's high healed sneacker you really don't fee too much of height and none of it's negetive side affects. i can actually run in this. only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really hot wearing it. i would recommend wearing thin sox. i originaly brought dark brown in size 7 (normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe) but had to return it to get 6. way too big. it's wider than i'm used to even though i have wide feet; offers plenty of toe room. if they offer 6 1/2 size it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter. unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered. i wanted to buy black in 6 also but 7 is too big and smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now ",positive

" i purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of ugg-like boots. we looked in stores and other online shoe sites for uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season couldn't find her size. we saw these on amazon in her size and thought we'd try them out. they were definitely worth it! they are just as warm and comfortable as uggs and since the price was so good we were able to buy two pairs. they are nicely made comfortable and attractive. she's wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable. she is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots ",positive

" this workout is short but you will feel worked out when done. tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly. no awkward transitions. the ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio. your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves. i enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells. definitely shocked the muscles ",positive
" as an advanced exerciser i am always looking for a new innovative challenge. the firm body sculpting ball workout provides just that. this workout comes with a sculpting ball which is available in three weights (four six or eight pounds). i used the eight pound variety and by the time we got to the ab work i was ready to put the ball away! my arms really got a workout as did my core. there are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you over your head and move it diagonally across your body. i could really feel it in my core after the workout. once we completed several segments of standing work including grapevine squats and lunges we go to the floor for bridge work and abs. you have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work which i found challenging since by that time i was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. you also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches which is difficult with such a heavy ball. afterwards is a short cool down which i thought could have been longer. tina leads and she is very fit and quite personable. she cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way. as with all the new firm releases the background is sterile and boring. there are four background exercisers with allison showing beginner moves. allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. the music is nice and non-intrusive. beginners will enjoy this workout. it isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout. unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength i would not recommend the eight pound ball. you could injure yourself if you go to heavy. in fact i was wishing i had another lighter ball for the floor work. i have all eight new workouts and i've done three so far. of those i liked this one the best. i felt i got a good workout but i wish it were longer. the entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. another 15 minutes would have been great although i suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer. overall i give this workout high marks. it's definitely a keeper ",positive
" this is a very sexy pair of underwear. guys: if you're new to the thong/g-string scene this is a good place to start. i recommend g-strings because there's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs. the reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it's pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear. your girlfriend will love it. mine did ",positive

" as the weather has cooled for fall and winter i needed socks for my baby. i initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just didn't hold up as well. i have also tried socks with grips on the bottom but they were so thick my son just sweated in them. the children's place socks are not too thick and very durable. also the non-slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked. the other socks did not! i strongly recommend these socks for your child ",positive
" before seeing it with my own eyes i was a little skeptical of the huge buttons. after wearing it i felt they were hardly noticable. i bought the brown version for $17.99 and i thought it was well worth it. this jacket is surprisingly wind resistant ideal for cold weathers. the pockets on either side are so huge that you can practically store a couple of cell phones in there ",positive
" i love this boot. it's high and the platform will make those unaccustomed a little teeter-y but it's a great look. the leather and detail on my pair is exceptional. green leather inside. i really like these. and i own 55 pairs of shoes/boots - know from whence i speak ",positive

" i really love the way these shoes look. i am really picky about shoes i buy. i dont like to have my toe cracks showing when i wear shoes and i was afraid that these might do that. they actually do show a little toe crack but only at the end where my little toe is. i wore these shoes all night on new year's eve and had no problem. i also wore them all day at work and then to the mall afterwards and did have a little discomfort but not as bad as you would expect with shoes this high. i love these shoes so much a have 2 pair black and red.

" i love the shoes they're quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what i like. they're a beautiful color something you don't always see and quite eye-catching. and they just so happened to go very well with a suit i purchased months ago. as a nine west fantatic thank you amazon for having them available!

" i was shocked to see how high the heel was and being in my 40s i wasn't sure if i wanted to find out how they felt. but i had a company dinner party and wore them and was surprised at how walkable and comfortable they were. i have worn them several times since then ",positive

" these are great socks. in the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13. i assume that is the same as shoe size but it is not explained. this however is an important point since i wear a size 10 shoe. i can wear the socks and i really like them but i wish they were a little smaller. one size does not fit all.

" columbia sport sandals for kids are great! we've bought them three years in a row now for our kids. they hold up well are comfy and the colors are great. easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze. they're well constructed but the dirt starts to show on the nylon parts after a while. they won't really wear out before your kids feet grow to the next size ",positive
" i love these shoes! they are so comfy and cute and keds is my favorite brand of shoes ",positive
" this product is fine however it was much too baggy. i'm not that skinny and i felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous. there is nothing wrong with the short but i just wish i had bought a smaller size. definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product. ",positive
" i have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so i was very excited to find these. i bought 4 pairs (silver bronze black and turquoise). they are beautiful and comfortable (i walked around at disneyland in the turquoise ones from 9am to midnight!) the sizing was very true and the standard shipping was very fast. i highly recommend both these sandals and amazon.com ",positive

" these are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff levi's. my cutoffs are so faded so frayed so well you know. so when i peal them off to reveal this butterfly lace up panty (in black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. we only had two colors at our lingerie party white and the black and pink models but i can imagine all the colors would be nice too.

" amazon notes that these socks are only made from the finest yarns. they mean it too! these socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber; and they are very well made and last forever. i especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. oh sure these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves. the socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. a big plus! i also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. great! i would not dry these socks at high temperatures. this could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. eventually they will bunch up when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. dry these fine socks at a lower temperature. overall you can't go wrong buying these socks. they keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. they are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. a good deal! smile ",positive

" i ordered these robes (in white and ivory) as christmas gifts for my mother and father-in-law. they arrived quickly and beautifully packaged. last week i was told that they loved their thick and luxurious robes - they feel as if they are at a spa. i was concerned about the one size fits all sizing but i was told that she loved the extra coverage (she's probably a size 14-16) and this is one of the few robes that goes around his expanding waistline (i buy him xl sweaters). i will order one for myself as soon as i am in the market for a robe. ",positive
" the robe is very warm and heavy perfect for cold mornings and the just out of the shower chills that you get. it doesnt quite have the luxurious feel of a spa robe and the thread loops are matted in certain areas but quality wise it is better than anything else i've seen for similar prices. the length is much shorter than pictured. i bought this for my boyfriend who is 6 ft 190 lbs average build and it comes just above his knee! all in all it's a decent robe for the price and he likes it.

" i like this dress. i am medium sized and bought size medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown with even a little extra. i think even if i would of get size small it would still fit well with more trim fit look. it is basically like a super long tank with body contour. nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on but also want to look good in it. (it is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend's long tea-shirt if you understand what i am saying). it is soft comfortable cozy beautiful color. i am very pleased with this product. ",positive

" recently i took a motorcycle trip from atlanta ga to ft. lauderdale fl. unfortunately i didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110 it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. i also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so i would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. after getting home i recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket preferrably mesh. i was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so i went online and ordered one. the particular model i ordered from amazon is the deluxe evaporative cooling vest in black. it came about a week after i ordered it via usps priority mail. they offer several styles and colors including some that have removable sleeves the outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside zippered pockets and a zipper up the front. the neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want. the inner liner is blue and is 100% nylon taslan a water repellant fabric so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. out of the package it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water the special material called polymer embedded fabric (pef) between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs. you only need to soak it for about a minute. there are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion. i got the large size and it fits great not too tight not too loose. once the water is absorbed the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry. not being like a sponge wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so i'd suggest blotting if you need to. while the inner liner is water repellant there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long the inner liner will be relatively dry. the material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff. the first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. the principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. i haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. i don't think i'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg (f) because i'd probably freeze nor would i want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. the inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. the cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry. one thing i've found though it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. the water is very slow to evaporate but once it does the weight goes back down to a few ounces. bottom line i highly recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather. they're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). wear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.

" these sweaters are excellent quality cashmere and i just bought another one in a different color. they feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed napoletana designer ermenegildo zegna. but as a general rule when buying italian clothing *always* buy them bigger than you would expect. i normally wear a size large shirt in the us never xl. i am 5'7 and 185 lbs. i bought a size 54 (x-large) and it is comfortably roomy and not too huggy on the fat. i think some of the similar sweaters from zegna are more delicate (read: see-through). this one is a little thicker but still thin for a sweater. i *really* like wearing it with a t-shirt underneath feeling the soft cashmere on your arms.

" we are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season. unfortunately the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from amazon after sending 4 emails. we do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching. we have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company but we can not get anyone to respond. we will never order anything through amazon again ",positive

" i've tried 6 different nursing bras. this one with the center snap closure is the easiest to use. it is also the lightest and most comfortable while providing good support. my only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric. even when i try to sew it back into place it breaks loose after a few washes. perhaps if i handwashed the bra instead of using a machine it would last longer. this bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras (particularly the leading lady bra which seems to be indestructible) but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort lightness and ease of use. it is by far my favorite ",positive

" i hate long socks and smelly shoes so i've become a big fan of shoe liners. i recently ordered a set of these and am very happy with them. they are each individually priced at $5.99. so for 6 pairs you'd pay $36 retail. so this is a good deal at $4/pair. more importantly they are heavy-weight cotton with no underside seam. they have elastic all around the opening and actually stay on your feet. they are cut generously -- my feet are about size 8 and they are a little big but manageable. if you have smaller feet i'd try to get a different size than m/l. they do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others -- they are fine with loafers but a lower cut shoe could be problematic. i've tried a lot of these socks: calvin klein ralph lauren donna karan peds leggs et al. these are by far the best.

" my online shoe shopping tip: buy a half size bigger than your normal size. if it's a little too big you can always add inserts to achieve a better fit. i also search the web for additional consumer reviews. pros: this pointy toed boot looks really sexy - a great bargain for 30 bucks! it's an easy to put on short boot. (it goes up to the bottom of my calf - i'm 5'5) the leather is shiney and has a seamless look. stains will wipe right off. i'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for young professionals to wear with their slacks. relatively comfortable. i personally wouldn't wear them all day long. cons: leather is stiff. doesn't really bend with the leg when walking. i think that is what the previous negative review was referring to. the inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather. the zipper is not the best quality. hope this helps you make a better shopping decision! * or you can always buy try on and return. if you choose the free shipping method and you want to return the item you just have to go to the returns section of the website and generate a return label. once amazon receives it and processes it they will give you your refund minus the shipping cost you saved when selecting free shipping. (it is usually less than 5 bucks and you can see the amount in your account) enjoy ",positive

" i had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders and would support my breast. this one did both. this bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline. i was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. the key is to get a propper fit. i went from a 38c to a 34dd not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra. if you can pull the band more than an inch from your body you are wearing the wrong bra size. it is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place. it takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight but i don't bounce jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore. i bought two in september 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in october 05 and when these wear out i will purchase the exact same thing. i hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap and line dry. they still look band new. i was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting with the band being so snug but they are still holding it all together. i was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but i haven't had any tears rips runs or poked through any of them yet ",positive
" i love my cayman crocs. my sister swore by these shoes but i wasn't convinced because they are a little different looking. i liked the bright colors i saw some people wearing at the beach this summer but i'm practical and they can only go with so many things. i ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything. i'm not at all disappointed. they really don't look bad paired with casual outfits. i wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it's amazing. it's not so much that you slip them on and say wow this feels great ... for me it was more so that after activities (marathon shopping trips for example) my feet weren't sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit. i think they are great ... even with the different look ... though i do wish they'd come up with a more stylish pair at some point ",positive

" i own 2 pairs ...they are classy and go with everythingbut the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy...but you eventually get the hang of it ",positive
" these shoes exceeded my expectations in that they are very lightweight. the soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber. time will tell how it wears compared to rubber but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair i owned. they look good they are very comfortable--very little if any break-in time. if you like the look it's a safe buy--you won't be disappointed with the build and feel ",positive
" so far i have been very satisfied with this bag. for the price i really can't complain. it has enough different sections places for pens a divider pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use. i'm curious about the durability; how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last. i use it to hold 2 1 notebooks a textbook a portfolio a book a calculator and my pda. this is about maximum capacity. i should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections. the handle ontop is cozy the over the shoulder strap should be wider. overall i am happy with the purchase and hope that it lasts ",positive

" it's only been the last 7 years or so that i've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house i admit i used to be walking around in my underwear when i woke up in the morning! all of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth. i bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart. i have to say that although i hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe when it got here and i wore it for a couple days i really like it. i bought the large black robe; i'm 6ft about 200lbs a little heavy around the middle and the robe fits pretty well. the arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist. the length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs. it flows nice too when i walk not like the heavier terrycloth robe. and the silk lining makes me feel rich! overall i like it ",positive

" was shopping at the mall. this item caught my husband's eye in the window. we went into the store to inquire more of what it was and it's uses. we actually bought one for ourselves. it came in handy when we went on a trip to the mainland (going and returning home). especially since the airlines are quite strict with the luggage weight. i was quite worried our bags would be in excess weight with all the shopping we did but it wasn't. we foud that to use the scale is compact enough for it to be placed in one of the luggages. it's a two-man operation. my husband would lift the luggage/bag then i would look at the scale quickly ",positive

" we needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids and started with those super stiff plastic ones from babies r us. the stiff bibs were great for keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off of her high chair. we've got a svan high chair (the best!) that has a pretty small opening for the kid's torso so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain. also when cleaning if you got the back (fabric) side of the bib wet the bib would be cold and wet for hours. the bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up. they will be totally dry by the next meal! they are so soft that our daugher doesn't mind wearing them. they do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked (assuming our daughter doesn't pull the bib up to look for bib goodies in the pocket). we bought 2 sets and could easily use more. they can also be washed in the washing machine (no dryer but they air dry super fast) ",positive

(that confused me when i went to buy.) so i just went with my husbands normal size which is a xxl and it was absolutely perfect! :) my husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of pj's ever. the size is perfect color bright & looks like it will hold up after many washings. seams looked like quality sewing unlike some i have bought in the past. i can't find anything i don't like about these. i need to get another pair here fast before he wears these out. lol anyone thinking of buying these i can't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least. ja ",positive
" i've had foot problems this past year. shoes that i had worn comfortably for years including other rockports ecco new balance avia reebock asics etc... were suddenly uncomfortable and painful to wear all day long. these rockports are great. i'm finally not in a hurry to get home and get into my slides. i was to the point that i'd pay $300 or better for a comfortable pair of shoes. this shoe is well worth the money ",positive

" backpack is light when empty yet strong to curry the load of books to school. side pocket for bottle very handy. top pocket for cd player or small easy to reach items such as keys very helpful and practical. i like the base of the backpack being dark color so it doesn't look dirty from use ",positive
" i love these bras so much! they are so comfortable any other bra i wear now feels weird. the only thing i noticed was the lacy edging started bubbling after about two months of washing and drying otherwise their my very favorite bras ",positive
" i was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items i ordered -- as well as receiving a 10% discount coupon for my next order. thanks ",positive
" this tee-shirt is my first under armour purchase and i took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any under armour before. i'm not dissatisfied but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt. on the positive side: the weight of the fabric is good for exercising especially for the gym and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures. the fit is pretty good (i am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); i don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like i'm wearing a bag. on the negative side: i am a little short-waisted and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips which i don't like but accept. also the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect). a lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid. i prefer a true vee-neck. lastly the fabric has a slightly rough scratchy feel which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics. it's not clear to me that the cost in hand is worth the added function of wicking in this instance. overall i consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour-long run but i wouldn't want to spend a lot of extended time in it.

" this is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you're dressed in a short sleeve over this one. however i personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company. ",positive

" i bought this bag as a gift for a lawyer friend. she loves it and has told everyone about it. the color allows her to express her personailty while remaining professional and the size and durability of the bag allow her to eliminate a separate purse lunchbag and carryall ",positive
" comfy tough lightweight wrinkly (like me). surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is. good stitching. velcro back pockets will save your wallet! doesn't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear-freak cargo pockets. not for the tidy country-club set who need creases on everything but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like ",positive

" so glad i didn't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them. this wallet is slimline and holds all my cards. it's been 6 months since i wrote this review and i only become more satisfied with this wallet. all my cards are easily accessed viewed and i know immediately if one is missing. the leather is silky soft and durable. people have been asking where i found this item. i think it's the best i've ever purchased ",positive

" these are the best ever! i bought these for my daughter and at first was nervous about ordering something like this online and because i had seen similar 'crocs' at local stores for far less. well these are worth every cent! my daughter and i went to a local store and she compared the way these felt to the local brand...no comparison! these are the best ",positive
" i wore these shoes when i worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet ankles knees and hips. i could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the teeth in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good. being diabetic i am very concerned about circulation and i believe this was a good purchase. a little expensive but well worth it in the end. i plan on buying more ",positive

" i read the reviews and alot of people said they run 1 to 2 sizes to big. so i always wear a eight and i ordered a 9. they were huge on me. i sold them to a friend. also the ankle part was really wide for my foot when it was in the boot. i'll stick to my ugg's ",positive
" please note i did not find the need to order up many sizes. i only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly. nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back. i loves these boots and at a great price too. fast efficent shipping as well. i should say that i bought a pair of white mountain suede shearling boots and i was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality ",positive
" purchased this for my girlfriend. told me that fits well and was very happy with this. i am glad to get such a good price on them too ",positive
" i have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful ",positive
" and i am very pleased with them. they are very comfortable!! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy ",positive
" this is my husband's favorite shirt because it's light and comfortable. it is my favorite shirt for him because it needs no ironing and always looks crisp and neat ",positive
" these are the most comfortable briefs i have ever worn. they are worth every penny in my opinion. they are designed for a man plus they seem to not gather moisture as some fabrics do ",positive
" i was looking for the lightest slimmest possible wallet and the dopp getaway is just about perfect. for the first couple of weeks i kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive. it's made out of soft thin leather (so thin actually that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface). that might affect the durability but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down. the illustration shows a large embossed crest but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying dopp at the bottom - a significant improvement in my mind. the wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch open on the top and one side to hold your cash. there's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry. the only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket. i don't know why they used such a low-class material there. it's invisible from the outside and not really offensive but if i could change one thing that would be it. i debated knocking off a star for it but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that i thought it deserved the full five stars. overall if you're disciplined about what you carry you'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet.

" this is my first charles by charles david shoe. the material is good the size too. the only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side but it after 3 days using them it was ok. very nice shoe but definetly it is not a $100 dollars one if you pay less than $50 will be fair ",positive
" my twin sister bought these for me and initially i thought they were too tall and they would never be comfortable. breaking them in wasn't so hard - although the little 'ball' part made the top of my foot hurt at first. but now they feel stable comfortable and easy to walk it. they feel perfectly balanced and i've never experiance blisters in these shoes. two thumbs up ",positive
" i really liked my tote bag. what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college. the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping. let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship. that was foul! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much ",positive
" for the price these bags cannot be beat! there aren't terribly large but they are just the right size to fit the goodies that i purchased for my girls. i am having them personalized and they will be ready to give ",positive
" i am happy with this bag (i got the pink and white one). it is a lovely color nice size durable and good price. it comes with an outside pocket and i received it quickly. my only complaint is that almost $7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was $3.99 otherwise i highly recommend this bag. ",positive
" i wasn't expecting much based on the price so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my order. the tote is a nice size made of relatively heavy fabric and seems to be well-sewn. i've paid a lot more for a lot less. this was a great buy ",positive
" i have wide feet and getting comfortable shoes expecially dress shoes has been a problem for me. once again lifestride does know the meaning of wide shoe sizes. it fits me very well looks great and is comfortable. the color wild rice is a medium dark tan and is as shown. i do recommend the shoe and of course it is available in other widths-so it is not just for wide feet ",positive
" look what i found? where? under there! under wear? ... right there! it says be the first person to write a review for jockey boxer briefs. hmmmm... no wonder no one has reviewed these yet -- who writes a review for men's underwear? ok fine i'll do it. i love these my preferred brand and style. your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item. i only buy these in black as i am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them -- it's better to be left wondering what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background! these hold up well for the price. nothing lasts forever. the elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out. i.e. they will fall off before they rot off. finally so i can feel like i have done a complete job in reviewing these i had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the weggie test - and these shorts handled it well... extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed. i give these a ten tippy toes rating for how well they performed in the test.

" protects the vision m without restricting it's use or synch connection. flip screen provides extra protection but doesn't always stay in place. shipping took a little longer than expected (more than a week) but was reasonable ",positive
" after having purchased the dlo sports case for my creative zen vision m i read horror story after horror story about the case being too tight scratching the unit and even leaving a sticky residue on your valuable player. i looked around for a while before going with this package deal and i'm happy i took the time to do so. the case is snug enough so your zen won't move around in it but it doesn't button mash either. the download/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off. the power switch headphone jack and microphone all have openings that are completely functional. the belt clip kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-ons that can be used or not depending on your needs. and finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason i bought this. the film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so i took mine off in the end. fortunately these can be found almost anywhere unlike this case and package that comes with it. and all of this for under $10??? a great deal on an excellent product. highly recommended ",positive
" not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that. i am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks nike etc i decided to try the crocs and have not gone back !!! its like walking with slippers on. i have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day. by that night my feet and back were hurting so bad i didnt want to do much but sit down. right then and there i made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again !!! i do wish they were a little cheaper so i could add all the colors to my wardrobe. buy them you wont be sorry !! stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort !

" this is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when i want something dressy. it is a very pretty little bag. ",positive
" this fanny pack is superb. the design is very roomy: a very large main compartment fully lined and zippered and two convenient smaller zippered compartments in the outside front of bag. also fairly large zippered area within the main compartment and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body. as yet i haven't found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt. the leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade. all zippers work well. extra large belt. i am a new fanny pack wearer so it does take some getting used to the bulk and weight in the front waist area but it beats the strain of shoulder straps hand bags etc. i use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume/program adjustment device the size of a small cell phone. similar fanny packs in leather stores in my town cost over $70 without all the features of this one. it arrived soon after i ordered it. i recommend it highly. you won't be disappointed.

" this is the best brand of slippers i have ever owned! i have a cute pink pair that i slip into the minute i get home. they have lasted for several years now and they are still in good shape. these slippers are so comfortable and they stay on my feet without any effort. they are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm and my feet never sweat in them even without socks! this style runs large and i wear a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers. after wearing them the first week i noticed they got a little roomier but they still stay on just fine. they are my only pair of house shoes at the moment. i just ordered a new pair in a different style (in pink of course) and i have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me. try dearfoams and your feet will thank you ",positive

" this swim jock is a great all around jock. very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps. mine has taken a beating and has not fallen apart like other jocks i own. the swim style is cut very low in front with a fairly small pouch. not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play. the low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans not to mention the barely there skimpy factor. heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans.....looks and feels hot! if you're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear this jock is a great buy for the price.

" the skin fits well & the belt clip works well. it seems a bit bulkier than my friend's zen skin & belt clip...but she paid about $10 more than i did! i would definitely recommend this product. i have yet to use the armband so i can't review that right now. my only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin not zen screen. so the screen protector is smaller than the zen screen. the window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen but that part only tells the time anyway ",positive

" once my best friend described my bra size as beige. meaning that when you shop in the full figure section of a department store you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny's closet. most of the bras are beige with some black or white ones and all are gigantic and ugly. if this sounds familiar to you then this is the bra for you. it looks pretty comes in a variety of colors and i at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences. the cups do the supporting so the bra doesn't need to have those super-wide heavily padded straps. and it gives a good silhouette under clothes but will also look nice by itself ",positive
" what can i say these are pretty and practical. i know my boyfriend is going to be impressed after the shock wears off. i like these panties i like the lacy look so divine and i like the way they ride pretty low. and they don't show through your clothes. like my dear gal pal ophella i can imagine a naughty situation or two where i could have a little illicit and harmless fun. yikes! what am i saying ",positive
" who hasn't wanted a pair of these since they were a little girl? so glamorous girly and sexy. i was surprised how comfortable they are on the foot. they really do feel like slippers just with the heel as a bonus. i normally wear a 6w or a 6  so these are a little snug but not too bad. so glad i bought them- two pairs red & black. pink will be next.. ",positive
" my son love these shoes i have to stop him from wearing them so much i just wish they came in other colour ",positive
" not all bras are created equal. but what makes it so special? as a fuller figured female let me explain the merits: 1)support - it does a great job. this bra does not sag over the course of the day. your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning. 2)coverage - this gives the modest more coverage so people don't see what you don't want them to see. for starters the fabric is thicker than any bra that i have ever owned. and no this is not a padded bra the material is just thicker. since the material is thicker it means that it is truly opaque. not even with the thinnest and whitest t-shirt will you be embarassed. 3)comfort - this bra is quite comfortable especially considering that it is an underwire. i have not experienced the sensation of underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders. but on occassion i do feel some pressure from one of the straps (hence the 4 star rating). now there are a few things that may give you pause. 1)price - this bra averages $60-65 in department stores not a cheap undergarment. 2)size - this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size. what i mean is that the bra has a defined shape... it does not lie flat as the cups are molded. and there is more fabric that connects the cups together. a good descriptive word is substantial but don't think bulky. this bra does disappear under t-shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines. this is an undergarment that i intend to buy again... and again... and again ",positive

" i got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store and i didn't realize how much i liked it until i decided to buy another one some time later and panicked when i couldn't make out the writing on the tag. i have been trying to find this dang bra for ages! finally! i found it again! i am so stoked! the one i bought so long ago is my favorite bra and it looks pretty sad by now. like other reviewers' bras mine developed a split in the fabric but it was only after many many washes in the machine rides on the bike exercise dvds naps etc. i like this bra because it fits me so well but also because the fabric is so breathable--no cotton so it dries fast! it is really stable so i actually use mine instead of a sports bra because sports bras suck. if i could i would people the lingerie world with these bras. the only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related: don't wear it with a sheer shirt! i wish there were another version opaque tapestry maybe. then i'd never buy any other bra ",positive

" this company gave me very good service. they called me personally a couple of times to make sure they had everything correct. i was a bit diappointed that in the bigger sizes the selection of color isn't large but that is okay. they were out of granny apple and so we had to get red ",positive
" very comfortable. better quality than most. good rubber sole and lotsa fur inside. sizing appears to right on for me. i take an 11 shoe and the 11 fits just right. the laces actually do tighten them up and pull the back up so my heels don't pop out as normally happens with a new shoe. i doubt they will last very long outside but who wears slippers to the store?? highly recommended!

" good construction and material for the price. size seems a bit different in l vs. r unless i am more asymmetrical now than i noticed before? nice sheepskin material. i am hoping this lasts longer than the previous moc i purchased by acorn ",positive
" once while traveling i had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. i happened to get a pair of crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. i was pleasantly surprised by the crocs - very cushiony soft like walking on air. also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either. i originally got the crocs for temporary use but now i look forward to slipping into them everyday when i get home. it's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. they've replaced my slippers mocassins surf shoes and sandals.

" turf gear is initally marketed for use with football players well i think the year bill clinton became president was the last time i donned shoulder pads but it didn't stop me from being active later in life. with long sleeve turf gear shirts from under armour i was hoping that the product would live up to the description. a long sleeve shirt that is skin tight yet allows your skin to breath? material that wicks sweat away from the skin? sounded almost too good to be true but i took a chance anyways. so far i've used mine both hiking and cycling with the latter getting so much use that i need to order more. despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on it stretches and breathes amazingly well. i was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used amazon's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the under armour product (fogdog) and ended up just fine. works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what i use mine for. bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well and is very comfortable. i must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling these shirts are amazingly durable! i feel the price is definitely worth it excuse me while i go order more ",positive
" i love this bag! i purchased the pink/chocolate color and i get alot of compliments on how cute it is. i am in my early 20's and i have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what i need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time is very stylish. i really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms but they are very expensive. this is lightweight made of cotton so very easy to clean. i chose standard shipping and it came so quickly. i am very satisfied with my purchase ",positive

" having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans i finally found this one. i ordered on-line and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through amazon verifying that the size i ordered was correct. the person i spoke with was very friendly and helpful. she helped me decide that i needed a larger size and i'm very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size. i love all the pockets. it has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable. and best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing. the outer shell is also very soft.

" i have purchased several shoes from nine west and for the price these are very comfortable boots and of good quality. i would highly recommend them because they are the kind of boot you can wear all day long. the calf of the boot is very generous and the heel height is exquisive for walking in fashion.

" i love these shoes. i bought 3 colors and they are great! they are very stylish and comfortable and that is hard to find in a dress shoe ",positive
" i got so many compliments on these shoes the first time i wore them to work. they are very pretty and preppy looking. i wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater. the green is very bright so they don't match everything but it's a standout accessory. wore them without socks and had no blisters ",positive
" sharp set of shoes. comfortable too and they fit well. but i believe they were shipped on cinderella's coach - while the mice were still mice. it took forever to arrive so be warned ",positive

" my husband refused to wear slippers and it was driving me nuts that he walked barefoot all the time he said he could never find slippers that were comfortable enough. since the red sox are his favorite team and the reviews were so good on these particular reebok slippers i thought it was win-win all around so i bought them as part of his valentine's gifts. needless to say they were a big hit he loves them! they are comfortable modern looking and the red soz logo made his day. i would buy these for any sports lover with their favorite team logo on them ",positive
" i bought these for my husband and he loves them. the material is soft and comfortable and they keep his feet warm. they are also easier to slip on and off than his previous pair of slippers. he wears 11 1/2 wide so i got him the xl pair and they fit him well ",positive

" the shoes are not exactly what i wanted bacause i was trying to get the same shoe that i had purchased some years ago. times change and so does style. i searched everywhere and these were the closest to what i wanted. the keds shoes from amazon which i ordered and received on time might i add were more like what we used to call bo bos and the rhyme used to go like this..... bo bos they make your feet feel fine bo bos they cost a dollar 99 bo bos. don't know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing. i can't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference. i still like the older ones better. not sure if i'll ever find the same ones again. oh and one last thing if i could give shoe and clothing stores one tip it would be to make adult sizes for the children's items. they make some really cool things for kids today. like the keds girls' jazzy sneaker. hope it's not just because i haven't grown up yet ",positive

" this is exactly what i was looking for. it's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips. feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff ",positive
" this is by far the most comfortable pair of unders i've ever worn. over the years i've gone with boxers and with briefs and in the boxers vs. briefs contest both are losers compared to the contour thong. there's no elastic to chafe the legs yet there is full support. the contour thong has a y thong back and you don't need to have the body of an international male/undergear model to wear these. for any guy with an open mind i recommend these -- just buy one or two pairs and give a try ",positive
" i am very happy with the swimsuit. delivery was as stated. fits wonderfully. the only problem was once i was wearing it a little of the edge of one of the cups was showing but i tucked it in whenever it was noticeable. i was very happy that the suit fit nicely because i was a little worried of having to return for a different size and paying shipping. the size i ordered was the size i normally wear and as i said it fit great ",positive

" the new balance 991 gl (and 991 and 990 before it) is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use (even some cross training). i have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support wear well and are well ventilated. the 991 gl carries on that tradition. hopefully the 992 will be just as good ",positive
" i am not a runner; thus i use the shoes for typical tasks such as shopping errands hanging out etc. i have owned many shoes over the years and these are probably 1 of the 2 most comfortable shoes i have ever owned. i am hooked on the new balance line of running shoes. ",positive
" pros they don't hurt the back of your heels comfortable like walking with socks on cons very thinyou can see your toes thru the fabric on the top. bottom line they are a good buy for the price. very cute stylish and comfortable ",positive
" i bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites. my husband loved the way i looked in it. i must admit i was not that sure i wanted to buy something like this online...mainly because i am extremely picky with the quality of the things i buy...and also because i tend to be between sizes. but i ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me. i am very pleased with this seller. the order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition.. ",positive
" this shoe is great. it even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design. the only thing that i felt it lacked was extra comfort. i wear skechers and have done so for years and i have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet. it was a great deal that i just couldn't pass up and definitely worth the price : ",positive

" my husband the star wars fanatic loves them! very comfy ",positive
" i bought a couple of these bodysuits because i thought that they were quite amusing. the quality seems ok - i have not washed them yet so i can't comment on the color fastness - the dark blue seems a like it may fade.the first thing i noticed was that the bodysuits are very long. they are not the stardard length you get with gerber and carter's etc. the 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. the chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small. in the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal. i have to wait until my son gets here to decide if i will convert the smaller ones into tees. this would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right - hope this helps future buyers!!!

" i couldnt resist these shoes for the price...i've had good experience with bandolino branded shoes. i have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable. sure enough this pair of boots are very comfortable too! the color is a great burnished bronze that is a great neutral color to wear (plus metallics are in fashion again). the zip-up is easy and the calf is roomy. i'm very happy with them and would recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to spend 100's of dollars but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes ",positive
" i ordered this boot in a size 7 pewter. very cute boot and fits perfectly. very comfortable fit and feel. everyone who saw them wanted to know where i got them! simply darling boot ",positive

" this is my 2nd set of these type of curlers. the last ones stayed with me for three years. they are so good i stopped using the big home set and use these type daily. heat up fast great lasting curl (particularly for hard to curl fine hair) and don't even need to leave them in that long. would have given them a 5 - but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl. recommend getting or using a set of the old-fashioned wire clips that come with most non-travel sets if you want a smoother curl ",positive

" i ordered 3 products from dance now...none of them fit being at least one size too small. when i contacted dance now regarding this issue they told me that these shoes are sized for women. men need 2 sizes larger in their street shoe size. i found no reference to that detail on the amazon website. dance now representative told me it is referenced on their own website. but amazon does not make that fact known. so now i have 2 orders i have to pay shipping to dance now as well as their exhchange cost. i am a bit unhappy over this ",positive
" these were nice lightweight budget jazz shoes; however they do not fit the same as street shoes despite what the description says. my daughter wears a 2.5 in street shoes and i ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth. wrong! i have to return them and get her at least a 5 or maybe a 5.5. beware ",positive

" i love this bra! it is very comfortable and like the other reviewer said adds a whole cup size! cheaper than victoria's secret and well made ",positive
" beware: this bra will increase the appearance of your breasts a full cup size or more! the only draw back to acquiring this bra is slyly wearing it without family and co-workers knowing something's up. this bra is made from good materials. the cups are thick and smooth and the straps are study and comfortable. the liquid is ample but not noisy or lumpy. the cup fabric is itchy at first but a handwash in woolite will fix that. the only problem i have is that this bra doesn't push the breasts up to the cup! i prefer low-cut blouses and would feel more confident in a push-up design. otherwise it's a truly effective bra to give you non-surgical results ",positive
" these shoes are so cute and sexy! high heels makes a girl look so much longer and leaner! beware though if you've never bought naughtys i would go to a store and try them on first b4 buying online. i wear 8's in everything but these i wear 7.5. love them! ",positive
" these socks are absolutely the best. i take pilates classes and if it is hot your feet can slip off the mat. (not good in the middle of a side plank!)anyway these socks keep your feet planted and dry. one note; make sure not to order them big the idea is that they should be snug ",positive
" i wrote a rave review of these the day i got them. they were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug. however the next time i wore them for a longer session they got stretched out. my toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way. i put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance they were very uncomfortable. oh well. the concept is great but they don't really work unless you're doing very little movement. i wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job ",positive

" now this military style combat boot is one of a kind! it takes a while to break it in but after you will enjoy it! it looks so cool just looking at it never mind wearing it! its leather is tops! and it will last a life time! not water proof but great for jungle trekking! shines easy ",positive
" i bought this for my wife as a throw in with more expensive items because it was so cheap.i actualy forgot i even ordered it until it came in. i was pleasantly surprised when she modeled it for me. unlike a lot of stuff it looks exactly like the picture. she is a size small and it fit perfect. this not something most would wear out however as its insanly short which is great for me. the only thing that could improve this piece is a matching thong which is hard to find in lime green so maybe black would be a better choice if your trying to match things up ",positive
" this is an amazing product. i bought one of these along with another swaddle product that did not have the sleepsack feature. believe me there is no comparison. not only is the halo product made better and is more durable and holds the baby better but it is a 2 in 1 so that you can use it as a sleepsack by itself too. i trust this company because the product is recommended by the sids society. i don't have to worry that my baby is going to wriggle out of the swaddle because he is so secure in it.

" i purchased one of these cases for my sister-in-law and she liked it so much that i bought one for me too. i really like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a great carrying case for their ds lite. the vendor that shipped both of the cases did a great job of a quick shipment of a case that met all expectations. i would purchase from them again without hesitation ",positive
" this bag is perfect as a commuter bag on my bike. the cell phone pocket is very accessible and the bag is large enough to hold a change of clothes but not so large everything gets lost inside ",positive
" these are so great and keep my baby's feet warm. she even slept with them on with no problem. she's been a master at getting her socks off up until now. they also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails. she's chewing on the toes but i haven't seen any scuff marks yet so they are holding up very well ",positive
" robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use. they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off! we've tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off but not these. its worth it to spend the extra $$ on these shoes. and they're so well made they'll last for baby #2 ",positive

" this item was durable warm the right size as advertised and the right price. ",positive
" i didn't want to pay over $50 for a sports bra but i really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that. so i shelled out the dough for one and they were right! it fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. i ordered a different sports bra from champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. the champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure. more positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up it will fit!) and is super super comfortable. i do wish the price were less so i could buy a second but i'll have to put that in my budget. nevertheless as a wannabe runner with a large chest it was worth the investment in comfort and security ",positive
" pros: ultra fast delivery w/package tracking. item was shipped within a few hours of order. suit is in great condition and i like the color. cons: when they say grab bag...that means the suit may or may not look like the picture. mine turned out to be a blue stripped jammer...which is cool with me cause i actually wanted a blue jammer. just be prepared ",positive

" well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got. and i was not to be disappointed. they are really awesome!! they are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play. i even wear them to office sometimes ;) though after wearing them for a long stretch of time i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star. but they are worth every single penny i spent on them. if you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too look no furthe ",positive
" i love my soft and comfortable green robe that i received last year for mother's day! whenever i wear it i want to just relax with a magazine or watch tv and then fall asleep in it. the matching green slippers complete the feel and i really feel pampered. i never knew i could feel so good wearing a robe especially since i was not really a robe wearer before receiving this wonderful plush robe! this is such an excellent product and great gift!

" i absolutely love these shoes. i have a very high arch and i am a hard heel-striker. needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore. these shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches. however i did put an extra arch support insert in (did i mention i have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual crowding effect which was wonderful. i've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away. these shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box i've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. i plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to improve them and changes something. boy do i hate it when i finally find a shoe i like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me) i also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where i live. good service all around. hope this helps someone else.

" this is the absolute best sport bra made. i have been running 5 miles or more 5 times a week for over 20 years and once i discovered this particular model i have never switched back. the champion also lasts wash after wash without losing it's shape. unfortunately these great bras never seem to go on sale ",positive

" i had been on the look out for a mary jane pump that i could wear to work with pants and skirts. i finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. usually steve madden's run big on me so i got a size smaller and surprisingly it was actually too small. a half size up did the trick however. i love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. they're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe. my only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. i guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. also the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low and if you have wide feet it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter). despite those two small flaws i really like this shoe and find that i can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cute with skirts) ",positive
" we bought this for our 13 month old for christmas and she loves it. it is extremely soft. her favorite part is the cell phone that rings. the compact also squeaks. i love that it is all soft so that she cannot hurt herself with it. this is a perfect gift for a 1-year-old girl ",positive
" these are very good quality slippers comfortable & well worth the price. ",positive
" these shoes are durable comfortable and most importantly come in different widths. most other athletic shoe manufacturers apprarently don't make anything but d width. new balance does. for those of you complaining about width my guess is that if you size your feet correctly that problem will go away. i had always worn a 12d width until some gentleman at a mom and pop store sized my feet correctly for the first time in my life i found out i need a 13b. you may think you know your feet but you may not. as to comfort i can't complain. as to durability maybe they are a little stiffer but if that is what extends the life of these shoes over the others that is well worth it in my book ",positive

" these shoes are stunning original and over-the-top beautiful. i just can't understand the review regarding the point of the shoe being too pointy?? square-toe shoes are soooo late 90-s and these shoes are anything but mosquito hunters. they have a perfect narrow shape with an interesting mix of fabrics and a perfect toe for the current late decade of 2000. trust me with 117 pairs in my exploding new york closet these have ended up at the front. i'm picking up the black ones as i'm writing this. enjoy them....i know you as well as your better half will!

" good color visibility; nicely structured with warmth applicable to the unspeakable and inhuman frigidites of the amerikan north. the hat fits snugly and will evoke a positive commentary now and again. i have ordered maroon but will likely add some other color choice as the array is rather impressive. for an 100 % acrylic knit this is not a bad hat; the only problem perhaps being that it sucks up hairs very easily almost as if it were a hair-vacuum machine.

" they shipped these almost overnight. my daughter was a perfect little flower girl; no trips no blisters and they've held up great over the past 9-10 months with great durability for dance and lots of play. she was a size 10 at the time of the wedding but the shoes were a 9? her feet were fine. she can still squeeze into them now and she's an 11. very pleased. good value. these are the exact shoes ",positive
" now i'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be backpacks. i spent about two months searching for a new one until i finally came across this particular model. i'll start with by saying that i love this damn thing. it has plenty of space a whole bunch of extra cords that i suppose a hiker would use but i think just look nice and its very durable (which is a must for me since everything i own will take a beating). i'm telling you straight from the horse's mouth this backpack is worth the money. now if it only came as an 18 slot..

" these are the best windproof liner gloves out there. i freaked out thinking they had discontinued them because i thought they were made of gore windstopper and couldn't find any that said made with gore windstopper but actually it's polarguard windbloc. in any case when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing. these are totally windproof. extremely compact i don't think you can make them any thinner than this. good price. the only downside is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet. this is true of any windproof glove so it's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove. these weigh nothing (probably about an ounce each) and so i pack two or three pairs if i know i'll be getting them wet. i wear these ice climbing hiking mountaineering i have a pair i cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter and i wear them skiing inside of my mittens. these really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time. i haven't had cold hands skiing for two seasons now a problem that plagued me for years. i can't recommend these enough. -scott ",positive
" this is such a wonderful pair of gloves. they are light and easily portable. they can be folded and stored in one's pockets. they have features that enable use of one's index fingers and thumbs for fine operations such as turning minute knobs. the synthetic materials comprising these gloves also make them very protective against harsh weather (especially wind and rain). i am now able to run outside in icy wind despite the fact that my hands freeze more easily than anyone's elses ",positive

" most sneakers these days come in two varieties--they're huge athletic clod-hoppers for teenieboppers or they're white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies. this sneaker is the best compromise on the market today. it's youthful without being for the young. light-weight low-profile wide enough for a thick sock and it'll get you compliments everywhere you go. my first pair is in black and wow they are stylish. today i wore them out shopping and my back started hurting before my feet did. my one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed. i don't know if my shoes were missing that part or what but i found the sole to be hard and inflexible. they were still _comfortable_ but it wasn't like putting your feet on pillows or anything. if you do prefer a squishier footbed i recommend a thin insert so as not to squish your toes. i'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics--i'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out but i want these in every color ",positive

" i have to tell anyone who has lower back or foot pain to try a pair of merrells. when you try them on they feel comfortable but once you wear them for a week you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to). most of their shoes need no break in time. i own these in four different colors. my eldest daughter owns two pairs of these. i own more than 20 pairs of merrells i have been wearing these for years. the cool thing about them is when you see someone else wearing a pair it's like you're both in on a secret. you know you're walking in heaven ",positive

" at first i had my heart set on a different cloak but when it was no longer available i decided to go with this one. i am very pleased that i was not disappointed. this cloak looks and feels beautiful. it has a nice button closure at the neck and for those that are petite it is floor length. this cloak is just what i was looking for to add a last minute touch to my halloween costume. it is very comfortable and soft no itchy feel here ",positive

" these are my single favorite pair of underwear. not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish. i'm in the military so at first i thought thongs are not for real men but after wearing these i found they are and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize. i wear these for every day activivties sports work and leisure. there isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy. after wearing them for a while it's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it. if you've never owned a thong i think you should give these a shot.i definately recomend the 2xist y back thong ",positive

" to echo another reviewer: i am a heavy runner with high (semi-flexible) arches and a neutral stride running 20-35 miles per week. even though my strides are consistent in terms of length pronationand heal-to-toe gait i tend to have very heavy footfalls (being a former sprinter with muscular legs)and need a well-cushioned shoe. i am training for the boston marathon and have tried asics gel kayanos (the shoe designed for the clydesdale type runner) a pair of adidas adistars (the newest model is a very good shoe but didn't fit my wider foot properly) and some various pairs of new balance (least favorites of the bunch) but the mizuno wave 7's are by far the most natural feeling durable light-weight cushioned (without being bulky) shoe i have ever owned. i have now owned two of the wave creation 7's and a pair of the older wave creation 6's and put a lot of miles on these shoes: they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there. the gel kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but i found that they break down far to fast for distance running (and they are slightly heavy). that and the mizuno's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare. i am confident i could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference. i would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but i endorse it as the only shoe i will buy as long as the line continues.

" this is an excellent bra. in addition to being sexy it is also quite functional. it defines one's individual breast shape well and it offers maximum support. this particular bra comes in a pretty peach color and a beautiful black. chantelle bras are made according to french standards. you get a somewhat larger cup and the band size is not as long. still it's an excellent bra ",positive
" for years i wore asics. the gt the cumulus the nimbus. but i have to say if you're fan of any asics shoes named after clouds you should try the trigon 4. very similar but cheaper. also they did not joke when they called it the ride. it has a very smooth transition and insane cushion but a little more support than asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight. a big thumbs (toes?) up ",positive
" i have had a pair of these for several years; they were an incredibly lucky find. they're *extremely* comfortable better than many pairs of sneakers i've tried on. they've worn very well and i'd say they're well made: i've only had to replace the shoelaces once. a bit of polish some kiwi leather cleaner and protector for water and they're perfect. trust me you can walk for miles in them and they look great i think. a great purchase. if you're looking for a pair of dress shoes and nervous about buying them without trying them on well... my feet love them. don't know how far that will carry yours but there's my two cents. excellent ",positive
" i was very very pleased with the sailor outfit that included a very nicely made hat. it fit perfectly and was ahit with mom and dad upon seeing him at the airport on their arrival home from being deployed for 6 months. i found this same outfit about 25.00 more on other sites and so you can't do better on this buy ",positive

" these shoes are adorable and perfect for summer!! i love mine!! the only negative thing is that they are wide. i have normal size feet and ordered my regular shoe size. they fit length wise but are very spacey width wise ",positive
" these boxers are much nicer than the photos suggest. i was pleasantly surprised. i was trying to replace a pair i had accidentally washed in the washing machine (a no-no with this fabric). turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what i had originally purchased. i will probably be purchasing more. your wife will thank you for buying these. excellent quality and softer than satin. my only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes because it's made without a fastener. the idea is for a sleeker feel but it sacrifices security. love 'em anyway ",positive
" this is really a great item very comfortable. i would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose. great for the intended purpose though ",positive
" minimzer is correct i bought this bra in a 38ddd and it made me look more like a d or dd. it lifted and minim1zed my breasts. my only complaint is that the cup was rounded but the lining made a barely noticeable point. if you want your breasts to appear one or two sizes smaller then this is the bra for you.

" these are the coolest things ever made. i have been searching for a product like this forever and i could only find what used to be called &quot;lingerie helpers&quot; from the 50's or 60's (i think) which didn't quite do the job. no more buying those &quot;speciality&quot; bras that cost a bundle or those racerbacks that didn't quite fit right. i just put these on my favorite bra and don't even know it is there. now there is no excuse for me to ever see anyones bright pink bra straps peeking out from their shirts. i am just jealous that the woman who invented it is going to make millions and i am not!!!

" these are lightweight cotton thermals at a good price. i wear a large in most shirts and the large size for these fits snug especially after a wash which is how i like it for wearing as an undershirt. if you're buying for outerwear you might consider going a size larger. shipping wasn't 'amazon quick' but it was reasonable - about a week if i remember right ",positive

" my first pregnancy i tried several styles of belts most of which had a wide band in back. i am short have a short midriff and am overweight so wider belts would roll from the top down. i never had that problem with this belt. unfortunately this pregnancy i am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1x belt and the store i purchased it from is now closed. i was thrilled when i found this on amazon.com in a larger size. i recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed. the most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day. any time you start needing the extra support just slightly tighten the side straps. when you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight just loosen it up a bit. it's quick and easy to work with and if one side needs more support than the other just make that one side a bit more snug. it's awesome! i am a technology education specialist so i'm on my feet for many times 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs. i couldn't have survived even my first trimester without this belt. i raise it a little higher in the back so that i have complete lower back support and belly support. there were days when i forgot to wear my belt that i almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs. my legs would litterally give out from underneath me until i could rub and relax my lower back for a while. when you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is not a good thing. as long as i wore my belt i never had a problem. i strongly recommend this product ",positive
" i've been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and i've tried a lot of different nursing bras. i got this one several months ago and absolutely love it. i've been reasonably happy with the bravado line in general -- they hold up very very well stay comfortable and remain supportive over time-- but i just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one. i am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36 between b and c cups depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left often have one breast larger than the other. the 36c fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunchinglines or that nasty spillover when it's been too long between feedings. i wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly. the only other nursing bra that i've found that works as well under t-shirts is a mimi brand one that it costs just about as much but doesn't hold its shape for very long. basically this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last ",positive
" although i prefer jockey these hanes bikini briefs are great and i plan to order more. great value. i also bought fruit of the loom but in my opinion the hanes have a much nicer fuller cut the fruit of the loom are for youngsters with tiny butts. the reason i didn't buy jockey is they're too expensive ",positive

" i purchased this bag to take on a tour of greece and was pretty happy with it. i loved the size not to big and not too small and also the flatness of it. it was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible. the only problem i had with it is that when you wear it as intended accross your body the strap tends to rub at the neck so i had to keep adjusting it every five minutes. overall it was pretty good though ",positive
" i have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable and warm as well! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as i am a medium sized person (10-12) and it does seem to be a little large yet i wear it anyways. hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size ",positive
" every time i wear this tie it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were and when cartoons were cartoons. also working in a place with a lot of kids they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on. i've had this tie for 3 years now high quality and does not stain really easy (at least for me great quality). only downfall a little dated with a 32 cent stamp. kids don't notice and neither do most adults. worth picking up great price ",positive
" these boots look good with everything from jeans to skirts. because they are real leather i was expecting to have to break them in before they were comfortable - but it only took a few wearings before i could wear them all day with a lot of walking and no sore feet. didn't have any problem with them fitting my calves. i had that problem with other boots i have tried before. even if you don't consider the great price for all leather boots they are wonderful buy ",positive

" awesome handling while balling on this shoe. great grip on the court and i especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet ",positive
" great fit lightweight. these are very snug and allow for maximum mobility for quicker players who do a lot of cutting and fast movement. support strap is not too tight which is good and actually serves a purpose ",positive
" let me assure anyone who is even remotely thinking of buying these shoes..........do it! they are not only beautiful but as high as they are they are extremely comfortable. the detail is way more beautiful in person as they are on the website. my favorite shoe of the summer ",positive
" these socks are just what i was looking for a thin cotton blend to wear running. no bunching and they breath very well. the price and timliness of the order was also great ",positive

" i picked this sucker up for $30 from fred meyer after they made it clear that they had no other options available for charging my ipod from my computer (i was on vacation with no cord and a dead battery). i was only expecting it to last throughout the vacation but i've been using it ever since. i keep the car charger in my car with no extra cables to burden it and i keep the wall charger plugged into the wall. the cable retracts easily with a design much like that of a window blind (pull until you let go where it locks and then pull a bit more and let go to release). it's a small unobtrusive and incredibly convenient device for your ipod and at this price it's a steal. you'd pay two or three times this at some electronics stores for the wall charger or car charger alone let alone one that is so solidly constructed. no question -- if you own an ipod purchase this product. i was impressed enough to come and write this review -- perhaps you will be too ",positive
" i really like the speedo suit. i wear two swim suits the speedo and a larger drag suit over it. i've done this since my days on the swim team. the chlorine in the water tends to weaken the seams on my suit over time causing the drag suit to self-destruct eventually. having the speedo prevents any embarrassing moments. the fit and material is good and it holds up very well - this is the first replacement i've needed in years. if you are husky this might be a tight fit. i wear a 42-44 pant size and this is on the snug side.

" well constructed blazer. great color. you can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church. ",positive
" lovelovelove gerber products and these are no exception. great quality and they are so soft. the only thing is that the 0-3mths are a little small so you may want to consider starting with the 3-6 ",positive
" when i saw in a magazine that croc was making a style of their shoes that was not ugly i literally went the same day to dillard's to get a pair for myself! they are unbelievably comfortable - it feels like you're standing on clouds! the amazon listing doesn't show all the colors that they come in: light pink silver gold celery lavender light blue white black and fuschia. all the colors are really adorable and i had a hard time deciding! i have also had issues with sizing just as other reviewers have had. i usually wear a 7.5 wide in women's shoes but when i tried on the primas in an 8 they were ridiculously big and when i tried them on in a 7 they were a tad too snug. i really wish they made half sizes. i ended up buying the 7 even though it was a little small but i read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet that works like a charm: throw them in the clothes dyer for two minutes on medium heat then pull them out and while they are toasty warm immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour and voila they will now fit perfectly! grade: a- ",positive
" overall i'm happy with the skin. it fits the treo 700 very closely. this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo. my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. the 700w and p if you don't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes. well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p. not a huge deal just a slight annoyance. i'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow ",positive
" great service. the shoes were just what i wanted. i highly recommend these walking shoes because they are light weight and comfortable ",positive

" these boots are gorgeous! i got such an awesome deal on these boots; i searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them! i'll put one up here. they're comfy rich leather well made. i've always wanted frye boots ",positive
" these are by far the most comfortable boots i have ever owned! i am a huge fan of dansko clogs and these frye boots are just as comfortable and sturdy! they run a bit on the large side about a half size difference. you will love them!!!! ",positive
" i just got these and love them. my only complaint is that they pinch/are a little narrow even though i don't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes. the dark red color is a little deeper than the picture but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer. if you're gonna buy red shoes or any other colors available these are a great choice ",positive

" this mask attached using some velcro in the rear. i love it because it can be removed or put on without taking off my helmet! at first i had some problems with my glasses fogging up what i did was just pull it extra tight until the material was very snug with my cheeks. this drastically reduced fogging. i read on another products review that using some medical tape below the eyes would eliminate fogging (on a similar product) overall this has been a great buy. nic ",positive
" this bra fits very well (i found it fit very true to size) and offers great support. i'd much rather pay this price than the outrageous prices i've paid for sports bras in the past that have offered no where near the support. it has held up well while jogging. ",positive
" very smooth transaction and timely delivery. first time on-line shoe buyer. i tried those cute shoes on at a local shoe store and loved them but was not willing to pay high price for them. i saved about 35% by purchasing here! ",positive
" this is the best sports bra i've ever had! i show dogs for a hobby and was always aware that as i gaited the dog around the ring i was bouncing! now no more bounce and extreme comfort. i've had the bras for over 6 months now and they've held up well. everyone that i've recommended the bra to has had similar experiences ",positive
" this is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! i've been using lilypadz for about a month now and i must say that i love them. when i started breastfeeding my daughter i was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. i hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt they don't always absorb all the liquid and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. i assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because i didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed! i have to admit when i first saw them advertised i was skeptical. i didn't think they would stick i didn't think they would stay in place and i thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they'd leave a tacky residue on my breast. i hestitated for a couple of weeks wanting to try them but afraid that i'd spend all that money and end up disappointed. it was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night i decided i would risk it and order them. when they arrived i read all the instructions and was ready to try them out. now this is the embarrassing part... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using. for some reason i thought they meant take them out of the plastic container. i didn't realize that each lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic! when i first tried to put them on i actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out. (yes it was tough to do too!!) i was frustrated because they obviously didn't stick. i began to think that my fear of them not working was true. once i realized my stupid mistake i peeled them off the plastic and tried again. they stuck perfectly!! try and avoid having the problem i did.. make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes. i was immediately surprised at how secure they felt. i knew right away that i would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off. my next fear was removing them. i carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off. i was surprised that even though they stuck securely they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts. i was estatic! what a great product!! i have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons. however the pros greatly outweigh the cons. this is what i have found... pros ------ 1) attaches securely 2) removes with very little or no pain 3) no residue left behind on the breast. baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed. 4) protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads. (if you are feeling sore these are a huge help.) 5) secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra. 6) washable and reusable 7) invisible under snug fitting shirts. 8) when properly applied you will not leak 9) peace of mind 10) quick drying. after cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them (even if they are a bit damp still). no need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up. one pair will work and will always be ready to use. cons ------- 1) if not properly applied you might leak. you must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on. however even if you leak - it won't get on your clothes. instead it pools up around the nipple. it usually stays sealed. you just have to be sure to remove the pad drain the liquid rinse them and then reapply properly. one warning if you have an air bubble and you leak a lot it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you. this has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping. i leaked during the night woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if i had leaked on the other. my milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me. 2) if you own cats/dogs... keep them away from the pads when you aren't wearing them. they attract fur like crazy. if they do get furry its ok because it does wash off. its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort 3) takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public (vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra) but once you get the hang of it it woudn't even make the con list anymore. 4) i personally don't wear them every day. i'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little. i do wear them every night but during the day i'll occasionally wear my cotton pads so my skin can breathe. i'm afraid that i'll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if i wore them 24/7. i have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24/7. i'd say i wear them 3-4 times a week during the day. i will not go a night without wearing them though because i hate wearing a bra to bed. as you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit. the cons shouldn't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself. even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost. if you are like me and you are skeptical - don't be. these really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try. every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and i think they would make a wonderful and unique baby shower gift!

" i regained my sanity after getting these. sooooo much nicer than disposables ",positive
" ditto... i bought more of these. love the bibs with vinyl backings and absorbant terry fronts... really stops the soakings that happen with little ones who are teething. i bought these for a very low price that couldn't be beat. nice quality ",positive
" this is truly a beautiful bag! i got the classic dark leather which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures. the leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag's character. the leather is thicker than i expected; while it is by no means stiff it is not ultra-soft ultra-thin butter leather. this is leather that will age well and last for many many years. the zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather they'll be durable. (the other hardware is the same type of matte/antiqued silver.) the bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap. the cotton strap not only adds to the bag's uniqueness it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over. (i wear it across my chest like a messenger bag.) inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag. one is gusseted and works well for a cell phone (or items of a similar size) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards; i would have really liked for my ipod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick won't fit. the internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags i've tried because they were sized for laptops. i actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book. on the outside each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it. this creates 2 tall thin pockets where i keep pens; it would have been nice if one side didn't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items but that's not a problem for me. the entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket. on the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag. the magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong. there are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you don't have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag. i've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments. though the bag is pricey it is obviously crafted with care from high-quality materials. it also has a very distinctive look. i am very happy with this purchase and have already added another diongini bag to my amazon wish list ",positive

" tops and bottoms are very comfortable and able to keep me comfortably warm at +30f to +40f with regular dockers and long-sleeve cotton/polyester shirt. they are lighter and less bulky than their all-cotton longjohn cousins designed for similar temperatures. they also dry much more quickly. as with all longjohns i have found on the market in the past forty-plus years the tops are too short for anyone much taller than 6'(now) or 6'2 (back then). sadly i never see them listed in tall sizes and as always before i have to tuck in the tops or hike up the bottoms over and over and over...to make sure my waist is protected.

" even if you could never see yourself wearing this. go ahead and get it anyway. this is great for under the football helmet & for under the motorcycle helmet. feels good on your head. i have even seen wrestlers wear these under headgear so it must be good for that too. keeps your head dry. i also wore this under my mask when volunteering @ a haunted house ",positive
" i have had these boots for one month winter in alaska. i have been climbing a 1000 foot elevation trail that is about one mile long. it is winter the temperatures range from 5f to 25f and the trail is a mixture of ice and snow with a few knife edge ridges of ice. i am wearing one pair of medium weight smartwool socks and no gaters. to date my feet are always warm and dry in these boots. lacing alone has prevented snow from coming into the boots. the lateral support is excellent and better than i expected. the fit is excellent and i have no slipping inside the boot (yeah!!!). for my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive but they hold well. my four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside...i think because of the shape of the sole at the instep (so i have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel). light weight but strong and sterdy so far. felt completely broke in right out of the box. not a hint of any blisters going uphill or down. i would highly recommend them so far ",positive
" i have never been into full rim hats. i needed one for the work and rest i do so i gambled on this. i am very happy that i did. it fits perfectly and already i have been through a twenty degree difference with rain and being a glasses wearer i can say i am definitely pleased. i recommend this hat for anyone looking for this type of product for any reason ",positive

" these are the only semi-affordable bikini briefs i've found that are actually designed with a pouch making them the most comfortable on the market (of all the brands i've tried that is). unfortunately they're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets and you'll probably have to purchase them from an amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges but what can i say. i guess it's worth it. the briefs also run about a size small. i have a 31 waist but the mediums are too small. ",positive
" these shoes are so light that sometimes i forget i have them on. they are so comfortable than i don't want to take them off. i have to walk a lot every day and i am not kidding when i said that any other pair of shoes make my feet sore after a few hours of use but these shoes do the job to perfection. i highly recommend them ",positive

" i am technically a 32jj (per some lingerie store lady) but have worn 34 dd and ddd since high school (i'm 27 now) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra (33 weeks pregnant today). i tried the medela seamless underwire full fit nursing bra in a 34g and 34h. this one is the most supportive but is an underwire (which after 8 hours i can't wait to take off - and i've always been a committed underwire wearer) and the h cup fits but i'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk really comes in. i also tried the fancee free foam support soft cup nursing bra which i also got in a 34g and 34h is not the most supportive but is comfortable (i wear this one to bed around the house etc.). so regarding the goddess bra - i just got a 34g and yes the cups are a little big which i'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts. not to mention the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple (i've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be). my favorite part is the back portion which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others. it is also pretty supportive maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the medela - but steps above the fancee free. i will likely buy one more g and an h in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because i finally found what i'm looking for. i'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in. this bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from amazon this is the first review i was ever compelled to write. hope you find the same success with this bra too. good luck ",positive
" this bra is the best nursing bra i have found. it is very supportive and comfortable. i like that it gives you the same support as an underwire bra but without the hard wire digging into you. it holds up very well in the wash. i would definitly recommend this bra to anyone that has a hard time finding bras to fit them.

" great boots. perfect for playing in the rain. great quality. i bought one size bigger that current size so they would last at least two rainy season. no problems for the kiddos to adjust to bigger size. we previously had the frog boots and they are still in great shape to be hand-me-downs ",positive

" i wear this shirt waiting tables and i reccomend it to anyone. when washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings. the larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms. i only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color but still an excellent shirt ",positive
" this is my favorite for lap swims. reasonable modesty but not baggy. you'll move through the water with ease with minimum suit slippage. if you are not looking for a tan get this one! ",positive
" i bought two of these as a gift for my husband. he'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed. these were ready to go right out of the box no assembly required took up less space in his closet than the 3-4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from. the cushioned tie hooks ensure the ties will not slip off and also that they will not be damaged. a breeze to organize his vast tie collection. and he's loving this product ",positive

" i found that these shorts do run a little bit small in size so make sure you give yourself an extra size up to make sure there is adequate room to move freely. follow the care label for the first wash or two until they get broke in because the shorts are bit stiff at first due to their scotchgaurding. tip: make sure you wash them before you wear them. i would recommend these shorts for most anyone who is looking for durability comfort and/or needing a professional look in the garments they wear. note: if you are looking for extra pockets go the dickies cargo route. these do not have any extra pockets ",positive
" i still love this bra! it's great for casual wear sleeping etc. it does solve the back fat problem however there is no lift and separate for me. i'm going to try the underwire version of this bra to see if it helps. it is an extremely comfortable bra that feels great on! i bought a l for the band size but there's just not quite enough coverage for my ds ",positive

" this case is so cute and matches my green ipod perfectly. i read other reviews that said it leaves little black fuzz on the ipod but i haven't had that problem. the belt clip works great with this and feels very secure. the other review said the cut-out for the wheel is off a little and i guess she is right. looking at it you can see just slightly that the wheel isn't centered but it is completely accesible and i have no trouble using it. overall i love this case ",positive
" i bought this for my husband and am so impressed. nice and thick and incredibly soft and huggable. i have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores. the attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise. sturdy shipping box and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required. there was even a hand-written thank you note included. i am more than satisfied. ",positive
" the megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes. it has a nice feel to it. the bathrobe is made of japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100% cotton. cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable. i purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected. overall i am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if i had the choice to do so. ",positive
" this is a heavy/thick robe i expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly. i am 5'8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but i don't even notice now. the comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed. i cant speak on durability as i've only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel. i got the brown color and i love it i feel like grisly adams in this thing..

" my son's favorite color is orange but finding an orange lunch bag this year was a tough find until i found this lunch kit. it is perfect: high qualtiy great price fast delivery. i am completely satisfied and will definately order again next year ",positive
" at first i was bugged by how sticky this was but boy did it work! they gave me 1/2 ounce tube in the hospital (and charged me $9 for it but that's another story!) it moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing and doesn't bother baby a bit. take my advice bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over-charged!

" i pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running. i not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but i ran two half marathons and the nyc marathon with this exact sneaker. when they became worn from the wear and tear? i bought another pair - exact one. these sneakers lasted me half a training season plus the marathon. not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles. i highly recommend them. and the color is fun too ",positive

" i missed my late 80s over the knee suede boots which is why i got these. they are great! the only thing that could be much improved are the soles and heel. they are very thing. i'd wear them out in a day. i had to have them resoled. but the ammazon price was so good it was still a steal.

" this was exactly what my husband had admired in macy's. i paid $25 more for the convenience of having it delivered to my home without my husband's knowledge. he is thrilled with the jacket ",positive
" my 9 year old nephew told me he wanted under armour for christmas. i had no idea what he was talking about. i asked - under arm deoderant? undershirt? i was ever the un-cool aunt for not knowing what he wanted. i found out that 3 of my friends experienced the same thing. ;) the shirt runs very tight and even though my nephew is smaller for his age the large just barely fit him. he asked for a second one for his birthday (and so did my sister so she could get the shirt off of him and wash it). the kid loves it and if he gives it 5 stars so do i. ",positive
" these boots are comfortable but they don't keep my feet very warm in cold weather. they have an unusual pattern that gets a lot of compliments and goes with almost every color in a wardrobe. the heel height is perfect. also i can tuck my jeans into the boots - an added bonus ",positive
" it's october 8th 2006. the detroit tigers have just defeated the new york yankees to advance to the american league championship series. people counted the tigers out. everyone thought the yankees would walk into comerica ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the tigers have produced all season long. nope. didn't happen. the tigers won 95 games this year. no one thought the tigers advancing this far was possible but when you have excellent stars such as magglio ordonez curtis granderson ivan rodriguez marcus thames craig monroe and kenny rogers you can't lose. the manager jim leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the tigers as a team and give them much-needed direction. he was probably the main reason they won so many games. the tigers are now a team everyone can love- not just detroit fans. tv stations are now playing tigers games again and reminding people that yes the tigers are still around. the fact that the tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team but beating the yankees last night was solid proof the team is back and threatening. proof that the tigers can hang with the big boys. the celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful. everyone on the team lifted jim leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago and obviously still support their home team. it got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience and they enjoyed it! even a cop wanted to be sprayed. the celebration supposedly lasted an hour. this vintage crest t-shirt should proudly be worn by you. i want you to take a trip to new york city wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud loyal detroit tigers fan you are. the days of watching them lose game after game are finally over. long live the tigers. make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the tigers had in the season of 2006. you need to wear orange if you live in the detroit area.

" i initially recieved my order very quickly within a week in fact. however it was the wrong size and i had to send it back to them. it turned out it was another 6 weeks before i got back the correct fitting corset. the good news is with my wedding dress it is perfect however if you are planning a wedding make sure you get this item way ahead of time in case there are any issues with sizing or back ordering ",positive

" finding sleepwear that has enough support for lactating large-breasted women is no fun but this dress is pretty good. what this will not give you is any kind of coverage. if you're ok with people seeing you with major cleavage then this is fine. if not just wear it to bed--not in the hospital or as i see some women do--out of the house. yikes! i think i'd be arrested ",positive

" the denim on these jeans is lightweight and the touch of stretch renders them super-comfy not confining like some stretchy jeans can be. they're almost as comfortable as my sweats and there are some weekends when i just live in these! true to size and i didn't have the shrinking issue another reviewer seems to have experienced ",positive
" i recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended asics shoes to me. this is my first pair of running shoes and i am very pleased with it. the shoes were very comfortable from the day one. one comment that i have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front. i have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe. i worked out fine for me however because i had purchased 1/2 size longer than what i usually wear. overall i am very happy with this pair and would recommend it ",positive

" great leggings....i love the feel of these....thicker than the regular cotton/lycra leggings and they hold you in nicely.....one thing i like about danskin is the waist elastic is not tight it just rests on your waist. it's extremely comfortable. gusseted cotton crotch is also a plus...i wear these to yoga pilates on hikes with my dog and just about everywhere else. oh and they look much more expensive than the cotton leggings......i even wear them in 90 degree weather. i just can't get enough of them......i have always appreciated danskin quality just machine wash and dry and off you go....

" i got custom fit for this bra at nordstrom's and i am so happy that i purchased it - among others that day. i had lost 55 pounds and was looking to update my image and had gone through about 4 bra sizes on my way down. hands down this was the best purchase - even better than the $65 i spent on the le mystere bra. it is unbelievably comfortable and since i am a light 34c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect c. plus it gives me a bump and just the right amount of cleavage. i can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top. one thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since i am 5' 1 and a size 2 that works well for me as i am pretty small framed. it took a bit to get used to them being so out there in front. so if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you. i love it so much that i now have this in all 3 colors and 2 of the bare color as i am very fair skinned. ",positive
" i'm a big guy. heck i'll just admit; i'm a fat guy. however i am also simply large-framed (broad-shouldered barrel-chested). i got the largest size possisble to accomodate my stomach and my large chest (largest available is a chest measurement of 60 my chest is 58) and while the coat looks pretty good on me the shoulders are extremely constricting and i have heard the seam in the back pulling if i move my arms too quickly or too far. if you have unusual proportions like me i reccomend biting the bullet and getting a tailor-made coat elsewhere. still though the coat is quite warm and looks pretty nice on me so if you are of relatively normal dimensions you can add a star to this review when considering a purchase ",positive
" this boonie hat is collapsible yet has a firm rim. chin-strap is attached to keep it where it belongs in high winds. this is the hat that will conceal you in the woods but gets noticed about town. the digital pattern is impressive can often times is a conversation piece. i wear it almost every day and it's my favorite piece of headgear ",positive

" the glasses were in excellent condition they were exactly what i expected plus more (they sent them in a glasses case which was a bonus to me. this was an excellent seller ",positive
" i am picky about the kind of sock i put on me & my son's feet. his feet have been sized as extra wide (!!) and these socks fit wonderfully in his size without being stretched tight. i love the high cotton content & the cushioned soles. these are well made socks & i will be buying from this brand when it's time for the next size up ",positive
" trans. was great. love the shirt!! i know it's a lot for a t-shirt but i had to have it!! ",positive
" a really nice looking t-shirt that was made to show an archeological dig revealing an unearthed artifact (a gibson les paul guitar). i've had nothing but positive remarks about it every time it was worn. i'll probably order another because something this good usually goes fast. a really good led zep shirt is hard to find and this is one. highly reccomended. 5 stars.
