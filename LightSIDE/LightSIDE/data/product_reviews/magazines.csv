" let me first say i am one of martha stewart's biggest fans! i have enjoyed msl magazine for years and loved the format of the old show (the new one is taking awhile to get used to). i jumped at body and soul when it first came out but have been repeatedly disappointed in the obvious exclusion of anything male in the articles. not to mention the articles on relationships and love have never mentioned same sex partners which i find totally unacceptable unforgivable and just plain stupid from a marketing standpoint. why exclude men and gay people? i have also noticed there are no ads from advertisers marketing to men either. most if not all of the articles are nothing more than new age pablum either borrowed or stolen from much better magazines such as alternative medicine. don't waste your time or money on this one. this isn't even good enough to line my cat's litter box ",negative
" this is not the health magazine you'd expect from martha stewart -- it's extremely heavy on advertisements (45% at my rough count) and really cluttered and just not good. the recipes are interesting if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin-hydration ads ",negative

" oh those were the days when i was in college reading my first issues and then subscribing. there were great things to be found in its pages columns by brian crozier russell kirk erik von kuenhelt-leddhin (sp?). the great struggle with the soviet union was going into a critical stage. it seemed nr was so on the right track. and it was wonderful to read at least from about 1979 to 1983. but then it became for a while duller. it had some periods of recrudescence such as under the editorship of john o'sullivan. but when rich lowry took over nr really began to dumb down (nothing personal mr. lowry). but what i've really discovered of late is how badly the neo-con agenda has sort have taken over the magazine. we've got in the 50th anniversary issue a call by midge dector to rally the country to our illegal and immoral war in iraq. really something has happened to the magazine a sinister force has entrenched itself there. what is that force? well go to come-and-hear.com and you will begin to learn part of the picture especially when you read the material by elizabeth dilling. i would also recommend paul findley's they dare to speak out which details the israeli lobby's domination of our congress. nr was once a courageous conservative magazine but now it has been heavily tainted by the influence of a terrible thing. wfb should know better and maybe he does. if he doesn't then he should pick up neo-conned! and neo-conned again! and then he should listen to tony martin's talk given to the ihr on a certain group's tactics deployed to suppress free speech. what has inspired me to write this review is wfb's recent column on the incarceration of david irving. it ends in a disgusting gloating. wfb has fallen into an evil trap and so has the magazine he used to run. what has happened to the christian faith of people like buckley? he now seems lost and terribly afraid of offending that supposedly saintly interest group...and you mr. lowry come on now: read widely and deeply and don't be afraid of reading the talmud and about the israeli lobby. once you do maybe you'll develop the strength to think outside the box. we're going to have to do that if we want anything but the bleakest future for mankind and the planet.

" i got this magazine as a gift starting a few months back. i really can't say i'm impressed. admittedly i'm much more left leaning than this conservative (sometimes very very conservative) magazine. dispite my bias i can still recognize good writing and well made points - this magazine generally lacks both. this isn't to say that i've never seen a good point or anything they're just fairly rare. if you want to read a well-written well-argued conservative mag this isn't it ",negative
" this magazine just dares people to pick the most boring pretentious or ostentatious feature within any given issue. town & country is an extremely old money venture and while it does have some good and useful articles (and lovely advertisements for things that virtually nobody can afford) much of the magazine is essentially centered on a very elitist worldview that grows very tiresome rather quickly. town & country was initially recommended to me because of ostensibly good coverage of travel and architecture two areas i have great interest in. as an applicable aside when i read a list of tips in the offshoot town & country travel publication on ways to ease the stress of long range flights i realized there was a reality check due when one of the first tips was to always fly in first class ignoring the fact that the vast majority of readers would rather buy a car with what a typical first class ticket to europe or asia costs. as i mentioned there are some good articles and there are occasionally better and more useful offshoot publications like town & country travel that are eminently more readable (although they still insist on advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes on the coast etc.) i will say that the photography is always good and you can believe that if it appears here that it is the finest and most fashionable available: hyacinth bucket would no doubt like to be seen reading this magazine. despite having occasionally worthwhile features i find town & country to be excessively pompous therefore i recommend finding another publication focused on whatever area of interest you have whether it is fashion society or travel.

" yes t&c is the oldest continually published magazine in the usa and it's their 160th anniversary. however i see little reason to celebrate. why? because i fail to see how it's really improved over the years. nowadays this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the nouveau riche. back in the day when it was a true high society magazine there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts literature and culture. it was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about bling bling so has this magazine. there are far too many adverts for so-called luxury goods for my tastes and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new power base they insist on using only thin 20-something models who probably can't afford the clothes they are modeling! articles wise they are starting to sound more like glamour or cosmo than the erudite publication i used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago. yes t&c has changed with the times...but these are not good times if that is the case. it's too bad ",negative
" i received this subscription as a trial and found it one of the most boring publications that i have ever read. by the last few issues that i got i wasn't even looking at the pictures anymore. there are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life which were very materialistic. at the end of every issue there were pictures of &quot;real-life&quot; wedding announcements. perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper but it struck me as out of place in a magazine ",negative
" great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it's free - but not worth your money to own. i bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here. oh once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine but not consistently. the home section isn't that inspirational either. go for it if it's free but if it's not don't buy it ",negative

" this magazine is great just for keeping the spirit. it's filled with many success stories. but hardly any of those success stories include the details that led them into success. it's also extremely geared towards franchising. every other article and every other ad is about franchising. i have a one year subscription and at this point i'm bored. i'll keep the subscription but it's highly unlikely that i will renew next year. *** though one should check out their web site at entrepreneur.com. you will find that it is the total opposite of the magazine and will prove to be a great wealth of information ",negative

" my mom was a subscriber to newsweek for years and i'd flip through her copies. most of the material is friendly towards the powers that be (although not friendly enough according to the review by the soldier who thinks the editors should be in jail. so much for protecting our freedoms). anyway since newsweek is beholden to big business advertisements it won't do much to rock the boat that our corporate mafia owns. if people are interested in more honest more critical views of the political and economic system that is causing so much devastation in the world (the neoliberalism of the us empire and other wealthy nations) then i'd recommend z magazine. i'll never forget finding my mom on the floor devouring it's articles on a range of issues the corporate media marginalize. z also publishes articles and interviews with the most-cited living author on the planet noam chomsky (another figure i'm sure the us soldier thinks should be in jail. although chomsky recently spoke at west point. so even the military is waking up to the hard truths he brings).

" i decided that i had to write a review about newsweek this morning after i came across yet another biased over-hyped cover story. this particular one is entitled rethinking the marriage crunch and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman's chances of getting married later in life. this was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around and neglected to have any on this occasion. i really think another reviewer's comparison to people is quite apt but newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue. two years ago we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning infidelity chic. yes it seems according to their sources spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue without even a hint of contradiction that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before. i find the magazine to be [...] as they offer opinion instead of news; theirs is a mission of persuasion. overall there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool.

" first off i usually just stick to rating & critiquing movies. but every time i see an ad on this website for this time/warner (or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week) rag-mag i start to see red. entertainment weekly which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash. back in the summer of 89 ew was released and after i read a few issues i decided to subscribe. i was instantly hooked (the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the saturday before it would hit regular newstands) & i liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies music t.v. and video (that was later added in the mid-90's). the problem with the magazine started in the late 90's. i started to notice that ew would cover a big movie or event that hadn't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales. i also hate the damn lists that ew comes up with. the latest entitled the top 100 most memorable movie lines was a joke. these lists have always annoyed me because i feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking. the other & most important thing i noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review. case in point a few weeks ago i picked up the latest issue in which the movie catwoman had been reviewed (i wasn't to sure if it was gleiberman or shwarzbaum that critiqued it). i first logged onto rotten tomatoes.com to see what percentile catwoman recieved from the nation's critics. out of roughly 115 reviews catwoman only got 10% of the good reviews while the rest trashed it (a film needs at least to get a grade of 60 - 65% in order to place it as a fresh or good movie). that makes catwoman the worst reviewed film so far for 2004. yet ew gave the film a b. what erkes me even more is that catwoman is released by warner bros. the same company that owns the rights to the harry potter films the lord of the rings trilogy & yes the wb owns entertainment weekly. is warner bros. trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular & lucrative magazine's? i'm not the only who has seen this developement. people have written in saying that there is favoritism among warner products that are reviewed in the magazine. ew of course hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews possibly in fear of being fired (they will deny that also). my only question to the reviewers at entertainment weekly is whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it? or better yet what's it like to stand on a democratic podium?

" home business magazine is a publication aimed at those members of the general populace who either already own a home based business or who have an active interest in the subject and would like to pursue it further. this magazine contains articles relating to all facets of home business ownership from the initial setup all the way through to the payment of taxes at year end. i read several different business magazines and many of them have to do with entrepreneurship. home business is the only one i read that is specifically devoted to starting a business in the home and unfortunately it has many flaws that prevent it from being the enjoyable and informative read that it otherwise could be. probably the most annoying feature of this magazine is the articles themselves and their tendency to be written in a list- type format rather than in a user- friendly way. i realize that people like lists but home business takes this a little too far. it makes the magazine seem callous and unfriendly- something you would consult in the same way you would an almanac. for example it is common to find a one page article with a title like effective ways to design a newspaper ad or how to obtain quick financing. in each instance these articles will have a short opening consisting of a paragraph or two followed by a numbered listing of different methods/suggestions to solve the problem or answer the question. this makes the magazine read more like a reference guide than a piece of reading material. another thing that is annoying about this magazine is the endless advertising. not only does it get out of hand it also includes all sorts of ads that emphasize money- making schemes and other similar material. advertisements with titles like really lazy guy's incredible little secret idea can make you rich free $9.95 report shows you how to make a fortune and six figures in six months clutter the pages of this magazine with get- rich quick garbage that everyone knows is unlikely to return even the cost of the introductory package. some parts of this magazine are more bearable than others and it's this handful of positive attributes that prevent me from giving this magazine a one- star rating. i like some of the success stories because they depict ordinary people who have succeeded at making a living with a home- based business. but even here the stories are inconsistent. some are educational in nature while others have little valuable information to share. and to make matters worse they are far too short- usually covering only one- half page each with a large advertisement taking up the space at the bottom of each page. speaking of the advertising this magazine wrote the book on advertisement excess. advertisements cover about 75 percent of the pages in each issue and it is rare to see even two pages in a row without some sort of advertisement. the ads are posted everywhere often right in the middle of an article and they distract greatly from the already limited enjoyment of the magazine. this magazine is assembled together in such a way that it reads like a collection of articles taken from people in different parts of the country that were shuffled around and published in one magazine. in other words this magazine has no continuity to it. it's like taking short articles from different business newspapers around the usa and then piecing them together into one magazine. starting a home- based business is a goal that many people set for themselves and there is always a need for some good timely information when you find yourself in this situation. home business unfortunately doesn't perform its mission very well. if you dig deeply enough you can find a few good articles. but the majority is too impersonal and too shallow (not to mention smothered in advertisements) to make this magazine worth the trouble.

" like where's waldo it seems every issue must have at least one if not several mies van der rohe daybeds. while this is admitedly a classic piece of furniture one gets the impression that there are a gaggle of designers telling their clients you have to have one of these they're what's in! most of the features in metropolitan home suffer from the same fate; dreary antiseptic homes with the same dreary interiors that obviously were foisted upon gullible uninformed clients by designers who know how to make an easy buck. modern equals of course a mies van der rohe daybed (notice how many times it shows up in this review?) otherwise you get month after month of 1970's florals faux louis the whatever tables. even using feature extraction wading through the dreck and finding something useable for your own purposes it's painful to look through this magazine. if you really want ideas for making your house reflect you trust yourself and what you like and if you do like mies van der rohe daybeds by all means get one. just don't plunk one in your sun room because you were told it's trendy. if you like the modern style look up the works of hans wegner and peter hvidt and go from there; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years of hard use by real families and is sturdy as well. maybe you want a house where nobody is allowed to set foot in any of the rooms and amounts to a bad hodge-podge of styles that all seem a bit busy and bumpy. for everyone else think about the things you'd like to see if you walked into a room save your money and skip this magazine ",negative

" i echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here: the magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week. how many times is a reader going to see no talents such as jessica simpson lindsay lohan the tom cruise-katie holmes joke and the most overrated overhyped people of all time brad pitt and angelina jolie on the cover and not get tired of it? it's nice to know what's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week? can you say overkill? i'm glad i never got a subscription to this magazine. i picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because i was so sick and tired of reading about overrated overhyped and glorified b-movie actors and actresses who were lucky to be in one successful movie and haven't done anything of value since. i picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever. don't waste your time or your money. - donna di giacom ",negative
" people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life. instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them. does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j.lo is engaged (in order to get on the cover of another magazine) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns ",negative
" laptop magazine focuses on laptops pdas and wireless computing. laptop magazine seems like it's trying to be both technical and exciting; however it lacks the objectivity of pc magazine and the deep enthusiasm of wired. thus it reads like a series of infomercials where each &quot;article&quot; paints a rose-colored view of each technology and the vendors products followed by paid ads of the same vendors portrayed so happily in the text. their conclusions all seem predetermined: new technology is better ",negative

" spin is an accurate name for something like this -- a lot of hype for an innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine. if rolling stone is the dirty old geezer of rock magazines then spin is the teenager who tries hard to convince you he's cool by name-dropping the strokes. spin covers some of the same turf as rolling stone and blender but less lasciviously -- lots of coverage of popular bands. some of them are quite good -- the hives for example or indie newcomer steve burns (who quit his job on blues clues after hearing a flaming lips album and reinvented his life as a rocker). unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands are hot at the moment and then overemphasize them again -- as well as tacking them up in whatever coolest/best lists they chalk up for the year/decade/century/history of rock. indie cred is maintained by a few half-page articles on potentially hot bands like the comas and metric but this info is halfhearted. it's like they're reluctant to tear themselves away from articles on better-known bands regardless of talent. the writing however has that certain affliction that a lot of major rock magazines have: the need to be cool. their writers always are trying to be funny but rarely come across that way. it seems silly and strained like a soccer mom wearing a spandex tube dress. even the cd reviews are mediocre. however one recent highlight is dave eggers' columns -- witty funny and a little bit skewed. in fact they are often the best things in the entirety of the magazine. one of the problems is the emphasis on stuff in hollywood. scarlett johanssen is a wonderful actress yes. but she doesn't sing nor has she appeared in a music-based movie -- jack black yes scarlett no. and what is up with party coverage on tv starlet mischa barton and mtv couples? check out sublimely indie mags like chord filter under the radar and the online kludge for in-depth looks at some worthy bands. as for spin? it's still trying to convince us it's cool but eggers is the only regularly cool thing about it ",negative

" interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it's not quite what i expected. with a title like interview i read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews. it turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine but it's not the only one. there is substantial space given to fashion movies and other areas too. some of these columns are worth an occasional look but they failed to grab my attention. the writers seem to play it safe and that includes the interview section. they don't ask many daring or controversial questions. they keep it simple asking questions about an entertainer's latest album or movie without delving much into their personal lives. interview has many general annoyances. my greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents. about half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads with fashion liquor beer and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue. the ads are everywhere with the majority in the front pages of each issue. the table of contents is buried and i find this very frustrating. the contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page then a few pages later proceeds to the remainder of the contents which is the regular monthly features. what's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents. it varies from one issue to the next falling somewhere in the first half. interview also varies greatly in length. some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long. the shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way minus any metal. this magazine centers on entertainers fashion music and the like. you won't find any interviews with politicians businessmen etc. interview sticks strictly to entertainers and that includes the regular monthly columns. you won't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry. you will find only articles about the stars themselves. interview's only saving grace is the photography. it would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing. but in many ways the photos are overemphasized and there isn't enough substance to the magazine. the articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material. overall interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material. my subscription was free and i'm thankful that it was. besides a few nice photos for clothing there isn't much to make this magazine worth the cost.

" flipping through the pages of writer's digest at a local bookstore i found some of its content to be particularly useful and interesting especially those on the trade of writing that could benefit the novice writer. so i decided to subscribe to the magazine and it was only then that i realise that problems do persist in this seemmingly wholesome and helpful magazine. since i have subscribed online directly through wd's website in jan 2005 i have received only a few issues. in the first few months for almost half a year i received no issues at all. it was only later then when i e-mailed them did they manage to get some issues through to me. the annoying thing is that even though i have e-mailed wd a few times on this problem they would reply apologetically saying that they will extend my subsription. how does this tackle the root of the problem? if they could not have assured its overseas subscribers a consistent service they should not have offered an 'overseas subscribers' option. ironically i received their letter asking for a renewal of my subscription recently with my home address clearly printed on the front of the letter. logistic problems aside the magazine does have its plus points. in the issues there are useful tips for writers not simply on the craft of writing but also on the business and spiritual aspect of the writing process as well. occasional issues also features insights into the lives of authors to give us an idea of how and where they work their opinions on life and the areas from which they derive their inspiration. all this from a range of authors from a range of genres. essentially the business of writing is also not left out. however the magazine is not one fraught without problems. the problem with wd is that the information presented to readers is too limited and scattered. each article though containing valuable tips on writing does not have enough depth to really improve the work of authors if they are really implemented. in addition because of its range it also does not provide what some writers really want consistently which can be a waste of time for them to read if they are subscribers. sometimes it does seem that the magazine is purposely limiting the information that they give to readers in order to encourage further buying of future issues. this for example can be seen in the amount of publishers' addresses that they offer. at most each specific article on a particular topic contains on average 7-10 addresses. there is nothing wrong with this but why would an author want to waste his time to have bits and pieces of such information when he can just purchase a writer's market collection of publishers(and agencies) addresses collected into one? and ironically again the same company does publish a 'writer's market' collection which is of excellent quality annually. that said the same problem - the lack of information and depth is also seen in the advice and tips it gives as well. to make matters worse every issue is usually cluttered with a plethora of advertisements that can be frustrating to readers at times. writers want to organise their time and information not add on to it. if you want are thinking of subscribing to wd do consider the alternatives that are currently available. writing is a craft that requires more common sense and acumen than many would like to think. however if you are not particularly concerned with little information fed to you in slower dozes or are not too worried about a little more untidiness in your life than this magazine might be for you. but do your research first ",negative
" writer's digest puts out a lot of great resources for writers. the magazine ain't one of them however. for starters about half of the magazine is ads - mostly for other writer's digest products. one you get past paying $19.95 a year for what's essentially a brochure you'll notice that most of the articles don't apply to you. most writers stick to one genre yet the magazine focuses on all aspects of writing - fiction poetry business writing editing non-fiction etc. if you're working on a biography of j. edgar hoover do you need to look at an article on poetry in the stlye of ee cummings? i'll take no for $600 alex. so now you're down to about 10 pages that might be relevant. well let's start chipping away at that: the letters about grammar questions are a waste: if you have a question about affect versus effect would you write to a magazine and wait a month or two or would you pick up your style guide and have an answer in less time than it took for you to read this sentence? thought so. (furthermore the idea that someone would write to a magazine with a question like that is so incredulous one has to wonder if the questions aren't just submitted by staff members in an attempt to fill space like i used to do when i was the news editor at my college paper.) writer's digest does review software and other technology that might be useful to writers. my favorite was when it reviewed microsoft word. thanks - i'm sure most readers had no idea about the monopolistic word-processing program. to be fair some of the reviews are useful although you can get better information just by looking up the product on amazon.com and reading the reviews there. if you're going to writer's digest for market information you'd be better served elsewhere: the annual writer's market publication has all the markets and is more thorough whilst the writer's market website has all that information and is up-to-date. your money would be better spent on those two products. about the only articles i have found useful are the profiles on authors and how they have succeeded. there you have it: two or three pages an issue that are useful. if you're trying to get your work published writer's digest has several other products that are a better investment than its magazine: go with the annual writer's market book the website and pick up a style manual of your choosing (chicago is the best). don't waste your money on this magazine ",negative
" reason once had two things going for it. it articulated principled libertarianism and it was a consistently interesting magazine. now its ideology is fuzzy; certainly not consistently libertarian. it is also dull and aimless often badly written. case in point: the current issue as i write includes a defense of the fda by a writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians and who works for an organization that supports a prohibition on the sale of nutritional supplements as well as promoting state assaults on the tobacco industry. the old reason would never have published such a piece. nor would reason have previously published ronald bailey's article advocating mandatory health insurance. bailey also supports the iraq war and psychiatric coercion. a bright spot continues to be the writing of jacob sullum ",negative
" while waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month (july 2005) i read through what i thought would be the familiar redbook magazine of the past. instead i was shocked to come across a new sexual advice section in which the explicit techniques for giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out was described. another article within this section explained how a taller man can have sex with a shorter female partner while both standing. i felt embarrassed and outraged that this magazine was out on the tables in the waiting room for any age group to read. i am age 48 college educated and the mother of 2 teenagers. i would not want my 13 year-old daughter to consider this light reading or helpful advice nor do i think it appropriate for a magazine such as redbook. parents please seriously consider whether you want this magazine on the end tables in your homes. it has changed ",negative

" i never bought gq back in my 20s because for one thing i never thought of myself as a clothes-horse. also i actually took the g in gq to mean that it was actually for gentlemen ie sipping champagne on a yacht pass me the the caviar type gentlemen. well after now having reached a certain age i find myself going back and forth between esquire and gq and find that in many cases neither are exactly right for me. however i think i've bought my last episode of gq. the 2006 interview with will ferrel was interesting for the first three paragraphs and then it became an excercise in self referentialism disguised as an attempt at wit. also the politics of the magazine are unabashedly anti-bush administration which would be ok except for the fact that i'm not reading gq for political content. there are plenty of magazines out there make this their specialty and when i find it in gq its just tiresome. frequently swipes at bush and his policies just come out of nowhere in an article as if the editor decided that a jab at bush and his policies might help the piece regardless of its content. not to mention - does anyone actually wear the clothing they put on display? $800 tennis shoes? i fear that i will be an esquire reader - i can't bear to become a men's best life subscriber just yet ",negative
" i first subscribed to gq when it was still a quarterly...an issue only every 3 months. back then it was primarily a men's fashion magazine. it was sophisticated useful and classy filled with clothing men could actually wear and practical grooming tips trends and style. i suppose in many ways it resembled a ralph lauren print ad. now fashion is relegated to a few pages in the back of the magazine with men wearing things they seem to have found at a local flea market. nothing seems to fit properly patterns - plaids - stripes...anything goes. it resembles homeless couture. odds and ends that nobody should actually wear. sure the world has changed. but fashion good taste and quality are timeless despite tweaking and contemporary preferences. the editors may feel that grunge hopeless edginess for it's own sake and adolescent sloppiness sell issues. but they might be surprised that there's a huge pent up demand for sophistication and real style both formal and relaxed. i hope someone else picks up the torch.

" the legend goes that there was a time a few decades ago when the gramophone was the unquestioned authority for reviews of recordings of classical music. whether or not that legend is true (i'm too young to know) gramophone's time has definitely passed. today there is a multitude of sources of free information on classical music on the internet from newsgroups to websites. some of it is less well-informed than gramophone's criticism but some of it is more well-informed. what is undeniable is that for the price of a few mouse-clicks it is possible to find a far greater range of reviews of recordings on the internet than gramophone (with its british-based critics) can offer. what is more gramophone is tied to a business-model for the classical music industry that is fast becoming obsolete. historically the most important classical recordings were issued by a few so-called major companies such as emi deutsche grammophon and cbs (later sony). these majors would buy lavish advertising spreads in gramophone and so finance the magazine. in return gramophone would devote lengthy reviews to the majors' new releases and would produce pages of fluffy interviews with musicians under contract to the majors. today the situation is different. the most interesting new release is more likely to appear as a mp3 on an obscure russian website than on a new cd from sony. small companies dedicated solely to classical music recordings produce great results on shoestring budgets while the major corporations have virtually abandoned new classical recordings. this development causes problems for gramophone's business model. the new players in the classical music industry don't have the publicity budgets to fund a glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising. with gramophone's implicit bargain: advertise with us or we won't review your recordings the magazine seems to be becoming more and more irrelevant. if you want to subscribe to a classical music periodical i recommend international record review or fanfare. both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone. but most of all i suggest checking out the huge range of classical music information available for free on the web and usenet ",negative

" i used to love outburn magazine. i first discovered it when i came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain. the first thing i saw on the cover was vnv nation. i bought that issue and soon after that i ordered a subscription. what i loved about outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that aren't covered in the mainstream music magazines namely those in the goth ebm synthpop and industrial scene. unfortunately within the next year and a half the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands two genres i don't give a rat's behind about. i don't know wtf happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music i would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to. just like alternative press outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends ",negative

" i was a charter subscriber to this magazine when it started up publication. it was a breath of fresh air in a stagnant field of almost universally wretched photography magazines. over the years things changed. columnists died or moved on. editorial directions were switched. articles that once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers. when digital photography became dominant in the marketplace outdoor photographer was in the vanguard pushing every gadget and photoshop manipulation plug-in that popped up. the magazine became a wasteland of promises of better pictures if you just buy _____ (fill in the blank with whatever the current trend might be). what i thought was ironic at the time was that the best photographs they printed were being done by photographers using the least sophisticated equipment. photographers using film (!?) a lot of large format guys occasionally some black and white and stuff made with cameras just about any serious hobbist already owned. but these portfolios began to dwindle from occasional to rare to almost non-existent. at some point my interest in this garbage lapsed before my subscription. the magazine made a once monthly trip from the mailbox to the trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it. outdoor photographer impresses people who measure quality photography by whether or not the equipment used in production cost the equivalent of the gross national product of small third world countries. it offers little in the way of nutrition to a hungry mind. it's empty calories just making you want more and more while starving your potential. it truly is wretched.

" i was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas. it isn't really and there isn't really that much to this magazine. it is just another tired old aoltimewarner publication just like time people or teen people. i looked at the august and september issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on elton john's out of africa fundraiser and the article on julian mcmahon. the rest of it was ads and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in vogue magazine but the same old ads you'll see anywhere else and they are annoying. there were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of kelly ripa (post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it plastic person syndrome) mark consuelos waay too much on jennifer garner and her baby and other weird things such as the trend of designer cupcakes. i wish i was kidding on the latter but i am not nor do i have $25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is jessica alba's favorite. there was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here. despite the size of this magazine there is very little to sink ones teeth into just way too many photos of the same old same old and tips for mimicking them. i am not interested in becoming a teri hatcher clone nor am i interested in seeing vanessa carlton's pad. this magazine is for you if you like excessive ads no diversity a subscription that is actually not a year (it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine) and your life's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in new york because some celebrity did. this magazine is mediocre at best and the worst part is it has the exact same fashion advice as vogue. i went with vogue because there is substance in their magazine and the ads are classy and very chic. leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at aol time warner.

" after falling in love with gourmet's yellow cookbook i subscribed to gourmet hoping for the same great classic recipes and commonsense commentary. wow what a disappointment. i have just received my second issue and as another reviewer said it is about 90% ads for high-end luxury goods like jewelry and cars. the 6-page special advertisement section stops being so special when there are 20 of them in one issue! what happened ruth reichl? the few recipes that one can find are unattractive and/or too difficult for even weekend cooking. for those cooks looking for a great cooking magazine i highly recommend bon appetit over gourmet: the majority of the magazine is recipes and cooking tips with only interspersed ads. i will be calling to see if i can get my subscription switched tomorrow.

" i began subscribing to gourmet in 1961 and continued to subscribe for about forty years. i also gifted family members with subscriprions. i discontinued my subscription because the magazine has deteriorated so much in the last several years: there are so many ads and tear-outs in the magazine that one can hardly find the recipes at least half of the magazine and sometimes more; also i object to the political and some downright offensive articles. i am catholic and i was very offended by an outrageous article charging that during the nazi era naked jews were made to crawl through the streets on their knees by persons which the article linked in some way to the catholic church. i think that the information was apochryphal; and what does this have to do with food?

" first issue arrived today. after tearing up 8 or 9 insert ads which made it difficult to read the magazine i sat back to enjoy. first article was a lecture by robert f. kennedy jr. on the danger of mercury in fresh water domestic fish. perfectly safe to fish we are informed (well duh). just don't eat what you catch. expectant mothers should be extra careful as babies with high level of mercury have lower iqs. the net is full of peer-reviewed studies from major universities on the subject of mercury poisoning. why buy a food magazine to read what an activist lawyer has to say about the subject? next article was in: politics and the plate. the controversy here concerns local and season foods. gourmet asks: are those who promote them sincere? or is it just a come on for gullible diners? so who does gourmet think is gullible? the reader? implication seems to be the reader is too stupid to figure out that yes vendors might promote locally grown products that aren't all that terrific. nothing of substance in this article at all. going back to the front an editor of gourmet recalls how her late father didn't appreciate health food stores (aren't fathers stupid?). three downer articles in a row. i gave up. this isn't the magazine i remember from 20 years ago. even the format is annoying. it is difficult to know where ads end and articles begin (recall the most junked up website you've seen that is the gourmet model) if you do enjoy the politics and the environmental stuff (on either side) you can do better on the net for free. if you want entertaining informative articles on food gourmet is not the place to look. subscribed to saveur at the same time as gourmet. it is a pleasure to read. no annoying ads no political screeds. great photographs. interesting and exotic recipes. as good or better than gourmet was decades ago.

" today i purchased my first and probably last issue of gourmet. while there were plenty of recipes (some of which i won't use but they were still cool to look at) there were tons of ads. it makes you wonder either a) how much the people who make this magazine get paid or b) for all the ads why this isn't free. i can see the need for a few ads so that we the consumers don't have to pay a fortune for a good magazine. but i took out 33 pages of ads and figured there were about 140 full page ads. that's over half of the magazine which is 260 pages. that's really sad. recipe wise some of them look interesting and very gourmet but there are things you need to have that i can't get in the middle of the u.s. and about three of the six articles were interesting to read - when you could find them slipped inbetween their plethora of ads. fine cooking is still the best one out there ",negative

" i like to read cook's illustrated at the library. their magazine is much too expensive for the small amount of recipes included within. i like the tips sent in by readers and some of the product reviews. i have found that most of their recipes are very involved--nitpicky to be kind. the lemon meringue pie recipe--which i tried from their america's test kitchen cookbook--calls for cooking cornstarch in water cooling it and then beating the solution into the meringue. supposedly this keeps the meringue from destabilizing. all that happened in my kitchen was i found little lumps of cornstarch glue at the bottom of my mixing bowl while scraping out the meringue. i have made meringue before without cornstarch and can't help thinking this is an extra step that isn't neccessary. their best brownies are good but i can make equally good brownies without all the extra steps involved in melting chocolate and cooling it etc. if you're looking for easy fool proof recipes that don't take a gazillion steps and aren't fussy about exactly what ingredients you use this isn't the magazine for you ",negative

" i subscribed to cooks magazine some years ago back when it began publishing again. i had problems with issues that failed to arrive and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern. since that time i occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest. even by dint of casual glance i've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the perfect recipe for something or other. i now skip right to the perfected recipe and decide whether its worth committing to memory. some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best. there are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me: 1. product reviews: they range from just plain wrong to idiotic. the kitchenaid pro 600 was hailed by cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores. yet the amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart allowing the metal gears to separate. christopher kimball (the editor) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight. no i'm not joking. in that evaluation le creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy. all-clad even though it conducts heat very evenly suffered for not having as much heft and therefore was judged pricey on a pound weight basis. one issue of cooks boasted on its cover unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others. apparently hershey's was designated best. not too many months later callebaut was recommended above all others and hershey's was judged barely acceptable. feeling manipulated yet? 2. finally there are those dreadful editorials by mr. kimball. rambling painfully written and punctuated with a picture of mr. kimball wearing a bow tie and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it. mr. kimball is a humble man with much to be humble about. he writes as if he were chanelling helen gurley brown but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play. time to re-vamp this magazine folks ",negative
" cook's illustrated is the first cooking magazine that i'd found myself truly motivated to read cover-to-cover even though they do insert advertisements for their own products which i suppose to them makes this an ad-free magazine but i'm not surprised they've bent the rules with that claim. the one time i found it necessary to contact cook's illustrated about a customer service issue i was simply floored by the treatment that i received... i'll simply leave it at that. i personally don't intend on re-subscribing (fine cooking here i come!). you however may find that this is the cooking magazine for you. and as far as what they do goes cook's illustrated is good at what they do - i'll give them that. if you have not found this review to be helpful i'm sorry if i haven't made the value in my warning apparent. just know that there are those of us out there who have had bad experiences and are simply trying to prevent others from experiencing the same.

" i should preface this reveiw with the fact that i am an accomplished home cook. i have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks. i do not buy commercially prepared products like breads crackers mayonnaise or salad dressings. i make these items myself. i suspect that i am not the target audience for this publication. the may/june 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total. given that there are only 6 issues a year i was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages. the may/june 2006 issue contains the following information: simplifying moroccan chicken bringing home fish and chips grilled tomato salsa grilled london broil main-dish vegetable stir-fries how to cook pasta foolproof veal scaloppini a new twist on chicken salads garlic and olive oil mashed potatoes utimate turtle brownies best strawberry cream cake the scoop on vanilla ice cream a review of tongs if you are an experienced cook their isn't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you. this issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking. however i enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful. this magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook. bottom line i will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little more meat in their content. i think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive. i would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their best of cookbook instead. it costs about the same amount contains many more recipes has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer. additionally check out an issue of fine cooking which is another test kitchen type of publication just with more depth.

" back in the 1970's my grandmother subscribed to prevention. at that time it was a wonderful magazine filled with informative articles aimed at the prevention of illness and the promotion of wellness (as the founder of prevention j.i. rodale had preached). articles about the role of vitamins and nutrition were light years ahead of their time. (j.i. can be given a lot of credit for bringing vitamins and supplements to the mainstream). over the years and especially after the tragic death of robert rodale (j.i.'s son) and the takeover by his wife and daughter it has unfortunately transformed into a fluffy tabloid-like women's magazine with scantily clad women on the covers and one- or two-page articles instructing women to get killer abs and burn the fat. i think j.i. rodale is probably spinning in his grave to see what his descendents have done to butcher this magazine which bears no resemblence whatsoever to what it used to be. i flipped through a copy in disgust recently to note as another reviewer has stated plenty of ads for drugs which really seems to go against the idea of preventing illness in the first place (whereas the old prevention sang the praises of vitamins and health foods). i don't know why the rodale family doesn't just scrap the title and call it something else but alas they are a major corporation now and i have little hope that this magazine will improve any time soon ",negative

" i picked up an issue of this magazine last week because i wanted to take the picture of the cover girl into my hair dresser. after i got it home i opened it up to check it out and discovered it is the most brainless magazine i have ever seen. the articles read like something from teen beat yet it's filled with adult material. there were about 10 articles on how to please your man and what guys like and even a sex workout. these articles didn't contain any real advice--just unintelligent babble. for instance did any of you know that guys don't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex? hmmm crazy. anyway i don't see how anyone over the age of 16 could find any of this stimulating and yet there are too many articles about one-night stands for anyone under 18 to read. but if you're still into taking quizzes and looking at half-naked hunks who have barely hit puberty then this magazine is perfect. i would have given this magazine 0 stars but unfortunately it's not an option ",negative

" once thought of as a women's health magazine cosmo has taken a twisted turn into pointless redundancy. at one point cosmo seemed to be a must-have along with water and oxygen. more and more lately it seems that the magazine is posing the question how can we survive on only water and oxygen and still be sexy while we do? ocassionally a featured article faces the issues of things ranging from eating disorders to politics but few and far between. they don't seem to realize that on the other side of the page for the eating disorder article is a woman who wears a size 0 and is still unsatisfied with herself thinking that she must conform to some heroin-chic fad. fun fearless female - articles about real women who make a real difference - is great. it shines the spotlight on someone who not only is beautiful and successful but has enough education and talent to succeed in the world without needing a man. if the magazine featured more of these things maybe it would be worth my subscription fee. but tell me when the last time is that you saw a cover not featuring the phrases mind-blowing sex how to satisfy (insert breathing life form here) or barely-there which seems to refer to not just underwear anymore but everything. this isn't a magazine about women's health anymore. it's all about how to keep your man happy while still conforming to social standards in fashion weight and financial standings. i'm sorry but the girl on a budget can't afford a $430 skirt or uncomfortable shoes with the uncomfortable price of $300+. cater more to the real woman; not the one who only cares about her relationship status pant size and bank account ",negative
" i had hopes that this magazine would be a nice alternative to the others out there. from the moment i opened it it felt so smug. i gave it a chance and read it cover to cover (the april issue). but what finally did me in (after having read that i could buy an $800 blouse to make me feel pretty in that after pregnancy stage that i could match my children's shoes to my jimmy choo's and finally that i could buy my child the latest $300 tricycle) was the article entitled normal about a child who was misdiagnosed with autism. the article discussed how distraught the mother was after her child was diagnosed with autism to the point that she tried to committ suicide. the article ended with the fact that the child turned out to be a genius. what was the point of this article? to say thank god it wasn't true? what about those parents out there who have an autistic child how does this article make them feel? the article was painful and insensitive. there are better ways to spend you $10 than on cookie ",negative

" i was one of entertainment weekly's charter subscribers way back in 1990. it started out great -- a different intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage. but financially things were shaky so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience. i couldn't blame the editors. it helped them reach the needed tipping point and they gained their needed mass audience. ew remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus and i kept resubscribing. until 2006. these last few months ew has fallen off a cliff. it has become entirely superficial and shallow with hardly any substance at all. the publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format. i can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience. so i've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be ",negative
" this magazine is just page after page of hollywood p.r. agencies releases. unbelievable. why didn't i think of it? i know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources but other than a few pages of very subjective movie/music/book reviews this magazine just re-writes and prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again and again and again. this magazine must not have a staff of writers but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes. the funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by say tom cruise's management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever sassy wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks. uh okay - wait didn't you get the press release? if you tivo extra and have the theme to entertainment tonight as your ringtone this magazine is right up your alley. otherwise don't waste a penny on this nonsense.

" i've been a subscriber to this for over 10 years and i've loved getting this but it has undergone changes recently and not for the better. specifically i hate what they've done to the graphical design inside. whereas they used to employ several different styles when it came to things like fonts and artwork for whatever subject was written about now they've adopted a uniform style where nearly everything looks the same. it looked better before. the writing isn't as witty or sharp (have longtime staff departed?) and there are filler pieces in the form of moronic sidebars and boxes - useless attempts at humor that simply don't work. the strength of the magazine continues to come from the critics especially the movie and dvd section. sadly typically when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i'm going to have to consider letting my sub expire 'cos i don't let my mailbox fill with crap like this ",negative
" i have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and i have become very skeptical of much of its advice. this advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g. the us dairy industry (there is always at least one of those annoying got milk ads) and not surprisingly every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products (e.g. milk and cheese). however having read many books on nutrition it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the the china study by colin campbell an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the us dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public's perception of the healthfulness of its products. it is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers' paychecks. the magazine also appears to be very similar to prevention magazine which i also have subscribed to and i would make the same criticism of. my advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent berkeley wellness letter that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the us dairy industry ",negative

" i have been a reader of businessweek for over 10 years. i have noticed that it has had a significant change in focus over the last year. while there are more articles on personal business the hard-core articles have gone the way of newsweek and u.s. news and world reports. the nature of the articles are lightweight and do not reflect issues important to decision makers today. like many others i have noticed a political slant or agenda over the last year. specifically their commentaries and economic analysis trend to the left. bob kuttner is co-editor of the american prospect and contributor to the boston globe. every one of his articles begins with the premise that the president's policies are bad and then is followed by a tortuous rational for that thesis to include discussion of the days of gold backed currency. andrea d'andrea tyson is better but as a former clinton advisor is not objective in her analysis. alternative economic opinions are far and few between and what opinions they do tout does not agree with the numbers stated in their own figures of the week. while bw has the potential for great reporting based on their resources they have let their editorial priorities get in the way of serious business reporting. for serious business readers and students i recommend going to alternative sources. and yes i will let my subscription lapse this year.

" i subscribe to the online edition you can receive through email in pdf form. i was looking forward to reading reviews of the latest audiobooks and hearing what the reviewers thought about them. frankly i was disappointed. the reviews are little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis (the same info which might be gleaned from looking up the title on amazon.com or reading the back of the book). reviewers add about 1 sentence or so to the title and call it a review... please. they are also fairly out of date. most of the audio titles reviewed are older titles which have been out for a while. some titles aren't available anywhere that i can figure. whats the point in reviewing an audio title you can't find? my interest is primariy sci-fi horror and romantic-horror. most of the titles audiofile reviews are fiction. the articles aren't particularly interesting. frankly i could care less what the narrator thinks or feels as long as they have a good voice. there is also a sort of...literay snob tone to audiofile. i get the feeling they like certain authors and certain titles and tend to overly focus on them. i'd really like to see audiofile have a 'coming soon' review column. it would be very useful to know what titles will be coming out in the future. i'd also like to see more romance dark fantasy and horror reviews or at least make the section focusing on different genres a little more clear. i also think the sections focussing on children's titles and self-help are a little large. 2 stars. if you must subscribe get the online version. that way you can cancel anytime and don't have to worry about subscription problems ",negative

" i've been watching this magazine slide downhill for some time but they've finally hit bottom. the bulk of the april 25 2006 magazine was devoted to cars. yes todays automobiles are becoming highly computerized but the magazine is supposed to highlight the software and hardware that we use on our desktops. pc mag has been drifting far afield doing articles on apple computers gaming systems and extensive reviews on cameras. instead of pcs the subject seems to be anything that has a computer chip in it or is in some way remotely related to computers. the obvious inference is that there's nothing interesting going on in the pc world so they have to keep stretching just to fill the pages. i find that hard to believe; i think it's more likely that the staff has lost their focus or they've hired people who are not interested in or qualified to write about pcs. the lack of pertinent content makes the dwindling size of the magazine even more apparent. what used to rival a small phone book is now about the size of time magazine. they now have a new look and it's awful. their readership used to consist of well educated technically sophisticated professionals. these people don't need a dozen arrows pointing into every photograph with cutesy handwritten notes belaboring the obvious. that's more appropriate for the folks who had a hard time getting through high school and have short attention spans. compare this issue to the issues from a couple years ago and it's obvious that they've dumbed down the entire magazine. i've subscribed to pc magazine for years and considered it a must read to keep up with the rapidly evolving hardware and software of the pc world. but no more -- it's time to find one that has something useful to write on the subject of personal computers.

" i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. frankly the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters. a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers--to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view. unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story--any future coverage is designed to prove time's initial position correct. the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories--we told you so we told you so. even worse the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story. can't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn? out of sight out of mind is the mantra... in fact i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media; newspapers are failing television news can't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance. we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis. neutrality is dead. frankly i don't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant. time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states--no more. iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page. african states are making vast strides towards democracy we get an article about nigerian computer fraud. russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq. japan one of the world's most influential cultures in the week i originally wrote this review (see 12-month subscription) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling. somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein's puerile take on pornography and social deviants. but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks: how in the hell did our world become boring? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage--educate the reader about the world in which we live; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week. time has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news ",negative

" time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage and recent years have only accelerated this trend. in the 60s and 70s it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend (originally it was considered quite conservative) but as the years go by it's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance. as for its being part of the liberal media this is inaccurate. recent coverage of the (2004) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non-person. the first debate between john kerry and george w. bush was not even covered except for one very brief article listing a few fact check points. instead the cover story wa about new products and movies a kind of sharper image catalog lite. time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan. it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u.s. election but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine's ignoring a signficant world event that george w. bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office. in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment. the bias seems to be in favor of mr. bush but it's still mostly bland and superficial. your money is better spent on the british magazine the economist which is far more substantive. while its editorial viewpoint is conservative it's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u.s. politics. the economist also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i've found to a (dare i say it) fair-and-balanced approach to the news. time can still be entertaining to read but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously. they tend to bend with the political wind ",negative

" this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports. their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be #1 in ranking. often the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that isn't relevant or doesn't make sense or the review isn't consistent with the posted viehicle stats. the magazine also seems to be biased. some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful. after further reading of many issues you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers for example you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically trash and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews. ultimately its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period. its the pat robertson of auto magazines. if it were possible i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star.

" i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. frankly the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters. a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers--to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view. unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story--any future coverage is designed to prove time's initial position correct. the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories--we told you so we told you so. even worse the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story. can't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn? out of sight out of mind is the mantra... in fact i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media; newspapers are failing television news can't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance. we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis. neutrality is dead. frankly i don't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant. time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states--no more. iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page. african states are making vast strides towards democracy we get an article about nigerian computer fraud. russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq. japan one of the world's most influential cultures in the week i originally wrote this review (see 12-month subscription) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling. somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein's puerile take on pornography and social deviants. but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks: how in the hell did our world become boring? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage--educate the reader about the world in which we live; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week. time has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news ",negative

" time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage and recent years have only accelerated this trend. in the 60s and 70s it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend (originally it was considered quite conservative) but as the years go by it's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance. as for its being part of the liberal media this is inaccurate. recent coverage of the (2004) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non-person. the first debate between john kerry and george w. bush was not even covered except for one very brief article listing a few fact check points. instead the cover story wa about new products and movies a kind of sharper image catalog lite. time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan. it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u.s. election but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine's ignoring a signficant world event that george w. bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office. in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment. the bias seems to be in favor of mr. bush but it's still mostly bland and superficial. your money is better spent on the british magazine the economist which is far more substantive. while its editorial viewpoint is conservative it's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u.s. politics. the economist also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i've found to a (dare i say it) fair-and-balanced approach to the news. time can still be entertaining to read but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously. they tend to bend with the political wind ",negative
" it is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head. it skims the surface and is 'pop'. anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world. again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world (newsweek is exactly the same) especially in the united states. time magazine is from the same people that gave us cnn and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the u.s. and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice. the other irritating thing about time is it's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious. subscribe to the economist there are less pictures !

" don't purchase subscriptions from amazon or magazine express. the following are my experiences with a subscription to hiragana times from amazon. what this page doesn't tell you is that the japanese magazines subscribed to on amazon are filled by a company called magazine express and are shipped seamail from japan which mean you'll recieve every issue 8 to 10 after it's released. i placed my order in january and to date have not recieved a single issue. after several phone calls the magazine express people (who fill the amazon subscriptions) said they had to restart my subscription for the may issues which will take 8-10 weeks due to shipping issues. so after ordering in january i will not receive a single issue of this uncancelable magazine until possibly in late july. very poor service. this is unacceptable for a magazine that most us japanese bookstores (fujisan is one) can get within a week or that you can order directly from the publisher for only a few dollars more. if i had known the shipping policy i would not have ordered and the magazine supplier magazine express will not cancel the subscrition. i advise avoiding all amazon magazine subsriptions due to their poorly stated policies. **update i wrote this review in june. it is now july 8th and i've just been informed i must wait until august 15th to see if an issue arrives. i ordered the magazine on january 9th and i have had no resolution from either magazine express or amazon who provides no way to contact anyone within amazon about magazine orders. i reiterate buying magazines from amazon if a poor idea ",negative

" well imagine my surprise when i picked up the february 2004 issue and found that things had drastically changed. mainly in the editor's letter. it used to be 1 page now it's just a small little column now that is exactly like other ziff davis game mags now the redesign isnt as bad as other zd game mags but the removal of the 1 page editor's letter really steams me up. at least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey's scorched earth column. it's still 1 page. it's on the last page usually. and yes the redesign is really bad in terms of readability. most of the time they have a red or blue or yellow background and it's really hard to read the text at times. now at least their disc will auto-load unlike pc gamer. and what really pisses me off is when a magazine has a hot 100 section or a best pc's or videocards or peripherals section and they hardly ever change the captions or descriptions come with it. i'm sorry if i got off track a lot but i felt the need to. i hope this review helped you. edit: 5/8/2004 pc gamer recently changed editor's and the editor-in-chief was re-assigned to become the editor-in-chief of the official xbox magazine. the new eic of pcg is the former executive editor and i hate him so this is why i say cgw is now the best pc games magazine ",negative

(not to mention an overload of advertising- which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway so that's not a complaint). sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased (telling the facts of stds and such) but 90% of the articles on sex were opinion and not fact. girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like seventeen who say that sex is good if you're ready (what 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an std or a baby?? please.) and that condoms are 100% effective. they are not but that's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this. they need to take advice from their parents and doctors not magazine articles. i was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences.

" please read naomi jakobs' review for relevant magazine below. it captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the christian 'post-modern' kick. if you have to go out of your way to claim you're a celebrity then you simply aren't a celebrity (take fitness celebrity john basedow for example). in the same way if you have go out of your way to claim that the post-modern evangelical movement is relevant then you're claim for relevancy is simply not credible. the christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years. however pop-culturalizing evangelical christianity isn't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when sandi patty or carmen ruled the christian top 40. does the fact that some christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable ",negative
" admittedly i am slightly older than the relevant demographic. but i'm not 40 yet! so there are a number of things here that do have some appeal to me. and i applaud the magazine for attempting to address culturally important issues. still the magazine suffers from it's unrelenting fawning over the whole post-modern vibe and it's own sense of self-importance as a beacon for charismatic hipness. (hey look out world! we jesus freaks have ipods too!) usually the more something or someone sweats to proclaim their own relevance the more danger there is that they can become irrelevant. so like it's spiritual cousin charisma this magazine suffers from a somewhat shallow perspective on life and culture. it trumpets its ability to ask the tough questions even as it follows a relatively safe politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line. i mean their idea of being cutting edge was to put bono on the cover. if you want to be cutting edge put the libertine adam clayton on the cover and ask him about bono's faith. now i would read that article! (i am a major u2 and bono fan. i'm not knocking him; just the lack of imagination at relevant.) there's also way too much emulation of the world's perspective on generational heritage. hey we're young and we're smart and we don't need to do anything the way our geezer parents did it. i guess having a little gray hair or wrinkles doesn't cut it in today's paris hilton culture but i'd like to think that it might be a little different in a culture shaped by biblical values. actually relevant seems to be a little afraid to say what biblical values are (beyond the obvious politically expedient ones); it all seems amorphous here. i've never been a fan of the whole what's hot/what's not ethos. and i'd like to give a little more respect to today's christian young people to think they could handle something that didn't fall into that same faddish trap. i am hopeful that they may get it right yet with relevant. at times they seem tantilizingly close. but it takes more than a slick hairdo male earrings chin stubble idolization of youth culture icon quotations and psycobabble cool dude theological lingo to make one relevant ",negative

" i was one of entertainment weekly's charter subscribers way back in 1990. it started out great -- a different intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage. but financially things were shaky so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience. i couldn't blame the editors. it helped them reach the needed tipping point and they gained their needed mass audience. ew remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus and i kept resubscribing. until 2006. these last few months ew has fallen off a cliff. it has become entirely superficial and shallow with hardly any substance at all. the publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format. i can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience. so i've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be ",negative
" this magazine is just page after page of hollywood p.r. agencies releases. unbelievable. why didn't i think of it? i know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources but other than a few pages of very subjective movie/music/book reviews this magazine just re-writes and prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again and again and again. this magazine must not have a staff of writers but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes. the funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by say tom cruise's management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever sassy wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks. uh okay - wait didn't you get the press release? if you tivo extra and have the theme to entertainment tonight as your ringtone this magazine is right up your alley. otherwise don't waste a penny on this nonsense.

" i've been a subscriber to this for over 10 years and i've loved getting this but it has undergone changes recently and not for the better. specifically i hate what they've done to the graphical design inside. whereas they used to employ several different styles when it came to things like fonts and artwork for whatever subject was written about now they've adopted a uniform style where nearly everything looks the same. it looked better before. the writing isn't as witty or sharp (have longtime staff departed?) and there are filler pieces in the form of moronic sidebars and boxes - useless attempts at humor that simply don't work. the strength of the magazine continues to come from the critics especially the movie and dvd section. sadly typically when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i'm going to have to consider letting my sub expire 'cos i don't let my mailbox fill with crap like this ",negative
" this magazine shows the negative side of black men. i find the magazine an embarrasement to the african-american community. it seems out of all the races of men in the world black men seem to want to display their lack of self control their love of fancy cars overpriced clothes which in no way helps create wealth in our communities. and i am also offended that this magazine rarely shows black women on the front cover. until black men understand that this kind of pathetic display of supposed masculinity is stopped they will always be stopped by the police be passed over for employment and looked down upon. i wish someone would create a magazine for black men which shows the positive side of being a black man such as being leaders in their community showing respect and love for their women and showing that everything is not hip hip!

" ...because that's all this magazine is: an advertising vehicle aimed at kids who aren't old enough to discriminate between ads and actual content yet. don't be fooled by the venerable national geographic name: this publications pays only the briefest lip service to educational content. when my son received it as a gift i was shocked to see that the ads were virtually indistiguishable from the articles. and in fact the ads were often much more visually interesting. the photos were excellent i must admit. but the layout was jazzed up to the point of absurdity as if designed to play to kids with minuscule attention spans. the science facts were sound but again the articles were cut absurdly short more like squibs and factoids than actual articles as if the editors believe that kids couldn't possibly focus on one topic long enough to actually read more than 250 words about it...or maybe because they didn't want to distract the kids from all that tantalizingly lucrative advertising stuffed onto every page. as an editor and a parent i am appalled by this magazine and would not recommend it to anyone. national geographic should be ashamed of itself for pushing this kind of junk on young readers. avoid this publication like the plague.

" this magazine is another part of the murdoch empire. its worst sin is that its boring and not very conservative. it was founded by william kristol john podhoretz and fred barnes to be a institutional conservative publication under tight control and with deep enough pockets to dwarf its smaller rivals. when conservativism was a living movement it was best characterized as a collection of independent voices who while they respected each other didn't always agree with each other. now following the murdoch formula its about getting as many people whatever their ideology on the payroll. the price of being on the payroll is of course not rocking the boat. reading conservative publications these days is like reading the transcripts of someone engaging in a monologue in an echo chamber. its strange that there is so much conservative media today but that most policy decisions don't get debated or even discussed among conservatives. they seem more interested in covering liberals than discussing ideas or making proposals. and for god's sake no more articles by those who are agnostics in their private life talking about how america needs more god this or god that. if your going to be religious at least find someone who is sincere. and no more articles on the greatness of family by childless unmarried women who are totally devoted to careers to the exclusion of anything else.

" as you can tell by the title i'm not enamored of this magazine. i've been playing video games since the early 80s and have read many many gaming magazines. my reasons for this negative review of gamepro follow in no particular order: 1.) their numerical rating system stinks. 1-5 points is just not accurate enough. most mags/web sites have a 1-10 system with decimals. not gamepro. 2.) the written part of the reviews are way too short and often are written borderline incoherantly. it's as if they hired the proverbial 1000 monkeys to type them out. 3.) often times they cram two or three reviews on one page. screen shots provided with reviews are often the size of a postage stamp. 4.) the number of ads in relation to content is distinctly high. once when i was bored i counted all the ads in one issue. out of around 110 pages there were 60+ pages of ads. 5.) their article layouts are confusing and occasionally they print on colored backgrounds that closely match the text color. forget about reading it if you're colorblind. 6.) their gaming tips are either so obvious that a brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out or plain don't work. i suspect that the ones that do are ripped off from various web sites. 7.) gamepro costs the same as better gaming mags such as egm and game informer. so in closing... if you want a good gaming magazine just about any magazine other than gamepro would be an improvement. many great gaming magazines have come and gone why a turd like gamepro continues is a mystery to me ",negative

" a great magazine. i had a subscription for 2 years that ended about 6-8 months ago. i paid $104 for the 2 year subscription back then but suddenly the price in the us has skyrocketed astronomically. i can go to any music store or a borders/barnes and noble and buy each individual magazine for anywhere from $8/issue to $9/issue typically and i have never seen it more than $9/issue. however suddenly the subscription they have is like $13 an issue which is outrageous. it's not amazon's doing either i was a subscriber for 2 years and this same thing happened to me. they asked me to come back at a lower rate (something like $99/year) which is still $8.25 an issue. sure that's might be a bit cheaper (about 25 cents an issue on the average price above) than buying each one in the store but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually especially at tthat price. the upside is that uncut is far and away the best music/movie magazine in the world. i'd say about 60-70% of the issues i would have bought in the store when i was a subscriber. but until they begin printing the magazine in the states it's just not worth a subscription. the writing of the magazine is superb. brilliant and varied writing throughout. each magazine is about as big as a small book too and of them i'd read a good 80% of the magazine too (even finding myself reading some articles about artists i could care less about because the articles were so well written) but the price is way too high to subscribe. it's a shame too. rolling stone is nowhere close to being as good as uncut and although mojo and q are strong they can't hold the candle to it either. the only blemish on the magazine itself (for all you who might want to buy a single issue) is that the covers tend to repeat every 3-4 months and i mean how much beatles can i read (and i'm in the upper 5% of beatle freaks out there). still the magazine is well worth it the subscription price is too incredibly high though to recommend in any circumstances. i would think this would be a great market to move into in the us if i was in that position. i don't think rolling stone could compete anymore. if it would make things cheaper i would do away with the free cd bonus too. aside from a few listens and the novelty of it all (the free cd was a good incentive to make me interested a few years back) the cd's get old quick and after a while i would toss them out after a quick preview. summary: wait until/if the price drops but don't subscribe. it's too expensive and much cheaper to buy each magazine individually. the magazine itself though is 5 stars and almost always great ",negative

" i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. frankly the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters. a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers--to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view. unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story--any future coverage is designed to prove time's initial position correct. the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories--we told you so we told you so. even worse the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story. can't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn? out of sight out of mind is the mantra... in fact i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media; newspapers are failing television news can't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance. we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis. neutrality is dead. frankly i don't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant. time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states--no more. iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page. african states are making vast strides towards democracy we get an article about nigerian computer fraud. russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq. japan one of the world's most influential cultures in the week i originally wrote this review (see 12-month subscription) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling. somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein's puerile take on pornography and social deviants. but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks: how in the hell did our world become boring? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage--educate the reader about the world in which we live; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week. time has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news ",negative

" time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage and recent years have only accelerated this trend. in the 60s and 70s it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend (originally it was considered quite conservative) but as the years go by it's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance. as for its being part of the liberal media this is inaccurate. recent coverage of the (2004) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non-person. the first debate between john kerry and george w. bush was not even covered except for one very brief article listing a few fact check points. instead the cover story wa about new products and movies a kind of sharper image catalog lite. time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan. it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u.s. election but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine's ignoring a signficant world event that george w. bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office. in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment. the bias seems to be in favor of mr. bush but it's still mostly bland and superficial. your money is better spent on the british magazine the economist which is far more substantive. while its editorial viewpoint is conservative it's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u.s. politics. the economist also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i've found to a (dare i say it) fair-and-balanced approach to the news. time can still be entertaining to read but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously. they tend to bend with the political wind ",negative
" it is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head. it skims the surface and is 'pop'. anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world. again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world (newsweek is exactly the same) especially in the united states. time magazine is from the same people that gave us cnn and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the u.s. and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice. the other irritating thing about time is it's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious. subscribe to the economist there are less pictures !

" first off i usually just stick to rating & critiquing movies. but every time i see an ad on this website for this time/warner (or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week) rag-mag i start to see red. entertainment weekly which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash. back in the summer of 89 ew was released and after i read a few issues i decided to subscribe. i was instantly hooked (the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the saturday before it would hit regular newstands) & i liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies music t.v. and video (that was later added in the mid-90's). the problem with the magazine started in the late 90's. i started to notice that ew would cover a big movie or event that hadn't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales. i also hate the damn lists that ew comes up with. the latest entitled the top 100 most memorable movie lines was a joke. these lists have always annoyed me because i feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking. the other & most important thing i noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review. case in point a few weeks ago i picked up the latest issue in which the movie catwoman had been reviewed (i wasn't to sure if it was gleiberman or shwarzbaum that critiqued it). i first logged onto rotten tomatoes.com to see what percentile catwoman recieved from the nation's critics. out of roughly 115 reviews catwoman only got 10% of the good reviews while the rest trashed it (a film needs at least to get a grade of 60 - 65% in order to place it as a fresh or good movie). that makes catwoman the worst reviewed film so far for 2004. yet ew gave the film a b. what erkes me even more is that catwoman is released by warner bros. the same company that owns the rights to the harry potter films the lord of the rings trilogy & yes the wb owns entertainment weekly. is warner bros. trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular & lucrative magazine's? i'm not the only who has seen this developement. people have written in saying that there is favoritism among warner products that are reviewed in the magazine. ew of course hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews possibly in fear of being fired (they will deny that also). my only question to the reviewers at entertainment weekly is whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it? or better yet what's it like to stand on a democratic podium?

" reason once had two things going for it. it articulated principled libertarianism and it was a consistently interesting magazine. now its ideology is fuzzy; certainly not consistently libertarian. it is also dull and aimless often badly written. case in point: the current issue as i write includes a defense of the fda by a writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians and who works for an organization that supports a prohibition on the sale of nutritional supplements as well as promoting state assaults on the tobacco industry. the old reason would never have published such a piece. nor would reason have previously published ronald bailey's article advocating mandatory health insurance. bailey also supports the iraq war and psychiatric coercion. a bright spot continues to be the writing of jacob sullum ",negative
" i never bought gq back in my 20s because for one thing i never thought of myself as a clothes-horse. also i actually took the g in gq to mean that it was actually for gentlemen ie sipping champagne on a yacht pass me the the caviar type gentlemen. well after now having reached a certain age i find myself going back and forth between esquire and gq and find that in many cases neither are exactly right for me. however i think i've bought my last episode of gq. the 2006 interview with will ferrel was interesting for the first three paragraphs and then it became an excercise in self referentialism disguised as an attempt at wit. also the politics of the magazine are unabashedly anti-bush administration which would be ok except for the fact that i'm not reading gq for political content. there are plenty of magazines out there make this their specialty and when i find it in gq its just tiresome. frequently swipes at bush and his policies just come out of nowhere in an article as if the editor decided that a jab at bush and his policies might help the piece regardless of its content. not to mention - does anyone actually wear the clothing they put on display? $800 tennis shoes? i fear that i will be an esquire reader - i can't bear to become a men's best life subscriber just yet ",negative
" i first subscribed to gq when it was still a quarterly...an issue only every 3 months. back then it was primarily a men's fashion magazine. it was sophisticated useful and classy filled with clothing men could actually wear and practical grooming tips trends and style. i suppose in many ways it resembled a ralph lauren print ad. now fashion is relegated to a few pages in the back of the magazine with men wearing things they seem to have found at a local flea market. nothing seems to fit properly patterns - plaids - stripes...anything goes. it resembles homeless couture. odds and ends that nobody should actually wear. sure the world has changed. but fashion good taste and quality are timeless despite tweaking and contemporary preferences. the editors may feel that grunge hopeless edginess for it's own sake and adolescent sloppiness sell issues. but they might be surprised that there's a huge pent up demand for sophistication and real style both formal and relaxed. i hope someone else picks up the torch.

" i used to love outburn magazine. i first discovered it when i came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain. the first thing i saw on the cover was vnv nation. i bought that issue and soon after that i ordered a subscription. what i loved about outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that aren't covered in the mainstream music magazines namely those in the goth ebm synthpop and industrial scene. unfortunately within the next year and a half the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands two genres i don't give a rat's behind about. i don't know wtf happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music i would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to. just like alternative press outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends ",negative
" i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. frankly the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters. a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers--to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view. unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story--any future coverage is designed to prove time's initial position correct. the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories--we told you so we told you so. even worse the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story. can't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn? out of sight out of mind is the mantra... in fact i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media; newspapers are failing television news can't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance. we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis. neutrality is dead. frankly i don't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant. time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states--no more. iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page. african states are making vast strides towards democracy we get an article about nigerian computer fraud. russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq. japan one of the world's most influential cultures in the week i originally wrote this review (see 12-month subscription) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling. somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein's puerile take on pornography and social deviants. but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks: how in the hell did our world become boring? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage--educate the reader about the world in which we live; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week. time has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news ",negative

" time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage and recent years have only accelerated this trend. in the 60s and 70s it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend (originally it was considered quite conservative) but as the years go by it's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance. as for its being part of the liberal media this is inaccurate. recent coverage of the (2004) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non-person. the first debate between john kerry and george w. bush was not even covered except for one very brief article listing a few fact check points. instead the cover story wa about new products and movies a kind of sharper image catalog lite. time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan. it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u.s. election but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine's ignoring a signficant world event that george w. bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office. in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment. the bias seems to be in favor of mr. bush but it's still mostly bland and superficial. your money is better spent on the british magazine the economist which is far more substantive. while its editorial viewpoint is conservative it's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent-revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u.s. politics. the economist also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i've found to a (dare i say it) fair-and-balanced approach to the news. time can still be entertaining to read but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously. they tend to bend with the political wind ",negative

" please read naomi jakobs' review for relevant magazine below. it captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the christian 'post-modern' kick. if you have to go out of your way to claim you're a celebrity then you simply aren't a celebrity (take fitness celebrity john basedow for example). in the same way if you have go out of your way to claim that the post-modern evangelical movement is relevant then you're claim for relevancy is simply not credible. the christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years. however pop-culturalizing evangelical christianity isn't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when sandi patty or carmen ruled the christian top 40. does the fact that some christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable ",negative
" admittedly i am slightly older than the relevant demographic. but i'm not 40 yet! so there are a number of things here that do have some appeal to me. and i applaud the magazine for attempting to address culturally important issues. still the magazine suffers from it's unrelenting fawning over the whole post-modern vibe and it's own sense of self-importance as a beacon for charismatic hipness. (hey look out world! we jesus freaks have ipods too!) usually the more something or someone sweats to proclaim their own relevance the more danger there is that they can become irrelevant. so like it's spiritual cousin charisma this magazine suffers from a somewhat shallow perspective on life and culture. it trumpets its ability to ask the tough questions even as it follows a relatively safe politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line. i mean their idea of being cutting edge was to put bono on the cover. if you want to be cutting edge put the libertine adam clayton on the cover and ask him about bono's faith. now i would read that article! (i am a major u2 and bono fan. i'm not knocking him; just the lack of imagination at relevant.) there's also way too much emulation of the world's perspective on generational heritage. hey we're young and we're smart and we don't need to do anything the way our geezer parents did it. i guess having a little gray hair or wrinkles doesn't cut it in today's paris hilton culture but i'd like to think that it might be a little different in a culture shaped by biblical values. actually relevant seems to be a little afraid to say what biblical values are (beyond the obvious politically expedient ones); it all seems amorphous here. i've never been a fan of the whole what's hot/what's not ethos. and i'd like to give a little more respect to today's christian young people to think they could handle something that didn't fall into that same faddish trap. i am hopeful that they may get it right yet with relevant. at times they seem tantilizingly close. but it takes more than a slick hairdo male earrings chin stubble idolization of youth culture icon quotations and psycobabble cool dude theological lingo to make one relevant ",negative
" i like to read cook's illustrated at the library. their magazine is much too expensive for the small amount of recipes included within. i like the tips sent in by readers and some of the product reviews. i have found that most of their recipes are very involved--nitpicky to be kind. the lemon meringue pie recipe--which i tried from their america's test kitchen cookbook--calls for cooking cornstarch in water cooling it and then beating the solution into the meringue. supposedly this keeps the meringue from destabilizing. all that happened in my kitchen was i found little lumps of cornstarch glue at the bottom of my mixing bowl while scraping out the meringue. i have made meringue before without cornstarch and can't help thinking this is an extra step that isn't neccessary. their best brownies are good but i can make equally good brownies without all the extra steps involved in melting chocolate and cooling it etc. if you're looking for easy fool proof recipes that don't take a gazillion steps and aren't fussy about exactly what ingredients you use this isn't the magazine for you ",negative

" i subscribed to cooks magazine some years ago back when it began publishing again. i had problems with issues that failed to arrive and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern. since that time i occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest. even by dint of casual glance i've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the perfect recipe for something or other. i now skip right to the perfected recipe and decide whether its worth committing to memory. some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare-brained at best. there are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me: 1. product reviews: they range from just plain wrong to idiotic. the kitchenaid pro 600 was hailed by cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores. yet the amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart allowing the metal gears to separate. christopher kimball (the editor) once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight. no i'm not joking. in that evaluation le creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy. all-clad even though it conducts heat very evenly suffered for not having as much heft and therefore was judged pricey on a pound weight basis. one issue of cooks boasted on its cover unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others. apparently hershey's was designated best. not too many months later callebaut was recommended above all others and hershey's was judged barely acceptable. feeling manipulated yet? 2. finally there are those dreadful editorials by mr. kimball. rambling painfully written and punctuated with a picture of mr. kimball wearing a bow tie and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it. mr. kimball is a humble man with much to be humble about. he writes as if he were chanelling helen gurley brown but in red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play. time to re-vamp this magazine folks ",negative
" cook's illustrated is the first cooking magazine that i'd found myself truly motivated to read cover-to-cover even though they do insert advertisements for their own products which i suppose to them makes this an ad-free magazine but i'm not surprised they've bent the rules with that claim. the one time i found it necessary to contact cook's illustrated about a customer service issue i was simply floored by the treatment that i received... i'll simply leave it at that. i personally don't intend on re-subscribing (fine cooking here i come!). you however may find that this is the cooking magazine for you. and as far as what they do goes cook's illustrated is good at what they do - i'll give them that. if you have not found this review to be helpful i'm sorry if i haven't made the value in my warning apparent. just know that there are those of us out there who have had bad experiences and are simply trying to prevent others from experiencing the same.

" i should preface this reveiw with the fact that i am an accomplished home cook. i have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks. i do not buy commercially prepared products like breads crackers mayonnaise or salad dressings. i make these items myself. i suspect that i am not the target audience for this publication. the may/june 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total. given that there are only 6 issues a year i was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages. the may/june 2006 issue contains the following information: simplifying moroccan chicken bringing home fish and chips grilled tomato salsa grilled london broil main-dish vegetable stir-fries how to cook pasta foolproof veal scaloppini a new twist on chicken salads garlic and olive oil mashed potatoes utimate turtle brownies best strawberry cream cake the scoop on vanilla ice cream a review of tongs if you are an experienced cook their isn't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you. this issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking. however i enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful. this magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook. bottom line i will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little more meat in their content. i think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive. i would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their best of cookbook instead. it costs about the same amount contains many more recipes has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer. additionally check out an issue of fine cooking which is another test kitchen type of publication just with more depth.

" back in the 1970's my grandmother subscribed to prevention. at that time it was a wonderful magazine filled with informative articles aimed at the prevention of illness and the promotion of wellness (as the founder of prevention j.i. rodale had preached). articles about the role of vitamins and nutrition were light years ahead of their time. (j.i. can be given a lot of credit for bringing vitamins and supplements to the mainstream). over the years and especially after the tragic death of robert rodale (j.i.'s son) and the takeover by his wife and daughter it has unfortunately transformed into a fluffy tabloid-like women's magazine with scantily clad women on the covers and one- or two-page articles instructing women to get killer abs and burn the fat. i think j.i. rodale is probably spinning in his grave to see what his descendents have done to butcher this magazine which bears no resemblence whatsoever to what it used to be. i flipped through a copy in disgust recently to note as another reviewer has stated plenty of ads for drugs which really seems to go against the idea of preventing illness in the first place (whereas the old prevention sang the praises of vitamins and health foods). i don't know why the rodale family doesn't just scrap the title and call it something else but alas they are a major corporation now and i have little hope that this magazine will improve any time soon ",negative

" i have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and i have become very skeptical of much of its advice. this advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g. the us dairy industry (there is always at least one of those annoying got milk ads) and not surprisingly every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products (e.g. milk and cheese). however having read many books on nutrition it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the the china study by colin campbell an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the us dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public's perception of the healthfulness of its products. it is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers' paychecks. the magazine also appears to be very similar to prevention magazine which i also have subscribed to and i would make the same criticism of. my advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent berkeley wellness letter that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the us dairy industry ",negative

" i have been a reader of businessweek for over 10 years. i have noticed that it has had a significant change in focus over the last year. while there are more articles on personal business the hard-core articles have gone the way of newsweek and u.s. news and world reports. the nature of the articles are lightweight and do not reflect issues important to decision makers today. like many others i have noticed a political slant or agenda over the last year. specifically their commentaries and economic analysis trend to the left. bob kuttner is co-editor of the american prospect and contributor to the boston globe. every one of his articles begins with the premise that the president's policies are bad and then is followed by a tortuous rational for that thesis to include discussion of the days of gold backed currency. andrea d'andrea tyson is better but as a former clinton advisor is not objective in her analysis. alternative economic opinions are far and few between and what opinions they do tout does not agree with the numbers stated in their own figures of the week. while bw has the potential for great reporting based on their resources they have let their editorial priorities get in the way of serious business reporting. for serious business readers and students i recommend going to alternative sources. and yes i will let my subscription lapse this year.

" i was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas. it isn't really and there isn't really that much to this magazine. it is just another tired old aoltimewarner publication just like time people or teen people. i looked at the august and september issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on elton john's out of africa fundraiser and the article on julian mcmahon. the rest of it was ads and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in vogue magazine but the same old ads you'll see anywhere else and they are annoying. there were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of kelly ripa (post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it plastic person syndrome) mark consuelos waay too much on jennifer garner and her baby and other weird things such as the trend of designer cupcakes. i wish i was kidding on the latter but i am not nor do i have $25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is jessica alba's favorite. there was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here. despite the size of this magazine there is very little to sink ones teeth into just way too many photos of the same old same old and tips for mimicking them. i am not interested in becoming a teri hatcher clone nor am i interested in seeing vanessa carlton's pad. this magazine is for you if you like excessive ads no diversity a subscription that is actually not a year (it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine) and your life's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in new york because some celebrity did. this magazine is mediocre at best and the worst part is it has the exact same fashion advice as vogue. i went with vogue because there is substance in their magazine and the ads are classy and very chic. leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at aol time warner.

" the legend goes that there was a time a few decades ago when the gramophone was the unquestioned authority for reviews of recordings of classical music. whether or not that legend is true (i'm too young to know) gramophone's time has definitely passed. today there is a multitude of sources of free information on classical music on the internet from newsgroups to websites. some of it is less well-informed than gramophone's criticism but some of it is more well-informed. what is undeniable is that for the price of a few mouse-clicks it is possible to find a far greater range of reviews of recordings on the internet than gramophone (with its british-based critics) can offer. what is more gramophone is tied to a business-model for the classical music industry that is fast becoming obsolete. historically the most important classical recordings were issued by a few so-called major companies such as emi deutsche grammophon and cbs (later sony). these majors would buy lavish advertising spreads in gramophone and so finance the magazine. in return gramophone would devote lengthy reviews to the majors' new releases and would produce pages of fluffy interviews with musicians under contract to the majors. today the situation is different. the most interesting new release is more likely to appear as a mp3 on an obscure russian website than on a new cd from sony. small companies dedicated solely to classical music recordings produce great results on shoestring budgets while the major corporations have virtually abandoned new classical recordings. this development causes problems for gramophone's business model. the new players in the classical music industry don't have the publicity budgets to fund a glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising. with gramophone's implicit bargain: advertise with us or we won't review your recordings the magazine seems to be becoming more and more irrelevant. if you want to subscribe to a classical music periodical i recommend international record review or fanfare. both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone. but most of all i suggest checking out the huge range of classical music information available for free on the web and usenet ",negative

" wired magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine: that there is a level of cynical style-whoring inaccurate myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely trading substance for style. wired is consistently behind the curve these days but that doesn't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know. in articles about controversial subjects one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that i find them offensive even when i disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall. just as often features which don't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them making fun of a person group or idea in a way that isn't enlightening or even humorous let alone warranted by the subject matter. generally wired is as mean-spirited as it is self-congratulatory. this attitude appeals primarily to the demographic of tech wonks and it industry tourists professionally and personally deflated by the bubble burst desperately trying to assert their relevance and relive their high-flying know-it-all glory. any content is easily outweighed by the sheer volume of half-truths shoddy reasoning and straight-up falsehoods which could easily be revealed and corrected by a casual investigation of the subjects treated in pages choked between high gloss yuppie/genxer-targeted corporate mind-poison (advertising). isn't the world of technology interesting and magical enough without mixing the spin double-talk and factual misrepresentation of a presidential debate with the impotent absurd bravado of battle bot pre-match trash talk? people know little enough about how tech rules the world and how it can quite plausibly save it. this magazine could evangelize for technology's promise and educate about its current and future potential. instead it concentrates on one-shots written in a style that passes for hip that forwards an attitude rather than a message with an emphasis on sensationalism over accuracy having more in common with advertising than edification ",negative
" i am a low income disabled person and require copious amounts of bathroom reading material 'wired' is even too tedious to fill that need. its sponsors tend to run the lengthy ads reminiscent of old picture filled national geographics of questionable scientific value. on the other hand the articles for example in the latest issue 'are higher gas prices good for us'(paraphrase of title) offer little information and if i had time to do the research this one is particularly like a sheaf of 1970 nixon press releases in conjunction with the announced operation independance. the intention at the time was to free the u.s. from dependance on foriegn oil. oh we of short memory condemned to sacrifice our sons and now daughters! of interest may be the dumb means by which i obtained an unending subscription to this and some other almost as pointless magazines playstation magazine - now x box magazine the completely amoral men's health garden club cooking. i simply check the highest income level on every form i fill out on the internet and everything else short of a tax form or loan application. typical of something recieved for nothing wired is not a publication for which i would recommend laying out any money or time. including bathroom time.

" this magazine just dares people to pick the most boring pretentious or ostentatious feature within any given issue. town & country is an extremely old money venture and while it does have some good and useful articles (and lovely advertisements for things that virtually nobody can afford) much of the magazine is essentially centered on a very elitist worldview that grows very tiresome rather quickly. town & country was initially recommended to me because of ostensibly good coverage of travel and architecture two areas i have great interest in. as an applicable aside when i read a list of tips in the offshoot town & country travel publication on ways to ease the stress of long range flights i realized there was a reality check due when one of the first tips was to always fly in first class ignoring the fact that the vast majority of readers would rather buy a car with what a typical first class ticket to europe or asia costs. as i mentioned there are some good articles and there are occasionally better and more useful offshoot publications like town & country travel that are eminently more readable (although they still insist on advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes on the coast etc.) i will say that the photography is always good and you can believe that if it appears here that it is the finest and most fashionable available: hyacinth bucket would no doubt like to be seen reading this magazine. despite having occasionally worthwhile features i find town & country to be excessively pompous therefore i recommend finding another publication focused on whatever area of interest you have whether it is fashion society or travel.

" home business magazine is a publication aimed at those members of the general populace who either already own a home based business or who have an active interest in the subject and would like to pursue it further. this magazine contains articles relating to all facets of home business ownership from the initial setup all the way through to the payment of taxes at year end. i read several different business magazines and many of them have to do with entrepreneurship. home business is the only one i read that is specifically devoted to starting a business in the home and unfortunately it has many flaws that prevent it from being the enjoyable and informative read that it otherwise could be. probably the most annoying feature of this magazine is the articles themselves and their tendency to be written in a list- type format rather than in a user- friendly way. i realize that people like lists but home business takes this a little too far. it makes the magazine seem callous and unfriendly- something you would consult in the same way you would an almanac. for example it is common to find a one page article with a title like effective ways to design a newspaper ad or how to obtain quick financing. in each instance these articles will have a short opening consisting of a paragraph or two followed by a numbered listing of different methods/suggestions to solve the problem or answer the question. this makes the magazine read more like a reference guide than a piece of reading material. another thing that is annoying about this magazine is the endless advertising. not only does it get out of hand it also includes all sorts of ads that emphasize money- making schemes and other similar material. advertisements with titles like really lazy guy's incredible little secret idea can make you rich free $9.95 report shows you how to make a fortune and six figures in six months clutter the pages of this magazine with get- rich quick garbage that everyone knows is unlikely to return even the cost of the introductory package. some parts of this magazine are more bearable than others and it's this handful of positive attributes that prevent me from giving this magazine a one- star rating. i like some of the success stories because they depict ordinary people who have succeeded at making a living with a home- based business. but even here the stories are inconsistent. some are educational in nature while others have little valuable information to share. and to make matters worse they are far too short- usually covering only one- half page each with a large advertisement taking up the space at the bottom of each page. speaking of the advertising this magazine wrote the book on advertisement excess. advertisements cover about 75 percent of the pages in each issue and it is rare to see even two pages in a row without some sort of advertisement. the ads are posted everywhere often right in the middle of an article and they distract greatly from the already limited enjoyment of the magazine. this magazine is assembled together in such a way that it reads like a collection of articles taken from people in different parts of the country that were shuffled around and published in one magazine. in other words this magazine has no continuity to it. it's like taking short articles from different business newspapers around the usa and then piecing them together into one magazine. starting a home- based business is a goal that many people set for themselves and there is always a need for some good timely information when you find yourself in this situation. home business unfortunately doesn't perform its mission very well. if you dig deeply enough you can find a few good articles. but the majority is too impersonal and too shallow (not to mention smothered in advertisements) to make this magazine worth the trouble.

" like where's waldo it seems every issue must have at least one if not several mies van der rohe daybeds. while this is admitedly a classic piece of furniture one gets the impression that there are a gaggle of designers telling their clients you have to have one of these they're what's in! most of the features in metropolitan home suffer from the same fate; dreary antiseptic homes with the same dreary interiors that obviously were foisted upon gullible uninformed clients by designers who know how to make an easy buck. modern equals of course a mies van der rohe daybed (notice how many times it shows up in this review?) otherwise you get month after month of 1970's florals faux louis the whatever tables. even using feature extraction wading through the dreck and finding something useable for your own purposes it's painful to look through this magazine. if you really want ideas for making your house reflect you trust yourself and what you like and if you do like mies van der rohe daybeds by all means get one. just don't plunk one in your sun room because you were told it's trendy. if you like the modern style look up the works of hans wegner and peter hvidt and go from there; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years of hard use by real families and is sturdy as well. maybe you want a house where nobody is allowed to set foot in any of the rooms and amounts to a bad hodge-podge of styles that all seem a bit busy and bumpy. for everyone else think about the things you'd like to see if you walked into a room save your money and skip this magazine ",negative

" interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it's not quite what i expected. with a title like interview i read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews. it turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine but it's not the only one. there is substantial space given to fashion movies and other areas too. some of these columns are worth an occasional look but they failed to grab my attention. the writers seem to play it safe and that includes the interview section. they don't ask many daring or controversial questions. they keep it simple asking questions about an entertainer's latest album or movie without delving much into their personal lives. interview has many general annoyances. my greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents. about half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads with fashion liquor beer and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue. the ads are everywhere with the majority in the front pages of each issue. the table of contents is buried and i find this very frustrating. the contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page then a few pages later proceeds to the remainder of the contents which is the regular monthly features. what's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents. it varies from one issue to the next falling somewhere in the first half. interview also varies greatly in length. some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long. the shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way minus any metal. this magazine centers on entertainers fashion music and the like. you won't find any interviews with politicians businessmen etc. interview sticks strictly to entertainers and that includes the regular monthly columns. you won't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry. you will find only articles about the stars themselves. interview's only saving grace is the photography. it would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing. but in many ways the photos are overemphasized and there isn't enough substance to the magazine. the articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material. overall interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material. my subscription was free and i'm thankful that it was. besides a few nice photos for clothing there isn't much to make this magazine worth the cost.

" flipping through the pages of writer's digest at a local bookstore i found some of its content to be particularly useful and interesting especially those on the trade of writing that could benefit the novice writer. so i decided to subscribe to the magazine and it was only then that i realise that problems do persist in this seemmingly wholesome and helpful magazine. since i have subscribed online directly through wd's website in jan 2005 i have received only a few issues. in the first few months for almost half a year i received no issues at all. it was only later then when i e-mailed them did they manage to get some issues through to me. the annoying thing is that even though i have e-mailed wd a few times on this problem they would reply apologetically saying that they will extend my subsription. how does this tackle the root of the problem? if they could not have assured its overseas subscribers a consistent service they should not have offered an 'overseas subscribers' option. ironically i received their letter asking for a renewal of my subscription recently with my home address clearly printed on the front of the letter. logistic problems aside the magazine does have its plus points. in the issues there are useful tips for writers not simply on the craft of writing but also on the business and spiritual aspect of the writing process as well. occasional issues also features insights into the lives of authors to give us an idea of how and where they work their opinions on life and the areas from which they derive their inspiration. all this from a range of authors from a range of genres. essentially the business of writing is also not left out. however the magazine is not one fraught without problems. the problem with wd is that the information presented to readers is too limited and scattered. each article though containing valuable tips on writing does not have enough depth to really improve the work of authors if they are really implemented. in addition because of its range it also does not provide what some writers really want consistently which can be a waste of time for them to read if they are subscribers. sometimes it does seem that the magazine is purposely limiting the information that they give to readers in order to encourage further buying of future issues. this for example can be seen in the amount of publishers' addresses that they offer. at most each specific article on a particular topic contains on average 7-10 addresses. there is nothing wrong with this but why would an author want to waste his time to have bits and pieces of such information when he can just purchase a writer's market collection of publishers(and agencies) addresses collected into one? and ironically again the same company does publish a 'writer's market' collection which is of excellent quality annually. that said the same problem - the lack of information and depth is also seen in the advice and tips it gives as well. to make matters worse every issue is usually cluttered with a plethora of advertisements that can be frustrating to readers at times. writers want to organise their time and information not add on to it. if you want are thinking of subscribing to wd do consider the alternatives that are currently available. writing is a craft that requires more common sense and acumen than many would like to think. however if you are not particularly concerned with little information fed to you in slower dozes or are not too worried about a little more untidiness in your life than this magazine might be for you. but do your research first ",negative
" writer's digest puts out a lot of great resources for writers. the magazine ain't one of them however. for starters about half of the magazine is ads - mostly for other writer's digest products. one you get past paying $19.95 a year for what's essentially a brochure you'll notice that most of the articles don't apply to you. most writers stick to one genre yet the magazine focuses on all aspects of writing - fiction poetry business writing editing non-fiction etc. if you're working on a biography of j. edgar hoover do you need to look at an article on poetry in the stlye of ee cummings? i'll take no for $600 alex. so now you're down to about 10 pages that might be relevant. well let's start chipping away at that: the letters about grammar questions are a waste: if you have a question about affect versus effect would you write to a magazine and wait a month or two or would you pick up your style guide and have an answer in less time than it took for you to read this sentence? thought so. (furthermore the idea that someone would write to a magazine with a question like that is so incredulous one has to wonder if the questions aren't just submitted by staff members in an attempt to fill space like i used to do when i was the news editor at my college paper.) writer's digest does review software and other technology that might be useful to writers. my favorite was when it reviewed microsoft word. thanks - i'm sure most readers had no idea about the monopolistic word-processing program. to be fair some of the reviews are useful although you can get better information just by looking up the product on amazon.com and reading the reviews there. if you're going to writer's digest for market information you'd be better served elsewhere: the annual writer's market publication has all the markets and is more thorough whilst the writer's market website has all that information and is up-to-date. your money would be better spent on those two products. about the only articles i have found useful are the profiles on authors and how they have succeeded. there you have it: two or three pages an issue that are useful. if you're trying to get your work published writer's digest has several other products that are a better investment than its magazine: go with the annual writer's market book the website and pick up a style manual of your choosing (chicago is the best). don't waste your money on this magazine ",negative
" while waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month (july 2005) i read through what i thought would be the familiar redbook magazine of the past. instead i was shocked to come across a new sexual advice section in which the explicit techniques for giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out was described. another article within this section explained how a taller man can have sex with a shorter female partner while both standing. i felt embarrassed and outraged that this magazine was out on the tables in the waiting room for any age group to read. i am age 48 college educated and the mother of 2 teenagers. i would not want my 13 year-old daughter to consider this light reading or helpful advice nor do i think it appropriate for a magazine such as redbook. parents please seriously consider whether you want this magazine on the end tables in your homes. it has changed ",negative

" i was a charter subscriber to this magazine when it started up publication. it was a breath of fresh air in a stagnant field of almost universally wretched photography magazines. over the years things changed. columnists died or moved on. editorial directions were switched. articles that once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers. when digital photography became dominant in the marketplace outdoor photographer was in the vanguard pushing every gadget and photoshop manipulation plug-in that popped up. the magazine became a wasteland of promises of better pictures if you just buy _____ (fill in the blank with whatever the current trend might be). what i thought was ironic at the time was that the best photographs they printed were being done by photographers using the least sophisticated equipment. photographers using film (!?) a lot of large format guys occasionally some black and white and stuff made with cameras just about any serious hobbist already owned. but these portfolios began to dwindle from occasional to rare to almost non-existent. at some point my interest in this garbage lapsed before my subscription. the magazine made a once monthly trip from the mailbox to the trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it. outdoor photographer impresses people who measure quality photography by whether or not the equipment used in production cost the equivalent of the gross national product of small third world countries. it offers little in the way of nutrition to a hungry mind. it's empty calories just making you want more and more while starving your potential. it truly is wretched.

" ...because that's all this magazine is: an advertising vehicle aimed at kids who aren't old enough to discriminate between ads and actual content yet. don't be fooled by the venerable national geographic name: this publications pays only the briefest lip service to educational content. when my son received it as a gift i was shocked to see that the ads were virtually indistiguishable from the articles. and in fact the ads were often much more visually interesting. the photos were excellent i must admit. but the layout was jazzed up to the point of absurdity as if designed to play to kids with minuscule attention spans. the science facts were sound but again the articles were cut absurdly short more like squibs and factoids than actual articles as if the editors believe that kids couldn't possibly focus on one topic long enough to actually read more than 250 words about it...or maybe because they didn't want to distract the kids from all that tantalizingly lucrative advertising stuffed onto every page. as an editor and a parent i am appalled by this magazine and would not recommend it to anyone. national geographic should be ashamed of itself for pushing this kind of junk on young readers. avoid this publication like the plague.

" my family received this magazine for years but recently we have decided not to re-new our subscription. this used to be a quality product but it has recently gone downhill with the inclusion of more and more advertising in each issue. at this point nearly half of the magazine consists of advertisements--this isn't the real science magazine it claims to be and is a waste of money. the content is not all that great. the articles are often extremely short too short for even a pre-teen audience. my kids often wished that this magazine included more serious science topics and not just shortened dumbed-down material. much of the magazine is full of fluff-- things like word searches and picture matching games which didn't interest my children. the content might be okay for 7-8 year olds and children at slightly lower reading levels but older children will be bored. all in all i'd recommend that you simply get the regular adult version of national geographic. though the articles might be too complex for children the pictures will make up for what they can't read. if you're looking for more of a children's-oriented magazine you're better off with muse a high quality general science magazine that is published by the smithsonian museum in washington dc. however muse caters to a slightly older audience perhaps ages 9 and up.

" this magazine is another part of the murdoch empire. its worst sin is that its boring and not very conservative. it was founded by william kristol john podhoretz and fred barnes to be a institutional conservative publication under tight control and with deep enough pockets to dwarf its smaller rivals. when conservativism was a living movement it was best characterized as a collection of independent voices who while they respected each other didn't always agree with each other. now following the murdoch formula its about getting as many people whatever their ideology on the payroll. the price of being on the payroll is of course not rocking the boat. reading conservative publications these days is like reading the transcripts of someone engaging in a monologue in an echo chamber. its strange that there is so much conservative media today but that most policy decisions don't get debated or even discussed among conservatives. they seem more interested in covering liberals than discussing ideas or making proposals. and for god's sake no more articles by those who are agnostics in their private life talking about how america needs more god this or god that. if your going to be religious at least find someone who is sincere. and no more articles on the greatness of family by childless unmarried women who are totally devoted to careers to the exclusion of anything else.

" i've been watching this magazine slide downhill for some time but they've finally hit bottom. the bulk of the april 25 2006 magazine was devoted to cars. yes todays automobiles are becoming highly computerized but the magazine is supposed to highlight the software and hardware that we use on our desktops. pc mag has been drifting far afield doing articles on apple computers gaming systems and extensive reviews on cameras. instead of pcs the subject seems to be anything that has a computer chip in it or is in some way remotely related to computers. the obvious inference is that there's nothing interesting going on in the pc world so they have to keep stretching just to fill the pages. i find that hard to believe; i think it's more likely that the staff has lost their focus or they've hired people who are not interested in or qualified to write about pcs. the lack of pertinent content makes the dwindling size of the magazine even more apparent. what used to rival a small phone book is now about the size of time magazine. they now have a new look and it's awful. their readership used to consist of well educated technically sophisticated professionals. these people don't need a dozen arrows pointing into every photograph with cutesy handwritten notes belaboring the obvious. that's more appropriate for the folks who had a hard time getting through high school and have short attention spans. compare this issue to the issues from a couple years ago and it's obvious that they've dumbed down the entire magazine. i've subscribed to pc magazine for years and considered it a must read to keep up with the rapidly evolving hardware and software of the pc world. but no more -- it's time to find one that has something useful to write on the subject of personal computers.

" i am utterly disappointed in the direction that gamepro has taken over the past two years. i actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year but came back to the 20 issues for $10 at their (10?) year anniversary. i forget. but the magazine is really bad. one thing i laugh is the retro corner. they have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago. i think the most recent issue they said: 140 pages? huh? i think my last issue was around 100. and don't try to tell me they've lost 40 pages in advertising. too bad on-line reviews and websites are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines. i'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life. or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low i can't stand it anymore. or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort. you guys were pretty good 5 years ago but you've gone to pot these past two years! i'm talkin' to you watchdawg!!! you guys are suckin' lately!!! mc white said: you guys are suckin'!!

" as you can tell by the title i'm not enamored of this magazine. i've been playing video games since the early 80s and have read many many gaming magazines. my reasons for this negative review of gamepro follow in no particular order: 1.) their numerical rating system stinks. 1-5 points is just not accurate enough. most mags/web sites have a 1-10 system with decimals. not gamepro. 2.) the written part of the reviews are way too short and often are written borderline incoherantly. it's as if they hired the proverbial 1000 monkeys to type them out. 3.) often times they cram two or three reviews on one page. screen shots provided with reviews are often the size of a postage stamp. 4.) the number of ads in relation to content is distinctly high. once when i was bored i counted all the ads in one issue. out of around 110 pages there were 60+ pages of ads. 5.) their article layouts are confusing and occasionally they print on colored backgrounds that closely match the text color. forget about reading it if you're colorblind. 6.) their gaming tips are either so obvious that a brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out or plain don't work. i suspect that the ones that do are ripped off from various web sites. 7.) gamepro costs the same as better gaming mags such as egm and game informer. so in closing... if you want a good gaming magazine just about any magazine other than gamepro would be an improvement. many great gaming magazines have come and gone why a turd like gamepro continues is a mystery to me ",negative

" my mom was a subscriber to newsweek for years and i'd flip through her copies. most of the material is friendly towards the powers that be (although not friendly enough according to the review by the soldier who thinks the editors should be in jail. so much for protecting our freedoms). anyway since newsweek is beholden to big business advertisements it won't do much to rock the boat that our corporate mafia owns. if people are interested in more honest more critical views of the political and economic system that is causing so much devastation in the world (the neoliberalism of the us empire and other wealthy nations) then i'd recommend z magazine. i'll never forget finding my mom on the floor devouring it's articles on a range of issues the corporate media marginalize. z also publishes articles and interviews with the most-cited living author on the planet noam chomsky (another figure i'm sure the us soldier thinks should be in jail. although chomsky recently spoke at west point. so even the military is waking up to the hard truths he brings).

" first off i have to ask amazon what keeps happening to my reviews? if one is too critical of a product do they get deleted? as a peace corps volunteer i am a forced subscriber of this rag. that should upset every american taxpayer that foots the bill for this garbage. i would like to pint out also that peace corps volunteers (not your most conservative bunch) has continually lobbied to get rid of this magazine in favor of the economist. every week i receive my copy and page through it for 5 minutes. it then hits the burn pile or the trash bin (which ultimately gets burned). i literally feel dumber every time i try to read an article that looks interesting. they have six page articles with all kinds of diagrams and illustrations that end up revealing far less than a 3 paragrah story that the economist presents on the same topic. i am just waiting for when news weak starts introducing pop ups for their thought weak readers. as a former soldier i was enraged that the irresponsible and criminal reporting (koran desecration) of this magazine caused the deaths and injuries to so many. newsweak's cowardly apology made me want to puke. to the editors and writers that allowed that piece to go to print i hope it haunts your memories forever. why you are not rotting in prison i will never know. freedom of the press carries with it a responsibility to facts and is not a license for editors to print whatever they want. one cannot scream fire in a crowded theater and then try to hide behind their first ammendment rights when there turns out to be no fire. the economists this magazine hires seem to have been kicked out of the london school of economics for being even too liberal for their tastes. hey if you haven't seen the obituary from the 70's keynesian economics is dead. the cause was failure to stand up to free market realities. looking for credible and up to date articles in this publication is akin to watching scrambled porn in the hopes of seeing some skin. even if you do see something it will be so distorted you won't know what it is that you are actually seeing. do yourself a favor and get something else. the economist the wall street journal hell you will be better informed if you consult a magic 8 ball anything but newsweak would be better. well almost anything in newsweak's defense they do not normally subscribe to conspiracy theories or decry the so called corporate controlled media as do other journals of utter nonsense. this magazine is liberal propaganda disguised as journalism. the really sad thing is that people that read this think they are informed on world events. do yourself a favor and go to a newstand and read an economist. one warning though intelligent writing and sticking to facts and reality is highly addictive.

" i decided that i had to write a review about newsweek this morning after i came across yet another biased over-hyped cover story. this particular one is entitled rethinking the marriage crunch and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman's chances of getting married later in life. this was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around and neglected to have any on this occasion. i really think another reviewer's comparison to people is quite apt but newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue. two years ago we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning infidelity chic. yes it seems according to their sources spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue without even a hint of contradiction that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before. i find the magazine to be [...] as they offer opinion instead of news; theirs is a mission of persuasion. overall there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool.

" a great magazine. i had a subscription for 2 years that ended about 6-8 months ago. i paid $104 for the 2 year subscription back then but suddenly the price in the us has skyrocketed astronomically. i can go to any music store or a borders/barnes and noble and buy each individual magazine for anywhere from $8/issue to $9/issue typically and i have never seen it more than $9/issue. however suddenly the subscription they have is like $13 an issue which is outrageous. it's not amazon's doing either i was a subscriber for 2 years and this same thing happened to me. they asked me to come back at a lower rate (something like $99/year) which is still $8.25 an issue. sure that's might be a bit cheaper (about 25 cents an issue on the average price above) than buying each one in the store but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually especially at tthat price. the upside is that uncut is far and away the best music/movie magazine in the world. i'd say about 60-70% of the issues i would have bought in the store when i was a subscriber. but until they begin printing the magazine in the states it's just not worth a subscription. the writing of the magazine is superb. brilliant and varied writing throughout. each magazine is about as big as a small book too and of them i'd read a good 80% of the magazine too (even finding myself reading some articles about artists i could care less about because the articles were so well written) but the price is way too high to subscribe. it's a shame too. rolling stone is nowhere close to being as good as uncut and although mojo and q are strong they can't hold the candle to it either. the only blemish on the magazine itself (for all you who might want to buy a single issue) is that the covers tend to repeat every 3-4 months and i mean how much beatles can i read (and i'm in the upper 5% of beatle freaks out there). still the magazine is well worth it the subscription price is too incredibly high though to recommend in any circumstances. i would think this would be a great market to move into in the us if i was in that position. i don't think rolling stone could compete anymore. if it would make things cheaper i would do away with the free cd bonus too. aside from a few listens and the novelty of it all (the free cd was a good incentive to make me interested a few years back) the cd's get old quick and after a while i would toss them out after a quick preview. summary: wait until/if the price drops but don't subscribe. it's too expensive and much cheaper to buy each magazine individually. the magazine itself though is 5 stars and almost always great ",negative

" spin is an accurate name for something like this -- a lot of hype for an innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine. if rolling stone is the dirty old geezer of rock magazines then spin is the teenager who tries hard to convince you he's cool by name-dropping the strokes. spin covers some of the same turf as rolling stone and blender but less lasciviously -- lots of coverage of popular bands. some of them are quite good -- the hives for example or indie newcomer steve burns (who quit his job on blues clues after hearing a flaming lips album and reinvented his life as a rocker). unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands are hot at the moment and then overemphasize them again -- as well as tacking them up in whatever coolest/best lists they chalk up for the year/decade/century/history of rock. indie cred is maintained by a few half-page articles on potentially hot bands like the comas and metric but this info is halfhearted. it's like they're reluctant to tear themselves away from articles on better-known bands regardless of talent. the writing however has that certain affliction that a lot of major rock magazines have: the need to be cool. their writers always are trying to be funny but rarely come across that way. it seems silly and strained like a soccer mom wearing a spandex tube dress. even the cd reviews are mediocre. however one recent highlight is dave eggers' columns -- witty funny and a little bit skewed. in fact they are often the best things in the entirety of the magazine. one of the problems is the emphasis on stuff in hollywood. scarlett johanssen is a wonderful actress yes. but she doesn't sing nor has she appeared in a music-based movie -- jack black yes scarlett no. and what is up with party coverage on tv starlet mischa barton and mtv couples? check out sublimely indie mags like chord filter under the radar and the online kludge for in-depth looks at some worthy bands. as for spin? it's still trying to convince us it's cool but eggers is the only regularly cool thing about it ",negative

" during the 1960's when my sister subscribed to ahmm the stories mirrored the fantastic television show; the stories were primarily mysterious creepy and unique with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great. now the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain uninteresting detective stories. i subscribed up until about the early 1980's but stopped because of the same old boring cops and robbers material. i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm hadn't changed. subscribe only if you are a fan of pure police fiction ",negative

" i picked up an issue of this magazine last week because i wanted to take the picture of the cover girl into my hair dresser. after i got it home i opened it up to check it out and discovered it is the most brainless magazine i have ever seen. the articles read like something from teen beat yet it's filled with adult material. there were about 10 articles on how to please your man and what guys like and even a sex workout. these articles didn't contain any real advice--just unintelligent babble. for instance did any of you know that guys don't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex? hmmm crazy. anyway i don't see how anyone over the age of 16 could find any of this stimulating and yet there are too many articles about one-night stands for anyone under 18 to read. but if you're still into taking quizzes and looking at half-naked hunks who have barely hit puberty then this magazine is perfect. i would have given this magazine 0 stars but unfortunately it's not an option ",negative

" once thought of as a women's health magazine cosmo has taken a twisted turn into pointless redundancy. at one point cosmo seemed to be a must-have along with water and oxygen. more and more lately it seems that the magazine is posing the question how can we survive on only water and oxygen and still be sexy while we do? ocassionally a featured article faces the issues of things ranging from eating disorders to politics but few and far between. they don't seem to realize that on the other side of the page for the eating disorder article is a woman who wears a size 0 and is still unsatisfied with herself thinking that she must conform to some heroin-chic fad. fun fearless female - articles about real women who make a real difference - is great. it shines the spotlight on someone who not only is beautiful and successful but has enough education and talent to succeed in the world without needing a man. if the magazine featured more of these things maybe it would be worth my subscription fee. but tell me when the last time is that you saw a cover not featuring the phrases mind-blowing sex how to satisfy (insert breathing life form here) or barely-there which seems to refer to not just underwear anymore but everything. this isn't a magazine about women's health anymore. it's all about how to keep your man happy while still conforming to social standards in fashion weight and financial standings. i'm sorry but the girl on a budget can't afford a $430 skirt or uncomfortable shoes with the uncomfortable price of $300+. cater more to the real woman; not the one who only cares about her relationship status pant size and bank account ",negative

" i subscribed to hobby farm and after reading two issues i cancelled it. i read an article in the march/april issue about show birds. then i got my may/june issue. don schrider the communication director of albc wrote in to correct the story. the article claimed over 1000 birds at the show the correction was 11640 birds were present. the other correction was regarding earlobe color and egg shell color stating there are exceptions to the red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs. in the mar/apr issue i read an article about guinea hens. in the may/june issue i read another letter from a reader (dana manchester a member of the guinea fowl breeders assoc.) correcting the article in the previous issue. apparently guineas aren't the watch fowl they are portrayed to be but fall victim to predation often. dana manchester also corrected the mislabeled photos of guineas. these may be small errors but how goods is a resource that isn't reliable? if errors were the only issues i may have given the mag 3 stars but the article on manure management in the may/june issue was lacking on many levels. the advise in a nutshell was buy a manure spreader that you can pull around your field fill'er up and drive. one word of caution according to the article- only use well rotted manure in the garden but there wasn't one word on how to rot manure. i liked the article about smaller breeds of cattle bigger is not better may/june but we'll have to wait for the next issue to see if any readers step forward with corrections. i am not waiting around. there are a lot books and magazines dedicated to small farms. i like mother nature news and i just subscribed to countryside (my nephew recommended it he owns a small farm as well). i also like john seymour's book self-sufficient life and how to live it. he has an upbeat attitude with a can-do spirit.

" (pseudo)scientific american's treatment of lomborg's the skeptical environmentalist is nothing short of disgraceful. with this blunder sa has seriously damaged their own credibility and exposed how politically motivated they really are. it is indeed sad that science has come to this. please visit greenspirit dot com for more information on their bully tactics when faced with what should be openly embraced in science: dissenting opinion. i guess that by making increasing sensational and apocalyptic claims about the environment they think they can sell more magazines - clearly on this point they are right which is why the magazine's title scientific american is indeed fundamentally ironic. scientific american is behaving in a manner that is both unscientific and un-american. they should be promoting the free exchange of ideas but instead they are threatening scientists with lawsuits for daring to question their opinions. this reflects the unbridled conceit that permeates the extreme environmental movement today. they are convinced the world is coming to an end and no amount of facts or statistics will sway them from their self-righteous dogmatism. - patrick moore co-founder greenpeac ",negative
" this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports. their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be #1 in ranking. often the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that isn't relevant or doesn't make sense or the review isn't consistent with the posted viehicle stats. the magazine also seems to be biased. some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful. after further reading of many issues you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers for example you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically trash and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews. ultimately its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period. its the pat robertson of auto magazines. if it were possible i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star.

" i've been receiving this magazine for almost 4 years now. it hasn't changed much since i started receiving it... and i pretty much still think of it as the worst teen magazine that's still in business. i'm 16 now and haven't liked it anymore as i've gotten older. the strangest part about this magazine to me is the fact that they just keep sending it to me! i mean i barely even remember when i was first subscribed to it (it was some kind of deal where you can get certain magazines for like 6 months or something and i didn't have many choices so i picked this one). eventually the other magazines stopped coming. but this one continued to come. and still does! i would have thought it might be nice if a company made an accidental error or something and continued to send me a magazine. i would have been thrilled if that happened with any other magazine (i actually don't mind seventeen allure cosmogirl teenpeople occasionally or even teen magazine.). but this one just makes me wonder if these people are downright stupid... the least they could have done is accidentally send it to someone who likes their magazine! if that person exists? i think i read a fairly broad variety of teen magazines these days so i'll try to discuss my dislikes about it in relation to those. so this is a comparison of this one versus: seventeen cosmogirl ellegirl (i suspect it recently went out of print however) teen magazine teen people magazine allure cosmopolitan and jane magazines. 1. overall value conclusion: teen vogue= very low value and overpriced. smaller size first off one of the easiest things to see about this magazine when its on the shelf is the fact that it's smaller then the others. all of my magazines are about the same size. except for this one; which is maybe as much as 2 inches shorter in height and 1 inch smaller in width. i don't know why the magazine makers decided to do this. in my opinion it only draws more attention to the fact that while it is around the same price as the other magazines... they had to cut out at least something to make it smaller. sounds like a rip off to me. (...but i'm getting it for free for some reason so i guess that's hardly my biggest concern. it may be yours though). cost compared to content magazine prices can be a little missleading at first glance. it's easy to find a thicker magazine and assume that more pages = better value? but that's not the case. the abundance of ads in a magazine can lead you to that conclusion but there's a good chance you'll be disappointed when there are hardly any articles in between ad after ad after ad. by the way... for those of you who aren't familiar with teen magazines these days i hope you realize: they all have ads this is the truth but i don't see it as a terrible thing personally. when i was 11 and i first found an issue of teen magazine at the library i was shocked at the ad content. but i used to read american girl magazine (which had no ads) so i thought it was so bizarre. now i don't mind it. i even save some of the ads because i like photography and looking at different angles of things. i don't think it's fair however to hate teen vogue solely because of the ads though as all the magazines are going to have ads. the amount of ad content in each one is the main thing that varies; so here's my interpretation... seventeen cosmogirl - limited ad content (they have more ads towards the beginning and then they're much more spread out. seventeen is probably my favorite magazine of the bunch and they manage to get by with one ad opposite of an article for a few pages and then a stop the ads for a few pages or so before they do it again. i find it highly tolerable) teen magazine - even less ad content. (i think they've really decreased the amount of ads over the years actually. they probably have the least ads of all my magazines) teen people ellegirl jane - more than seventeen and cosmogirl but not terrible. allure and cosmopolitan = high ad content. (i almost put them seperately but they are similar. they have a lot of ads i think but for the most part i don't mind. they manage to balance most of it out with enough articles and pictures to make buying the magazine worth while. the main difference i see is just in the choice of ads. cosmopolitan puts in so many ads for sex related things and has many more vulgar ads. allure i like more anyway. and i guess cosmopolitan as a magazine focuses a whole lot more on sex already so many teen moms may not appreciate their daughter reading it in the first place.) teen vogue = high ad content i'd say the ad content was very similar to the ad content in cosmopolitan and allure. however the thing that pisses me off is the fact that there isn't enough content to balance it out! (maybe i mean meaningful content but more on that later...). the saddest part about this magazine is that i save more of the ads then i ever save articles. the ads really are more exciting then the content unfortunately... 2. articles conclusion teen vogue = fluff filled unimportant to me now generally i consider seventeen to have the best articles (with cosmogirl in a close second) along with maybe allure although it's addressed to an older crowd. reasons why i actually take the time to read the seventeen articles although i hardly even bother with the teen vogue ones: a. seventeen writes about something that actually interests me (ok ok so occasionally they have a little stinker. but overall i think they do a good job.)teen vogue... does not. i'm interested by things i haven't thought of before or personal accounts of things that i would be unsure how to react to issues that seem to happen everywhere but with stunning new facts enclosed and statistics to give me a perspective... etc. i could go on. but unfortunately i don't think teen vogue has managed to intrigue me. ever. a typical teen vogue article is something like the truth about crystal meth i was being bullied online! blah blah. i can hardly even think of anything i've ever been interested by. they have a tendency to focus on things that i already know are bad things like drugs especially. it makes me feel like i'm being babied... like hey well i bet you didn't know this.... if you do this your liver could turn black and blue and all the colors of the rainbow and then pile a bunch of tear jerking stories of teens who had no idea of the dangers of _____ drug and then something terrible happened. i mean i think it's important that teens see the dangers in doing such things... i just get annoyed rather than enlightened when it seems like such an easy and obvious thing. particularly when they make a big deal about it being so unknown and mysterious like nobody has ever heard of it before when i know that most of the people i talk to every day do anyway. if i don't take the freaking drug... i won't have to worry about all the problems associated with it and sometimes it's hard for me to be sympathetic to these girls who screw their lives up (especially when in the article they make themselves seem like complete idiots!). i'm not anti drug articles though either. when seventeen did one a while back for example it was an article (or maybe more of a chart?) of drugs that make you ugly. now that i found enlightening and very interesting. it didn't focus on one drug but instead on one effect that many different drugs cause. not only do i want to use the drugs less i also feel like i'm more able to recognize the signs of its use so i could identify the signs. it's important to me that magazine editors take the time to teach us something new without beating us over again with the same stuff we hear everywhere else. teen vogue just hasn't figured that out yet. b. i find the good advice in seventeen meaningful. teen vogue... makes me wonder if i should be the one giving them good advice... i think i was most disappointed with teen vogue on this when they did an article that caught my eye about girls who are addicted to tanning. they spent nearly 2 whole pages rambling about different girls and their tanning habits (and general stupidity...). and barely even gave the reason why it's not a good idea. i remember reading one of the last sentences in my head over and over again. it was like remember to live your life and have fun but try to be safe. i mean wtf??! you could be talking about anything with that. cooking driving sex... it's so generic that it's stupid. the only thing that i got from that article was a justification that there really are a lot of stupid girls who are damaging their skin to be tan and have no idea about it. unfortunately if these girls read teen vogue they will probably never know either. 3. features conclusion teen vogue = ...are you serious? um. i can't find a better word than worthless to describe this magazine's features. i used to like the a room of my own thing that they had at the back of my issue. it was nice to be inspired by the way that other girls kept their rooms based on what they liked. but in the last year... i think they managed to totally kill that part too. the uniquenesses and interesting things that once intrigued me a little have been replaced by more mediocre rooms by other girls (lately they've been somehow connected to a famous person. yeah how exciting... not) that just don't inspire me at all. oh and one of the second to last pages or so there's a feature where they find some girl with style and tell her to describe it and what brands she likes... blah blah. occasionally (well no rarely) there will be something that i actually find interesting and want to save to remember. but most of the time it's just a bunch of 13 year olds trying to be trendy by throwing on the coolest things they know... all at the same time. no thank you. in most other magazines i can appreciate a monthly space for something about hair or makeup or something related to beauty that i could find useful. teen vogue does not do this. but then again everytime that i have seen them slip something along those lines in they manage to make me question their intelligence. (omigod mom! teen vogue says i should put glittery pink eyeshadow up to my eyebrows so i can be cool. we have to go spend $67 now so that we can have the exact product that they used! eek.) the makeup is useful... if you want to be a stage artist perhaps? i don't know... i'm still working on that one. 4. the fashion focus conclusion teen vogue = fashion help for the extremely wealthy and confused if you disregard the fact that virtually everything in the magazine is rediculously overpriced and just unpractical... i suppose someone might find their fashion sense useful/inspirational somehow. but i'm afraid i do not. i remember skimming through one article that answered a question asking how do i avoid looking like a tourist on vacation? to which they answered with showing how you can pile on a bunch of random clothing pieces and come off as an idiot instead. how exciting... they also have a tendency to encourage readers to buy things by showing us models wearing such clothing. i wouldn't be surprised if the plus-size community completely gave up on them in fact i'm surprised that there is no outrage over this. look teen vogue i know gemma ward looks excellent in that (ok i'm lying... but i can pretend right?). but you see me and gemma we have some differences. for example... her thighs are probably less then half the size of mine she's like half a foot taller then me she weighs maybe half of what i do and... well... she's a model that seems to look good in everything. i do not. and i refuse to let you convince me that such a hideous outfit won't look hideous on anyone else. actually i wonder if gemma ward could afford the things in their magazine. she's a super model afterall. but maybe after spending $150 on each pair of underwear... things begin to add up even for her. darn... the bottom line: don't waste your money on this magazine (in fact don't even get it accidentally for free like me it's not worth your time). if you want to buy a teen girl a magazine subscription try something like seventeen cosmogirl teen people etc. just about anything is better than this.

" so i'm mostly with other folks on the content. if you get lucky the small sampling of product reviews will include some item you're looking at (or should) and the anemic review will prompt you to follow up at the manufacturers website. the buyer's guide was of decent breadth and useless depth on the bikes. no bikes from gary fisher the inventor of mountain biking. huh? i'm primarily interested in mtb and the issues of mountain bike are good. but you only get 4 issues and the content is redundant between the two magazines (or even within each mag). for instance the may mtb issue had a story on rebuilding trails in los alamos (i actually really like their reviews of specific places) and the cover also boasted a great american trail guide. one of the four trails talked about in this great american..guide: los alamos. i can spot a cut and paste job when i see one. also in that issue the bike that started a revolution about the sp stumpjumper. a great idea for an interesting article that was butchered into a condescending comic strip. also having ordered the mag for the issues of mtb i was disappointed when they didn't even show up. emails with customer service resulted in one of the more disappointing did you not read my email type exchanges. two months later and i now have one of the two missing issues in hand. they have great photography and i have yet to find a better option but i'm really disappointed. i won't renew ",negative

" on the whole bicycling is a huge disappointment. i agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good but i don't pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two -- i read those in the newstand. further as i will mention below once and a while there is a real gem of an article. in the meantime almost everything else they do is poor. the entire magazine is pitched at the readership as though we were all budding pros training obsessively and fighting with that last 1% of body fat. the reality is what bicycling's readership principally is is rich -- in their own pages they recently listed average household income of a subscription at $115000. so it's not people with the ability tor ride like the pros ride it's people with the ability to buy what the pros ride. the result is a majority of articles and reviews that focus on just this -- $3000+ bikes (and as one reviewer said the occassional review of more reasonably priced choices around $1500. wait $1500 is *not* chump change?!?!) advanced training and eating techniques etc. as opposed to real world riding -- centuries and club rides touring commuting (gasp!) etc. even it's racing coverage is terrible -- its recent spread on the san fran gp one of the three most important races in the us was 6 pages of photos 4 of which were of people watching the race not the racing itself. for me though the worst part is its hypocrisy. in a recent issue there was a truly excellent article on what the author called invisible riders -- low income laborers who depended on their cheap bicycles to get them to and from work sites everyday. yet: the author mentioned several times (albeit with embarrassment) that he was riding a seven while doing research on people whose lives depended on $100 bikes; the author commented on the significance of these riders commuting everyday a movement which riders like bicycling readers had never been able to mobilize (maybe because they all drive to work and the magazine does little or nothing to encourage bicycle commuting); and the five bikes reviewed in that issue ranged from $3500-$7000. really really sad. one star for invisible riders and the like and that's it ",negative
" during the 1970s bicycling was a great magazine with lots of in-depth articles about bike tours bike racing and bicycle technology. the magazine zoomed downhill through the 1990s into the worthless rag that it is now. the articles in the current version of the magazine are very superficial and lifeless. many are thinly veiled press releases from various advertisers. if you really want to learn about road bicycles and bicycling a much better magazineis *cyclingplus*. for mountain biking try *bike* or *dirt rag* ",negative
" having regularly read bicycling for many years (even when it was called bicycling! in a tasteless 1970s way) i find it surprising to see how much the quality of the magazine has declined. in spite of all those people spending huge amounts of money on fancy equipment bicycling has become thinner and thinner. it has recently improved somewhat after most of the editorial staff was fired and a sign is the dropping of the truly horrible marginal comments (bike love and so forth) but it is only suitable for real neophytes. unfortunately there is no other single magazine that covers racing bike touring test reviews technique and fitness in north america no matter how poorly. the articles are very short and sometimes well just stupid. there is very little on cycling destinations or serious equipment tests. the photography remains decent but compared to the german magazine tour for example bicycling is a pretty sad effort. if you can read this you have access to the internet which means you have far better sources of information to draw on. i am letting my subscription lapse and advise you to save your money. a big disappointment bicycling has not advanced with its readers ",negative

" unless you want the editor's liberal political views shoved down your throat avoid this magazine. it leans to the left so hard that you have to lie on your side to even read it.

" cooking pleasures magazine is the magazine produced by the cooking club of america. i very happily joined cooking club of america and began receiving this magazine quite a while ago. the club offers so much to its subscribers but as time wore on i could see that the marketing department was a tad too aggressive for my taste. the cooking club of america offers their potential members numerous items to entice them to join. members can take part in member-only contests where kitchen products and gift baskets are some of the prizes. they can be sent food items or kitchen products to review. they can also receive a cheese grater for joining! there are some nice photographs in this publication. the recipes are not complicated either although they do require some unusual ingredients and some that are very expensive that many people would find hard to locate. i personally had to forego some recipes and others; i had to order a couple of ingredients online because of the reasons given. the cheese grater sent to you is a nice idea but being it is a rotary grater you have to squeeze very hard to get the cheese to grate. also the grater is made of plastic and eventually snaps in half after using it only a handful of times. the club also offers you a culinary resource directory. the information contained in this directory is not difficult to find in a basic internet search. you can also receive standard sized blank recipe cards. unfortunately due to the size of recipe cards i do not believe anyone can even write the ingredients onto them without running out of space. also part of the member benefits is to sample products for review. potential members can see photographs of blenders ice cream makers and much more. while a member there for three years i did have the opportunity to review quick rise yeast and a chipotle spice. both were nice products. they were not the glamorous photos of kitchen appliances but it was something! currently they are offering a visa credit card with their logo. with this card not only can you use the card like any other credit card but also you can receive club discounts. if this is something that appeals to you see the club for details. approximately 3 months after you renew your own subscription they start mailing you about how you should renew your membership for the following year now so that you can help them keep club costs down. after just paying for the current year i was not interested in paying for another year already. an idea may be to not contact members so soon after they just paid their subscriptions. that may save the club some money. i have caller id and i utilize it all the time screening my calls to specifically avoid telemarketing calls. imagine my surprise when i pick up a call and it was a representative for cooking club of america. i was actually pleasantly surprised thinking i was about to embark on another benefit of being a member. i was most disappointed to hear the mono-toned voice on the other end of the line reading the script suggesting i become a lifetime member now. when i tell them i am not interested they have a new deal for me. when i still tell them i am not interested they have yet another deal. the calls continued after this conversation for another couple of months. at this point my subscription has expired. i was relieved as the telemarketing phone call really turned me off. you should have been there to see me receive my credit card statement. cooking club of america automatically charged my credit card with my next subscription without my permission. it was three months after my original subscription expired! as you can imagine this was extremely upsetting. upon doing my research for this article i have come to find that others have had similar experiences with this magazine. it's a shame too as this magazine has plenty of potential. unfortunately their marketing department could utilize different tactics in maintaining their current membership. despite this magazine being very affordable i recommend that you save your money on this one and try fine cooking cuisine at home or cook's illustrated. not only do these magazines provide better recipes more professional tips they also do not call you daily to get your money ",negative
" the magazine is very nice with color pictures and recipes that look okay but that ingredients are either rare or expensive the magazine is too fancy and it's hard to find what the recipe is like. they don't put a review you have to tell for yourself. and plus if it doesn't have a picture you have to guess what's in it. i rate it one star. i'd rate it a half star if there was such thing but there isn't. i wouldn't buy this magazine ",negative

" i am 14. i used to read this about two and a half years ago. it was a pretty good magazine back then with health tips some real life stories and even things like sex questions (which is saying alot more than some of these other magazines.) it wasn't packed full of teenyboppers and cheesy glitter makeup. i liked it and if it was still the way it was i'd probably still be reading it. but now it's gone. i read my last issue one year ago and gave it up. it got way to young for me. all they talk about is celebrities (aka jojo good charlotte hilary duff jesse mccartney usher etc.) alright two of them make some passable music but what about the others? they're talentless! plus i do not see anything that would appeal to anyone over the age of 13. they refer to guys as hotties and babes and they just put the same person on every five pages! there are stupid quizzes to tell you your kissing type or how psychic you are (seriously.) half the magazine is huge posters for your room of airbrushed teeneyboppers. if you want a magazine with real substance try seventeen (highly reccomended) cosmogirl teen vogue and maybe teen people (i don't know it's kind of lost its fun factor.) some of these magazines may not be appropriate to the people that read this magazine but i personally think it is better for young girls to learn the hard honest truth about the world than to be obsessed with pop stars and the latest mary-kate and ashley gossip.

" i must say that i've read just about every teen magazine on the market and this is by far the worst one i've ever read. however at this point in my life everything appears superficial and immature. i first picked up twist when it debuted on newsstands. i believe that was in august 1997. i was nine then and looking to be fashion forward among my girlfriends who were still into the jungle gym. because of my insane desire to be cool and because twist wasn't too hard for me to understand i loved it and bought it religiously for about a year. my obsession with it slowly faded as the magazine got progressively worse and i didn't pick it up again... ...until my junior year in high school. looking through a then-current issue of the magazine i noticed that the way in which it was written was made to be comprehensible to a nine year-old or the lowest common denomination of older teenage readers. what i'm trying to say is this magazine is totally dumbed-down. it doesn't give girls any credit for being able to think creatively let alone read above a fourth-grade level. i also found the content to be more childish and superficial than other teen magazines (although they are all superficial to an extent - that doesn't mean they don't make delightfully fun and entertaining reading to share with friends). therefore i recommend this magazine to tweens (9-13) and tweens only. but even they can do better than this magazine. older readers should check out the somewhat more sophisticated 'elle girl' or 'cosmo girl' my two personal favorites. p.s. i agree with one of the other reviewers who pointed out the numerous spelling errors in the magazine. possibly my biggest caveat is the constant misuse of the apostrophe (i.e. tuesday's instead of tuesdays).

" the only reason i subscribe is i found a free subscription somewhere. the magazine had some interesting articles but most of the time they are just completely wrong. one example was a preview to last years nfl draft. they talked up terrell suggs in a long article to the point he was definetely going at the latest third even with the quaterback needy bengals and the lions who really wanted rogers were finding it hard to take a pass at him. where does he end up? going to the baltimore ravens. not even his homestate team the cardinals wanted him. another example is the cover of the their college football preview. they picked auburn to be their national champions. i don't follow college football enough to understand but i know auburn lost its first two games and doesn't look much like a team vying for a national championship. i'm not saying that sports illustrated is perfect and their picks are always accurate but they seem to me to get a better grasp on sports. yes sports illustrated has ads but looking through my last issue it doesn't seem that the sporting news has any less. it takes a while till you get at least two consecutive non ad pages. it seems like they both have the same amount. and even if one had more ads than the others is it that hard to really turn the page? are you that lazy? the articles are the important thing and not many people say that the ones in sporting news are better. i'd like to hear what some people thought were so nonsports related in sports illustrated. i personally haven't seen anything non sports relat1ed. yes they have reviews of the occasional sports themed book and movie but they are usually short just letting fans know whether its worth it ",negative

" saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from food festivals to very easy-to-make recipes like blueberry pudding. while there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials. while reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like chicken fried steak. yes this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for olive bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills. after reading this magazine i'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything i'm putting in the oven. the recipe for stuffed tomatoes and summer squash had me wishing it was october again and the recipe for fig jam reminded me of my childhood in africa where we had a fig tree in the backyard. saveur is filled with nostalgia entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. with amazon's gourmet food section we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" saveur has been a guilty pleasure for me for some time. guilty because it is hard to take serious a magazine with such a hoity sounding name... and admittedly some of the travel-and-food stories are just on the edge of self-indulgent self-concious behaviour. they laugh at me at home (or used to) for reading it. what makes it good is the content. the cover story each issue is usually a destination article focused on a particular area and its food (cuisine is the wrong word here) written in a personal vein with beautiful photos and this is the heart of the magazine. but the other content is equally beautiful and it is amazing how many of the recipes actually are useful and have become mainstays for me... not just something good looking. hide the cover if you must but i think this is the best foodie magazine ",positive
" old mac usr new mac usr matters not. there is something in this magazine for everyone. and icreate has a pretty good online usr forum too. ",positive
" the high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the united kingdom. a subscription over there runs about twenty bucks. however even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside icreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials. top-notch magazine and highly recommended. just wish imagine publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this as-well-as a few other of their excellent magazines here in the states ",positive
" great magazine couldn't recommend it any higher for anyone starting out with macs. icreate also introduced a great pro section in 2005 to delveinto the workings of proapps such as final cut pro photoshop mdvd studio pro etc. now here's the thing i'm wondering how the magazine can be available for subscription while the magazine was put on hold late last year. me or anyone i know with a subscription haven't recieved the mag for months and there has been no contact from the people who handle the subscription despite zillions of e-mails. so be careful get the full story before you hand over any money!!!!!!!!!!! check the web for similar storries you will find the ",positive
" you bet this one is. there are only a few mac oriented magazines out there and they all wish they could be this well written. this is a large format magazine and each issue is filled with a series of how-to articles that i consider the best written best illustrated and easiest to follow. i can slog through some fairly dull reading but this is the magazine i would give to my wife / daughter / co-worker to explain how to use ichat hook up an isight camera customize ical get started with safari and so on. they review many new software tittles and the latest hardware goodies. since it is a magazine the reviews are very current. each issue comes with a cd and they are starting to include pdf copies of prior issues great for reference ",positive
" i subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and southern accents is the best bar none. the houses featured are absolutely dreamy--the photography is gorgeous--and while the magazine doesn't offer how-to decorating ideas there is so much inspiration. i find it to be intelligently written...which is rare in a decorating magazine. the articles on antiques are particularly informative. this magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful classic design--whether or not you live in the south ",positive
" as an interior design student i find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration variety and creativity. this magazine is more about art and design than advice on do it yourself decorating or cheap furniture finds so: do not subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one-two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different more practical purpose ",positive
" i was very surprised by the reviews below because i found this magazine absolutely wonderful!! the articles range from architecture to renovated homes to specific garden types to the average home owner. i found so many great ideas and inspiration in this magazine as well. the pictures are great and i find myself tearing things out every month! fantastic for anyone interested in design art or interior decorating ",positive
" i've read the new yorker since 1963 and though it seemed a better magazine then it is still a very good magazine now. as magazines go it may even be one of the best this nation has ever published. for good writing reporting cartoons and opinion one can do no better than this well known magazine. and their occasional special issues offer abundant pages that double their weekly issue. i don't believe any issue in all the years i've read it hasn't had at least a couple items of interest with some of the issues being read from front cover to back. try a copy it might just be for you. semper fi ",positive
" although i often disagree with the 'new yorker' politically and find the writing of seymour hersh offensive i believe that the 'new yorker' publishes exceptionally fine pieces of non- fiction. i stress the non- fiction because this is what interests me in 'the new yorker now'.once it was the fiction of salinger singer of s.j. perelman. but in recent years it has been the writing of malcolm gladwell adam gopin and a number of others. this is without speaking of the special feeling of class the new yorker gives its still topnotch cartoons the 'on the town' feature and the first-rate 'talk of the town ' calendar ",positive
" i have read this magazine on and off for a several years and wanted to add my 2 cents. yes the magazine does have many ads for business opportunities. but this is exactly something i want to read and evaluate the marketplace of business opportunities. many of these are franchise opportunities which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start. the articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful but not all. the value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process. it was not until i read the e-myth revisited that i understood the value of these franchises. this magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy. the magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise. hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there ",positive
" it's true that entrepreneur mag is loaded with ads--but those ads can be interesting in themselves. i always find it fascinating to see what ads pop and what ads are junk--and it's easy to see the difference. this is an opportunity to develop your own advertising strategy! as for the content there is certainly room for improvement. i personally enjoy the entrepreneur profiles though i wish they were longer. i would like to see more meat here. having been in business for several years now i find the most value in this magazine comes from the front section where they list interesting tips new products and survey results. not a month goes by that i don't bookmark a page so i can follow up on a new product or check out a website mentioned in a short piece. for that alone the low subscription price is worth the investment. there is a lot of information on franchising which is great for those interested in this business model. though this is not my personal cup of tea i still find it interesting to read the lists of franchises and notice the trends in popularity. who knew there were so many pet service franchises available! sure it could use more real-world advice but i still consider this one of the best general magazines available for entrepreneurs. not every topic can appeal to every reader since we all run different kinds of businesses and seek different information. if you're looking for something more specific to your industry a trade magazine would make more sense. but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you can keep an eye on the climate of the small biz world. ",positive
" i love this magazine! it has up to the minute need to know celeb news. honestly most of the time what they say in these tabloid magazines turns out to be true- jessica simpson split and brad and angelina jen and vince just to name a few....also there's movie/dvd/music reviews makeup and fashion tips and the clothes they have in there are affordable so you can dress like your favorite celeb. i look forward to each week getting this magazine ",positive
" i've been playing video games since my atari 2600 (and my lucky neighbors calicovision) and i'm happy to say that someone who grew up around the same time decided to start a magazine. at play they go out of their way to show games that they think are great but that are never going to get any press anywhere else. also since the mid-1990's i've been into anime but have only been able to go by word of mouth or more recently by what i see on tv (thank you anime and cartoon network). now i have play to read as it has extensive 20-30 pages of quality anime reviews. the reviewers are more than competent and may actually posses brains unlike the reviewers in most other game magazines. they realize that their reader is not only the thirteen year old grand-theft tony hawk player but also people like me who need humor and intelligence in my reading material. finally the quality of printing and lamination on the pages will make you want to keep each one forever and i have reread and consulted past issues over and over. thank you play for giving me something other than bills to pull out of my mail box.

" what is not to like from cover to cover. all beautiful models and international models. great magazine ",positive
" i thought my first issue of your magazine was a little sparse. it was a very thin issue. the models were beautiful. this was good.but you knowif you would include more in depth articlessuch as really in depth stuff about skin and hair. like i said before aging skin needs more done to it and some things like micro-dermabrasion could be helpful. also 8 glasses a water a day is the most helpful thing a woman could do for herself. beside plastic surgerytheres not much for them to do. but i will saythis to enlarge lips i put a vitamin e capsule on my lips and then honey and then a good lip moisturizer and leave it on overnight. it doees make the lips plumper. also i use baby powder on my face as a face powder. sometimes i use this just on my nose and chin. sometimes i use half mayonaise and conditioner and mix them together to make the mayonaise smell better on the hair. sometimes i use vitamin oil in my bath water such as vitamin e a person can buy this at the dollar store. im not rich but i do some things to help the way i look at my age. then you could include pictures of mountains and rivers and stories of people . then you could have articles on celebrities like frank converserobert blakereally interesting ones like that. paul newman has always got something to say interesting. also what ever happened to actor richard hatch who starred in the hitchhikers? someone told me the other day that the most handsome actor there was or is was yul brynner. i didnt see that as i should. i dont know if you agree with that or not but it would be interesting to see a profile of the way he lived .i like brad pitt and those people are always great. i love jennifer anniston because she she is higher up than most women in her thoughts and actions.angelina jolie i really like too beacause women do like these women. i miss johnny carson and they really need to find someone to replace him. yes there is people like that still in the world. ive found some of them. well thank you ",positive
" harper's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine second only to instyle. it is great and packed with great fashion. it actually does have some good articles too that i thoroughly enjoy reading. (the articles are much better than the ones in elle.) if you can only get one sub get instyle. if you can get two get instyle and harper's bazaar. it is well-worth the money ",positive
" harper's bazaar is the very best fashion and high style magazine out there nothing compared to the always disappointing vogue. better fashions editorials articles that i actually want to read and keepsake editions that are just classics. the true bible if you want to be in style ",positive
" i watch cnn too. when there is a big story i get parts of it on cnn then newsweek comes and it fills in with a larger story the bigger picture in a way that i understand. then i relate to other news sources as a more informed listener/reader. if it in fact has a liberal bias i have not detected it but i tend to have a slightly liberal bias myself so i can't speak to that. i buy time on the newstand when there is something that seems to be particularly well covered in time. i do not consider newsweek lesser. i used to take time years ago. now i prefer newsweek. the only complaint i might have is that both magazines seem to be having more magazine or feature type stories that i do not see as news and am not interested in. i think that is driven by these magazines (both time and newsweek do it) attempt to find out what works in this expanding world of media. ninety percent of those human interest subjects are not my interest and that annoys me. but the few that speak to me yes i will buy a magazine for that. for instance if time has a good article on the older groups of people in america i will buy that single issue. at the same time i am usually disappointed in whatever is featured in either magazine if it is not news driven. newsweek has been my news magazine that comes in the mail for years. for me it remains my choice. mary p jones ",positive

" print magazines are behind current news by about 3-4 months. the websites have news about new digital cameras instantenously. the print magazines are destined to be 3-4 months behind. if you are looking for the latest news you will get them tape-delayed if you only read magazines. however this magazine goes more in depth than some other ...popular magazines. the reviews are actually 4-5 pages long not one-page politically correct recaps of the feature lists. (still nowhere near as technical as the web reviews). having said all that and understanding the limitations of print magazines this is a good affordable magazine to read if you are interested in digital photography. it has some useful and helpful information reasonable reviews and some interesting articles ",positive
" this magazine is so delightful! fantastic tutorials-great photos and wonderful info. i enjoy it very much and wouldn't hesitate to subscribe again. i heartily recommend it ",positive
" after reading several digital photography books and going to grad school classes... i found this magazine to be far superior to anything published in this country. there are many articles on artists workshop-type tutorials as well as the latest and most fantastic hardware and software for the digital fan. i believe this magazine has something for everyone... from beginner to more advanced at relatively low cost. in addition i have found two other british publications digital camera world and digital photography techniques (both at www.dcmag.co.uk) that i would strongly recommend for those who can afford them ",positive
" this magazine does a great job of featuring good articles at the beginning and then breaking down events you might want to do in new york city that week. the magazine is organized into various categories that are color coded so that when you get it you can just skip to the section you're interested in. there's a whole city out there to discover and tony can help point you in the right direction ",positive
" fhm is absolutely gorgeous! hot and sexy covers great entertainment and fashion info. men lifestyle is discussed in this magazine. make sure that you subscribe yearly to save up cost ",positive
" ah the men's magazine. so many out there where to draw the line when it comes to subscribing? ultimately it boils down to what is worth the money you are shelling out and for me fhm is a cut above the rest for the following reasons. 1. articles are more intelligently written less sophmoric and delve on a wider array of issues. 2. paper quality is high glossy and sturdy while other magazines feel like cheap pieces of newspaper by comparison. paper feels like the same paper used by playboy. 3. quality of women featured. fhm has by far a higher quality of women. maxim tends to pull from a rung lower on the quality ladder while fhm features beautiful sexy intelligent and funny women whose interviews are actually readable. 4. fhm top 100 women special. wow. worth the money right there. [...] only negative with subscriptions is that these companies will send you last month's issue and count that as one of your 12 issues. that is annoying ",positive
" this magazine is one of the alltime best mags for men. it has everything you want including hot babes cars gadgets and sexy bikinis. it is also very cool in that it can turn you on to some cool stuff like the new watches they showed by fossil and dkny and some excellent martini recipes and then they turned me on to a dvd called new sex now which has greatly enhanced my reputation with the ladies. i for one am hooked.

" in touch is a weekly glossy magazines that retails at newstands for $1.99. it is very similar to star and us weekly. they offer fodder on the hollywood flavor of the moment so expect lots of stories about julia roberts britney spears brad pitt jenifer aniston j.lo and the usual suspects. it is very worth the newstand price. they rarely if ever have human interest stories most of the stories are all about celebrities style make-up or fashion. they also have contests some times. a lot of times i notice they run the same stories and pictures as us weekly so if i had to choose between in touch and us weekly 1 year subscription is less i would choose us because it still seems like they get more exclusive stories that in touch. also some of the news they run sometimes is weeks old i often think they end up filling space close to print time. it's an okay magazine an worth the cover price ",positive
" touchstone features articles editorials book reviews and other material from the perspective of protestant (both mainline and evangelical) catholic and orthodox christians who hold to traditional orthodox understandings of christian morality. it tackles the tough issues of our time both in scholarly articles and practical advice for parents who must raise children to be faithful in a post-christian culture. while it does not seek a false ecumenicalism which demands unity at all cost (see the july/august 2003 issue on christian unity & the divisions we must sustain) it also recognizes that orthodox believers of all three major branches of christianity must work together on moral issues on which we all agree. the publisher the st. james fellowship also produces an excellent devotional guide: the st. james daily devotional guide for the christian year available by subscription though [...] ",positive
" touchstone is one of the better magazines/journals to discuss and debate the meaning of the mind and heart in the contemporary world by standing on the shoulders of those who have struggled with this perennial question in the past. the editors numerous in number are orthodox roman and protestant christians who take seriously the creeds and scriptures of the church. in other words they realize that tradition is the glue that holds the church together and by extension sanitizes and sanctifies culture. first things is also an excellent journal that you will want to check out as well. enjoy!

" this is one of the best dog magazines of all time. the issues just keep getting better and better. this magazine goes beyond purebreds and honors mixed-breeds as well. it has wonderful rescue-related stories. one of the other reviewers compared the quality of the articles in this magazine with that of npr. that comparison really opened my eyes as i have for years enjoyed and appreciated the quality and fairness of the information provided by npr.

" conde nast traveler is a magazine for the wealthy or the want-a-bees. the magazine is geared mostly to north america and europe. it tells where to eat shop or be seen on the two continents. for example an article will inform the reader of a new five-star sushi restaurant in florence italy. thus if you plan to travel to florence for sushi (not michelangelo) this is the magazine for you. it is a great coffee table magazine for the armchair traveler for the pictures are gorgeous. ",positive
" this is a great travel magazine - wonderful pictures and stories. it is also much cheaper than the equally wonderful travel+leisure so that makes conde nast traveler a better deal. be aware though the items in this magazine are not very cheap unfortunately. go with another magazine (arthur frommer's budget travel) if you want to find travel baragains ",positive
" i was in the travel industry for years and found cn to be an excellent albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations and all other aspects of travel whether upscale or backpack. yes it is not encyclopaedic and yes it is chock full of adverts. however the latter brings the cost of publication no doubt and the former allows cn to cover a wide array of topics in each issue. their travel product ratings are next to none and shortlists the selection process allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions ",positive

" i am not a big magazine reader -- never have been never really had time to! however a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read...after falling in love every time read it i finally i had to get a subscription of my own! this magazine covers everything! it's got tips for life cooking decorating organzing and getting the best deal for your money. a lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas for instance are stuff that i use and apply to my normal life. for example: the july 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler. the result of that recipe was a wonderful dessert for my family of four that took me... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great! they don't endorse products nearly to the same degree that most magazines do and when they do it's in an article where they had comparisons done...always a recommendation and usually more than one. the important thing here is they don't say buy this product they say buy products that have such and such feature make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair and oh here's an example of what we're talking about. they make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme. so in conclusion if you're like me and can use a few extra ideas about everything in your life...this is a great magazine. the information is helpful applicable to normal everyday life...and it's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers ",positive
" this magazine compares favorably to &quot;american heritage&quot; with its interesting and accessible but well-researched accounts of the past. each issue focuses on a person (i just read the story of thomas aquinas--and hadn't realized his fascinating interaction with muslims) or a movement (the huguenots who's sad history led to their dispersal from france to all over the world--including the revere family moving to massachusetts). all in all an intriguing glimpse at how christians of the past continue to influence us today ",positive
" what i like about this magazine is that the articles are unique and informative. i have bought the last three issues and can't wait for the next one. this magazine covers equipment in a current mode rather than a 6 months to a year behind style so familiar with many of the other photography magazines. this magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time i have picked one up. every article is telling me about or showing me how to implement the lastest techniques from the best photographers in the industry. at the beginning of this year i noticed that some of the popular or modern digital review magazines were running the same old head to head comparisons of consumer cameras that have been out for the better part of a year now. i need to see the technology that is cutting edge or even around the corner. so far this magazine is giving me the best bang for my buck. good luck ",positive
" after having subscribed to peterson's photographic for several years i'm now hooked on this new magazine and am going to let the old subscription lapse. i've gotten tired of all the articles targeted at beginners. digital photo pro digs into the meat of photography a little deeper. some examples of articles which i've enjoyed are discussions of how digial imaging sensors work and how ink jet printers work. in the most recent issue is a good article on using the unsharp mask in photoshop. also i've enjoyed the large section on new products in each issue. one caveat is that there is some nudity. you may or may not find this objectionable (my wife is in the former category :). also there is usually an article on glamour photography or glamour photographers in each issue. even if this isn't your cup of tea there is still good stuff to learn in those articles. the magazine is beautifully published with very high quality paper and printing. it's also nice and big. www.jpwphoto.co ",positive

" first off most people don't buy this magazine in order to salivate over what they don't have but desperately want--at least i don't. this magazine is a wonderful inspiration for those of us who are interested in making the most of our home and free time. isn't our home supposed to be a haven? someplace to return to from the hustle bustle and craziness of the day and just relax and spend time making memories and creating joy in our lives and of those we love. this magazine simply caters to people with that ethic. it's always full of ideas--both trendy and traditional. it's not full of buy buy buy! hyper-consumerist propoganda--it simply presents current trends and new ideas to keep your haven fresh and fun. anyone with a lick of sense and an ounce of self-respect doesn't turn to home magazines looking to be led like a sheep into the latest buying frenzy. most of us are smart enough to flip through the pages and get ideas of things we like and then find clever inexpensive ways to incorporate them into our own lives--on our own budget. this magazine is always full of beautiful pictures great advice and even terrific information about how and where to find bargains. mainly though it's about making the most of what you've got and using your free-time to truly enjoy life to its fullest. don't fall for the neosocialist rhetoric of the first review. this magazine is worth every penny ",positive

" from a subscription point of view (about $12/yr directly) this magazie is a decent value. while half the information is fluff (looking back - 15 years of innovation etc.) there is some timely relevant information hard to find easily in a consolidated way. the focus is not just on laptops but mobile solutions - this includes peripherals pdas mobile phones among others. there is some opinion (riaa vs sirius) but the focus seems to be vendor/advertiser driven. for example the cover story of the mar 2006 issue is on first four core duo notebooks. they review centrino duo notebooks from acer dell gateway and hp. they run benchmark tests and provide charts etc. fairly useful info. except they don't give the information consistently. the weight of dell laptop is not even mentioned while those of others is. they do mention a few cons for each notebook but do it gently without a strong opinion. two of the four systems reviewed are selected as editors' choice. the other two still are rated well. there is no single table that compares them all in a single view. you get the feeling they were trying to please the advertisers and avoided any direct head-on comparision between multiple products. i disagree with their choices as well. how could the editors' choice be a 6.6lbs laptop from acer that has an average battery life just because it offers some value? in the same mar 2006 there is a review of windows treo 700w; a showdown between slim phones moto razr v3c and samsung mm-a900; a short test of nokia's pocket internet appliance and kodak's first dual-lens digicam; wifi routers; list of restaurants for business travelers; etc. for a $1/month i recommend this to anyone who travels a lot and is looking for a quick update on the mobile computing world. if you want in-depth technical info stick to toms hardware or other web sites ",positive
" laptop magazine is an excellent resource for the mobile professional. the staff has done a great job of reviewing products relevant to those individuals attached to their laptops and related gadgets. despite the name the magazine is not merely about laptops but also the tools and strategies for the peripatetic white-collar worker. with information on laptops mobile phones hotels and airlines laptop magazine is loaded with great insights. its layout is excellent as it appears far less cluttered than other computer magazines - much like how the harvard business review differs from star magazine. yet it is a bit light on specific computer tasks and tweaking. this may be due to the demographic of the audience which is most likely a collection of mid-level executives and sales professionals instead of hands-on technology gurus. as such the magazine is well worth the read as it will certainly save time with your work travel and technology purchases in the future. pros: excellent product information great organization and layout cons light on nuts and bolts computer technology no concise source of the laptop reviews (i.e. like motor trend has a summary of tests with dates and results with every magazine).

" i've been to a lot of concerts met a lot of bands seen a lot of hype seen a lot of scandal. this magazine is pretty much the best source of any up-and-coming band that you may be hearing on the radio or seeing on mtv. not only is spin the best magazine for music for kids my age (22) but the picture quality is some of the best quality that i have seen in any magazine. i have framed pages out of previous spin magazines because they were pictures i wanted to keep forever. i would recommend spin magazine to any fan of indie rock especially. death cab for cutie the shins and the flamming lips are just some of the bands that are talked about in spin magazine monthly. spin magazine does include some rap/hip-hop music that i try to avoid but the indie-rock and rock band information that i receive is some of the best.

" i've been subscribing to paste for over a year now and it's a great magazine. i agree with what others have said about the writing: the interviewers often seem in love with their subjects and deal with the musicians as fans instead of as journalists. there are tons of reviews in each issue on a wide variety of bands and music and the sampler cd and dvd are worth the subscription price all by themselves. it's a great way to listen to bands that you would never have heard otherwise. if you love music and are spending a small fortune on cds this magazine is for you. my only real criticism of the magazine is that it is very text heavy with tons of small print jammed onto each page often with a background picture/design behind the words which makes it a chore to read. i would love to see larger print and less eye junk on the pages. then again i'm closing in on 40 so younger eyes may not find it as problematic ",positive

" the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u.s. constitution thomas jefferson once wrote: i read no newspaper now but ritchie's and in that chiefly the advertisements for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper. [letter to nathaniel macon january 12 1819] the nation is not a newspaper. rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment tv doesn't dare to. those americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call the nation left wing liberal radical etc. etc. plato had written 2300 years ago his allegory of the cave: behold! human beings living in an underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. plato's punchline was ... and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him? and so dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans cannot stand to look into directly. it is much less painful for them simply to say: ... the nation's political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world - situation. for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation. it prints the patriotic incisive truth.

" i'm one of those people who always looks up product reviews before buying anything so it was on a leap of faith that i bought natural health magazine without reading anything about it. a friend suggested it and since this particular friend has never led me wrong before i caved in and bought the july/august 2005 copy immediately. let me start off by saying that i'm an extremely picky person. i have extremely high standards for every purchase i make and i absolutely will not cut a manufacturer any slack if i find a fault. now that i've gotten that out of the way i will mention that i was thoroughly impressed with natural health. long ago i subscribed to new age magazine (now known as body & soul which i do not care for). it was among my favorites solely due to its wide variety of content and true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips and advice. i cannot stand redundancy incorrect information and excessive advertising. i found that natural health was much more long the lines of the former new age magazine filled with dozens of little gems that make it worth much more than the $3.95 i paid. to give you an idea of what the magazine includes here is a small sampling of the articles i found in the july/august issue: small articles include: - to bee or not to bee a breakdown on aromatherapy ingredients that include bee pollen royal jelly propolis and honey stating just how effective and natural these ingredients are. - how can i get relief from pms? experts (including a naturopath gynecologist and dietitian) answer this question with excellent responses. - medicine cabinet: attack of the weekend warrior natural remedies and aids for those like myself who love to be weekend warriors. - clothes to pose in great yoga gear! - medical breakthroughs - healing supplements: 8 ways to beat anxiety - fitness fix - knee savers longer articles include: - healthy appetites: savvy strategies for eating well delicious healthy recipes and tips. - good medicine: a clean healthy mouth a well-researched article on mercury fillings fluoride toothpaste and the best at-home remedies. - five paths to peace five simple meditation techniques. - eat to beat the heat: yin foods more great recipes! - sacred spaces - making your home your personal retreat. this is only a sampling; in fact that's less than half of the magazine alone. some articles are fairly short but provide just the right amount of information to get the point across. my personal favorite was the last page make one change where this month's change is to upgrade your z's. it included simple tips that i was able to implement immediately. the amount of advertising seemed slightly less than usual (probably about the same amount as you'd find in a yoga journal but not nearly as many as in oprah magazine) and they seemed to be in line with the natural health focus. judging by the past reviews on natural health it seems the magazine had a bad run in the 2003-2004 timeframe. let's remember that magazines change editors frequently. i found none of the past complaints to be true in this issue but that may not be so in future issues years from now. as for me i want a subscription asap ",positive
" as someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier organic way of life i decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter. many did not strike my fancy. for example i found organic style magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste while mind body and spirit fitness seems a little too redundant and doesn't cover natural and organic living at all. natural health however falls somewhere in between covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet natural remedies beauty and food/recipes. as someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy i appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer. though many of the articles do cover ideas and products that aren't entirely natural or organic i still find them to be useful. many items and articles though not all are vegetarian-friendly as well as eco-conscious which i appreciate. one of my few complaints is that the articles can be short sometimes merely glossing over many topics. however if one piques my interest it can be a decent jumping off point to do further research. though i can't compare with the previous version of the magazine that everyone else seems to have preferred as i only began to pick this up at my local whole foods market in the last year i can say that i am impressed with what natural health has to offer it's readers. sure there are several ads plaguing the pages but i still feel as though there are far fewer advertisements than many of the magazines on the shelves today. besides some of the ads have led me to decent products i would not have known of otherwise. furthermore at this price how can anyone really go wrong ",positive
" i guess i don't have the agendas of other reviewers. i prefer to use organic foods healthcare and body products and find this magazine offers much useful information on alternatives to conventional offerings. i am not familiar with the old natural health magazine maybe it was more earthy-crunchy or something but i found nothing offensive in the new format. i would recommend this magazine to my mother and my siblings and friends who i'd like to see dip their toes into the world of natural health/beauty/food products. just be aware that not everything in here is purely organic. i find this magazine much less offensive than organic style which in its last issue had models wearing leather coats uber expensive consumer goods and advertising from merchandisers who are definitely not on the organic band wagon ",positive

" the good -------- * this is a nice magazine for the price. * it has some informative articles which maybe useful to newcomers to photography in general or the digital aspects of photography. * if you are getting started in photography or you are at a beginner/amateur level this magazine can be very helpful as a stepping stone * if you are an experienced amateur/pro you can still like this magazine but don't expect many in-depth/advanced topics. * the monthly lens reviews are helpful to slr/dslr users * for people who like to flip through magazines and even look at ads from different vendors this is a good resource. the not so good --------------- * the technical reviews of digital cameras are skin-deep compared to the in-depth technical reviews by the online photography sites (such as dpreview). * sometimes the reviews are word-smithed in such a way that they avoid saying negative things so -at times- you have to pick-up on what is not said in the review in order to figure out if there's something wrong with a product. * the news are 4-12 weeks behind real time. * if you expect in-depth or pro-level articles those are rare. consumer beware segment ----------------------- towards the back of the magazine there are plenty of ads from various mail-order vendors. some of them are very reputable honorable and reliable vendors such as b&h and j&r. however some other vendors are less than stellar - to put it in mildly. you will recognize them by the too-good-to-be-true super-low prices and they usually practice bait & switch among other things. these have been documented on various websites and photography forums. if you are not familiar with all these and you see prices that are very low you may want to do some research before purchasing ",positive

" american heritage is a fine magazine brought to us by the same publishers who bring us forbes magazine. it is a magazine that examines history in all shapes and forms examining past events and cultural changes that have shaped the american nation. one thing about this magazine that you will notice right away is that it is not just a magazine about american political history or the type of history that you remember from your school days. it does talk about this type of history but it also includes stories about music art and other topics breaking them apart and explaining how and why things happened the way they did and how they compare to the present. it also points out facts from the past that are more obscure making for some very stimulating reading. current events are also covered in this magazine and in these instances american heritage discusses present- day phenomena from an intellectual and critical standpoint often comparing it to similar events in the american past. this helps to keep the magazine current and more in- tune with important issues of the day. history buffs will love this magazine and so will those of an intellectual persuasion. the articles here are more thoughtful than other magazines and many of them require greater concentration. for these reasons american heritage is not really a casual reading type of publication. it is intended for those who like to read think discuss and debate. it's one of my favorite magazines of its kind on the market today.

" when i was little my dad always said good things about this magazine. my attitude was always &quot;i'm not gonna buy a magazine to bore myself some more&quot; - i mean c'mon it's a history magazine. i was absolutely wrong. i picked up this magazine one day and i was hooked. i would say that american heritage has found its way to make history interesting. one way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest (as subtle as they may be) into its articles. on the second thought i should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not. this magazine keeps me awake - sometimes i would put my paper/project aside just so that i could finish my copy in one sitting. it's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months. american heritage makes history grrreattt! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20's like myself ",positive
" i just wrote a review for opm and had forgotten about this magazine. i also used to subscribe and had recently let my subscription run out. i will not say it is not because i do not like this magazine but because i am trying to save some money. but the fact is that this is probably the best multiplatform gaming magazine on the market. the reviews are smart and fresh never hackneyed or cliched the way a lot of other magazines are (and some of my reviews sorry guys!). but the introductory article in each and every magazine by the chief editor always sounds like it has been written by a harvard grad with a layman's ability to make everything easy to understand. he has a way of making every article within the magazine all come together. never biased they are not afraid of telling it like it is in their reviews. i would highly recommend subscribing to this magazine and like somebody else mentioned better to go directly to the store and get the discount card. after $150 - $200 in used game purchases it pays for itself. highly recommend! mc white said: if you're a gamer than you gotta have this magazine! edit: believe it or not when i got home yesterday just after writing this review i had a copy of the september issue in my mailbox. i had forgotten i had called customer service about a missed issue. they were nice enough to extend me a two issue subscription free of charge to cover my missed issue. i was quite impressed and tickled pink when i got my newest copy in the mail when i arrived at my posh homestead. thank you game informer for continued excellent service and a wonderful magazine.

" in the world of gaming there are specialized magazines for each system (playstation magazine xbox mag etc.) most of which suck because they only report on (duh) games on their respective systems. others like electronic gaming monthly encompass most systems but only do it half-assed not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it. then there's gameinformer. there are many things that set gameinformer apart from many other gaming magazines: 1) they have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play. if the game sucks they say so; if it's an awesome game they'll tell you about it. 2) matt helgeson (senior gaming editor) and the other editors actually inform you about the game's most necessary attributes: its esrb rating (e to m) their rating for the game (from 1 to 10) and a brief introduction to the game's faults and successes. best of all however they include screenshots from the game- and most screenshots rock. these are just some of the reasons that gameinformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market. i have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only and i hope my review has explained why.

" overall this is the best gaming magazine i have read. it covers all consoles gives sensible (and funny) reviews and previews the hottest upcomming games. most games are reviewed by two people adding to the accuracy of the score. it has a rating of 1-10 10 being the best a rating which precious few games recieve. the previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games. some of them are one page long some ten. they all include pictures and most have an estimated release date. also there is a section on news in the game industry. ususlly near the beginning of the magazine they include news on developers consoles and the big names in the industry. all in all this is a great magazine and well worth your money because each issue is well over 100 pages ",positive
" i've been a p&w subscriber and reader (even when not a subscriber) for years. i've also tried various other writers' magazines such as the writer and writer's digest. the latter two were fine when i was just beginning to dip into the freelance market just beginning to look at publishers for first manuscripts but when i gained more experience i soon realized those just didn't make the cut anymore. the articles were too often repetitive and geared towards such elementary basics that i was no longer gaining new insights. p&w was the next step up. p&w provides advice inspiration informative interviews current resources for the more experienced and discriminating writer. the bimonthly issues include articles detailed listings of markets contests grants and helpful relevant ads. for the price this is the best magazine available today for the writer who has a portfolio already underway and keeping an ear to the ground for more staying up to date with what's rumbling in the literary world. with its up-to-date information i've been able to leave the others aside including that old bible writer's market which was unfortunately obsolete the moment it was off the presses. highly recommended for the writer wanting more. ",positive
" i'll let others argue whether or not the quality of the magazine has subsided over the years. i for one still get something out of the writing. can't do without my monthly dose of harper's and the atlantic. what i would like to point out is that why would you buy here when the subscriptions cost less on a.m.'s own website ",positive
" i used to read the online content for this magazine (i still check out the blog) but i have to say that there is even more content in the magazine than there is online and it's really worth subscribing. the articles are well written and usually change my mind on issues i may not have realized i had a mind to change on. i would recommend this magazine to anyone ",positive
" there are not many magazines specializing in political commentary that are really any good these days. so many of them are geared toward a political party instead of concentrating on the issues that are most important. reason magazine is the exception and with its motto that a free mind implies a free market and vice versa it has proven to be a publication that one can count on for objective analysis under the umbrella of that motto. the authors who write for it definitely have their biases but they are attentive to these biases and usually anticipate and answer objections to the ideas on which they expound. many times this reviewer heard that the authors and editors of reason are socially liberal but fiscally conservative. this kind of description almost implies that their thinking is a mere hybrid of liberalism and conservatism. but this description is incorrect for the content of the articles in reason is a consequence of the general belief among its authors and editors that freedom and that means first freedom of the mind is a moral universal regardless of the place and context in which one finds oneself. the `social liberalism' of reason if one is to call it that manifests itself in the tolerance of ideas that one finds repugnant. the `fiscal conservatism' of reason manifests itself in the belief that freedom is to be not subject to an arbitrary and coercive government that has no qualms about using deception or actual force to collect taxes impose censorship or generally violate individual rights. there are always many fine articles written in reason on a diversity of topics. the advocacy of biotechnology is refreshing and reflects a common sense attitude that is very rare in political debate on this branch of technology. one will also find commentary on government waste propaganda torture and the war on drugs. in addition many book reviews are included on books that are relevant to the issues that the magazine wants to address. one can only hope that reason stays afloat and delivers many more insights in the years to come. the magazine is both a barometer of freedom of thought as well as its creation.

" i subscribed to details because i'm interested in the male psyche. i also like looking at the male celebrity pictures and the guy models on ads. its not the most politically correct article on the planet for one the last page is called gay or...? in which the writer tries to uncover if a certain type of person is gay or not and no conclusion is actually ever given so i suppose its for the reader to decide. its a very stereotypical part of the magazine but beyond that there are cool articles to read from male perspectives. i also enjoy reading the celebrity interviews in addition they include interviews with female celebrities. i don't agree with everything that is printed here but certain articles have made me think and i've actually gotten a lot out of it. it helps me understand guys and i do agree with certain opinions. the mag leans toward the liberal and is unabashed in its attitude to do so. i like it a lot it may not be for everyone and that's fine.

" jeff goldblum's character in the big chill said that he couldn't write an article longer than the average person could read during a er trip to the library (wink wink nudge nudge know what i mean?). the writers at details seems to have the same marching orders. in these hectic times maybe that's not so bad. the articles i have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized. i actually finished the entire magazine between pm mail delivery and breakfast the next day. the topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. and again they cover the topics in very few well-written pages. i do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age that could be tunnel-vision (grey hair i remember filmore east you get the picture?). my suggestion take a look. it's a magazine with an interesting voice and it may be for you.

" i've been a subscriber for over fifteen years and will probably continue to subscribe until the day i die. but at times i find national geographic frustrating. i have no interest in soccer nor do i want a huge fold-out map discussing the sport. aren't there more phenomenal things going on in the world today? also geographic does have its pet topics. how many articles must we read about pandas? a dozen? i like pandas believe me but surely there are other less cute animals to discuss. also i could do without lectures and pc environmental propaganda. the articles about oil-drilling in alaska was filled with a thinly veiled agenda which was preachy and annoying. yeah we get it you don't want alaska drilled. can we move on please? other articles are quite interesting. i enjoy the zip code discussion the old-fashioned pictures and articles about countries. i could do with fewer articles about underwater archaeology though and the articles filled with preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring. a friend of mine (a joe average type guy) said he stopped subscribing to geographic because the articles were depressing him. i tried to argue with him because i think the magazine is great- but i do kind of have to agree the topics of late are downbeat and aren't particularly uplifting. i do believe the magazine is getting a little 'out there' with its choice of topics too. i recommend this magazine for those interested in the environment and the world around them ",positive
" although the stories and interviews in the strand are well worth reading i think it is worth saying that there are not many stories per issue and at least in the case of john mortimer's rumpole stories they are taken from forthcoming books. that being said the strand is worth the four stars i've given it but i would describe it as a &quot;coffee-table&quot; magazine if such a category exists due to its glossy pages large size format and relatively low number of stories and interviews in content ",positive

" this is an excellent magazine. there are very few magazines that i choose to read cover to cover. this is one of the few. the photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right. they are gorgeous. the writing is clear and concise and interesting. the topics they write on include history travel historical objects animals places and so on. one monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers. each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that picture important. they tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed (if it is a person). this is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money. enjoy.

" fortune is a classic on the newsstand and is as vital and important today as ever. fortune generally caters to people with a managerial bent especially upper-level executives but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world the global and national economic climate and forward-looking technology and trend information. each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story like the enron trial or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year. i do enjoy the articles where they rank things but more than the rankings themselves i am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings; while i don't always agree with the magazine i do always find it good food for thought. the features are generally very polished and accurate and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a ceo as to a college business student. i particularly appreciate the interviews that fortune has with key players in the financial industry and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue. the magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like kiplinger's. nonetheless the investment advice and insight fortune offers should generally be held in high esteem. i also appreciate the coverage of key trends and in particular want to note that fortune has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in america: coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader. many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money; while there are several i would recommend fortune remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends and should be a part of everyone's business library ",positive
" of the big 3 (fortune forbes and businessweek) i like fortune the most. businessweek feels like it's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing. forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose---to report and analyze the business world. fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does ",positive

" i actually make the recipes in this magazine. the recipes are simple but interesting. the nutritional information is also great. this is my favorite cooking magazine by far ",positive
" as a subscriber to martha stewarts magazines i have to admit this has become my favorite simply because its concise and interesting to boot. love the week end dinner section as well as the recipe index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when i am looking for something quick to consider fixing but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine. some of the other regular features that i like and find helpful are the cooking for one section since as a widow i hate wasting food and know of many other singles who want to eat healthy but need some ideas. also like the wine basics section which has enlightened me on new wines that i now like trying. in season is a great section because it reminds the reader what is in season which makes shopping and cooking easier. the size of the magazine is nice because it slips easily into my pocket so i can recheck it while shopping to see what items i have highlighted to pick up. this is also a great magazine for couples singles of all ages which is refreshing since so many magazines are geared to upper middle class 2.5 children homes. and... the magazine seems to improve with each new issue ",positive
" i have been getting this magazine for a year now. i have a few new favorites i make on a regular basis. the pictures are pretty. the prep times have been accurate for my cooking speed. the ingredients are all easy to find in my local grocery store. there is detailed nutrition info available for the dieters. so if you are looking for some nice new things to make this is a great way to find them.

" despite its name this mag isn't just for brainy types. anybody who's interested in knowing more quirky fascinating things about the world around them -- presented in a highly readable humorous style -- will find 'mental_floss' a fun read. interested in the weird history of hackers? ever wanted to know how to grow your own organs or wrestle an alligator? all written by your smart funny friend from college -- or so the mag's super-accessible style will have you thinking. a definite recommend ",positive
" i've actually met people who have said i'm too old to learn new things. and younger folk who have said that's too much like being in class. if you're one of these people don't bother with mental floss magazine or with going to school any more or for that matter with continuing to be alive in the first place. living is learning and this magazine helps edify and entertain you while you're doing all that living and learning. most highly recommended. but if you like staying stupid you're probably not reading this. carry on then. p.s. to the person who complained that the editors correct their previous mistakes and clarify their obfuscations in each issue: you'd prefer the wide variety of publications and tv news shows which don't ever acknowledge human error? good luck with that ",positive
" not as deep as macworld but worth the subscription due to the alternative perspective on software and hardware. very fun to read with a unique style of writing. the reviews can rarely be spotty with lack of depth as the culprit in some cases. the majority though are on target. the best part of the magazine are the unique 3rd party hardware finds. overall a great addition and enjoyable read ",positive
" needed. it's just as informative as macworld but more fun too read. to me macworld is like reading a text book while mac addict is like learning the same information from a really funny professor. i especially like the do-it-yourself projects that macaddict walks you through each month. they range in difficulty from how to build your own mac os x icons to how to program your own video game in visual basic to how to void your warrantee by soldering crazy stuff to the motherboard. these guys are seasoned mac geeks and they aren't afraid to help you become one too. if you're a super sensitive person macaddict may rub you the wrong way. sometimes their editors make jokes that draw hate mail from the readers like when the polish editor in chief cracks polish jokes. i don't mind these silly things but some might. to me all of the jokes usually help their articles make a more concrete and lucid point. throughout the year macaddict has special issues devoted to topics like maintenance practical jokes digital media preventing disasters detailed os x guides etc. i find these invaluable. i'm the guy my friends ask for mac help not because i'm smarter than other people but because i've been reading this great magazine for 6 year ",positive
" let's face it ....... owning a mac is like owning a harley or an airstream. it's a cult!!! good fun. harmless as can be and it just makes you feel good everytime you sit down at your mac. having a magazine come every month with a bunch of foolishness about this very slick machine increases the joy way more than the magazine price. i read it from cover to cover and even believe some of it ",positive

" most of the beautiful gardens i see are in washington or oregon or back east somewhere. having lived in washington i do enjoy seeing some of the plants that i am missing here in colorado but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all can't live in the pacific northwest. i have a subscription to sunset so i guess that will have to suffice but i do wish bh&g would take that into consideration. otherwise i love this magazine. i used to get several magazines but this was always my favorite. it is chock full of ideas that we can really use. and i love the photography. what sets bh&g apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses. slippers on the floor newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too. they are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot. it helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable. i would say get this magazine right away. i would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing.

" actually it deserves 4.5 stars. this is a brit magazine that offers great articles that cover classic bands' tales as much as keeping you tuned in to the latest waves of musicians from americana to blues to brit pop. there's at least one excellent long article per issue which will tell you more about bands you thought you knew about than any magazine published in usa (check old issues for dylan's or pink floyd's for instance). if you are old enough to remember rolling stone when it concerned itself with musicians and other artists creating new boundaries for popular art rather than catering the current pathetic britneyspear-nightmaremachine ... you would enjoy mojo. tip: you can get any single issue at b&n borders or tower records for the same amount that way if you don't like it you won't have to mourn 100 bucks ",positive

" my initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge and full of ads. i also read vogue though and to be honest w has less ads in it. w convieniently avoids the snotty air of harper's bazaar and vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in cosmopolitan redbook and marie claire and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of instyle. this magazine has excellent layouts and from what i've read thus far excellent-and very different-stories. as a regular vogue reader i'm used to reading about older designers like coco chanel the versace and prada lines and reading about a small smattering of socialites like aerin lauder paris hilton jemma kidd victoria traina. what is different about w is that it profiles the new and the modern. an article in the september issue profiled kate spade and her new line. other articles talked almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites meanwhile talking about in an article aptly titled a bag called it the trend of statement purses and their proper place. w is also similar to vogue that in addition to the good layouts it has even better photography there are no photoshopped to death photos in here and if they are this student can't find them. what i like most about w is its sarcastic wit something that is lost in most magazines many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man worship teri hatcher or read dumbed down articles.

" first i received this subscription as a gift for the holidays and can say that it is the gift that just gives and gives and gives. this magazine has been a wonderful source of ideas for in the kitchen on the grill around the house in my garden in the state as well as all through the south for traveling. being a woman who moved from the detroit suburbs to florida so i could be with ailing family i was really a duck out of my elements. i had no idea of what was where within the state; what are good places to visit where are some of the great attractions outside of orlando the keys and the everglades and who does what where. in this magazine there are sections devoted just to florida (which i suspect they do for each state per subscription) -- what to plant when what festivals are going on what's hot and what's not - a whole derth of information devoted just to the state i live in. and that's not all... not only do i get to learn more about where i am today i can explore and learn about where i'd like to go tomorrow. one month it's welcome to alabama and all the wonderful gems it has to offer. another month i am poring over beautiful georgia. a different topic? seafood of the south. how would you like to learn about fantasic but yet unknown places for bargains and great finds? now - i am also an avid cook at home - and i cannot tell you how much i love to read through and try/improvise on all the de-lish recipes found each month closer to the back of the magazine. how many differnt ways have i learned to make potato salad alone is worth the cost of admission! i have learned so much more about grilling vegetable side dishes breakfast treats and savories from all over the south tempting lip-smacking desserts - and everything in between. i have always known the south was the jewel of the states when it came to cooking - but w.o.w! so much history and fun can be shared whether it be in the kitchen or on the grill. and it is a great compliment to what i learn from other books the food channel and beyond. it speaks to where i live what i can get down here and what the heck plantains are anyway :-) i love looking through many of the decorating ideas the travel tips and vignettes of different states or towns or themes. the only reason this magazine does not get a 5 from me is that it sometimes caters/addresses a crowd which can afford more than i can in the way of travel decorating etc. i am more simple down-to-earth folk and do not share much with decorating your summer cottage or what to do with that spare $ thousand plus dollars on a cruise or splurge excursion. sometimes and since they are not making this magazine specifically for me i am not going to be able to relate to everything i am not the crowd they are talking to. otherwise this magazine is a 10 in my book :-) well worth the money - but even more so - the anticipation of next month's explorations ",positive

" as an author i find oprah's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month. divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act. everyone deserves intimacy-emotional and physical. if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife her happiness will be more important to him than his own. setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be is the ultimate expression of love. dennis j. schleicher ",positive
" oprah is an inspiring role model for millions of people. i believe that her mission is well-known- to help people live their best possible lives. it's rare to find another person who so consistently sticks to their mission and really change lives talk show after talk show and magazine issue after magazine issue. if you want to make your life better live more passionately and meaningfully then the oprah magazine will definitely help you out. it contains many interesting inspiriting and balanced topics on a broad range of subjects written by excellent writers and contributors. i am glad that the magazine still contains many really readable and informative articles appropriate for every woman who wants to feel happy empowered informed and intelligent. i enjoy this magazine because it opens my mind to the world and celebrates life and womanhood. each issue has a theme such as love health home fitness etc. and will cause you to take a serious look at your life and see how you can further improve yourself. you will find interesting and up-to-date information about fashion movie stars book recommendations delicious recipes money relationships and friends. my favorite section is her quotes on bookmarks. oprah winfrey is an example of a modern smart and sensitive woman who consistently uses her talents and staff of editors to bring us the talk show and this wonderful magazine. i think that your greatest benefit will be to gradually realize and energize her main message-you should be the first priority in your life because if you are confused exhausted dissatisfied depressed then you will not be able to help anyone! the magazine covers all of these important areas and i am pleased to recommend it. following oprah's tradition to draw attention to books of great value i recently read and highly recommend to my male and female clients scientist ritz' bestseller scientifcally guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex because it truly delivers great value and results. i dare say that this magazine and book will dramatically change your life for better ",positive
" if oprah made a magazine and it wasn't that good i would still read it but luckily she writes a great magazine and it is called o. oprah helps starving kids eat and crippled kids walk and that is the kind of neat stuff she puts in her magazine. i have to hide my copies of miss whinfrey's magazine because my brother takes them and tears them up because does not know how great a magazine it is right fellow oprah's magaine readsers???!!! if you want to learn to be a millionairrre with pretty dogs and have lots of people come to chicago to see you you will learn how in this magazine ",positive

" the london review of books is without a doubt the best literary journal in the world: at the same time erudite entertaining and informative each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media. there was a time in my life when i couldn't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold british winter but i never thought to cancel my subscription to the lrob. highly recommended ",positive
" the london review of books is simply the best generalist journal on topics of literature the arts culture history politics philosophy published in the world today--it now beats the ny review of books in terms of giving you the full picture and leaves the tls back in the dust. if you want to get your bearings in the world of culture and politics this is must reading. denis jonnes washington d. c./kitakyushu japan ",positive

" i have been a subscriber for years and have grudgingly paid more and more every year for my subscription. still i have always loved pw and look forward to my weekly edition...although i do not always receive my magazine in a timely manner. whether because i live on the west coast or if it's just the mail i don't know. sometimes it arrives way into the following week sometimes closer to the beginning of the week. i still find the magazine valuable but have to say the following: for a magazine directed at the publishing trade i find it ludicrous that there are so many typos in the reviews as well as the text. who is doing the proof reading here? there is a new format that has updated the look but i miss the best seller lists being in the back of the magazine. now they're somewhat in the middle and one definitely can't just easily flip to them. also the q&a's with authors are so stupidly placed in issues which don't contain the review of the author's book who is being interviewed. instead there is a reference date to the issue said book was reviewed in. it's frustrating to read the q&a and then not be able to see the review of the author's book in the same issue. i guess the publisher thinks people keep the magazine at least 4 weeks or issues just lie around the house or office and pile up. i like the deals columm and hollywood reader column but my very favorite section is the author profile. i am curious tho about the age of some of the writers in this publication... i'd also like to know how the magazine and the editors decide what book should get a starred review. sometimes i'm astounded as to what gets starred. the website which you get full access to when you register as a subscriber to the magazine is easy to use. even before i receive my issue in the mail i can see the latest issue on line ",positive
" i have been a reader & fan of dog world since i had my first dogs in 1981. being an avid dog-lover since childhood i have always enjoyed the breeder ads & discovering breeds new to me. these days one of my favorite sections is the rare breeds. i thoroughly enjoy the bi-annual all breed special issue. although each issue does profile a breed of dog what i like better than dog fancy is that the profiles are more informative & in-depth. dog world also covers rare breeds in their profiles not just akc breeds. i would recommend dog world for dog professionals & avid dog-lovers involved in dog sports; and dog fancy for the more casual dog people ",positive
" having recieved both dogfancy and dogworld i prefer dogworld. i have found that dogfancy tends to focus more on purebreds and akc events than on the general everyday mutts of america and what the owner of one can do with them. as an owner of a shelter mutt i appreciate dogworld's emphasis on the world of dogs- their nutrition health/care exercise and varied news paragraphs. i especially like the column on agility training- it is as beneficial to agility persons as well as great advice for any other sport- flyball obedience herding/hunting trials etc. since all sports deal with pretty much the same mental and physical aspects. i also really enjoy the different sports they highlight in each issue. the only thing about dogworld that bothers me is its series articles. if you don't follow one series to completion you get confused and sometimes the series are more geared to the professional world (veternarians and trainers) than to the 'regular' folk. dogworld gives a much more rounded view of the world of dogs and what can be done with them than dogfancy which tends to focus on more of the breeding side of the world and akc ",positive
" i love to cook. i am not a professional by all means but i do enjoy the concept of preparing food. other than tv bon appetit is one of my main sources i refer to that inspires me to create my next meal. i have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now. i have to admit i don't necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that i read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas. some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue (i love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years) and thanksgiving. what i am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end. from my point of view a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make. i am blessed to live in a big city where i can find most of the ingredients but if i lived in a smaller city or town it probably would be difficult to find. these recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed. all in all i still enjoy reading bon appetit and being inspired by the magazine ",positive
" i have been reading the ny times book review for many many years. there rarely is a week when there is not some review of considerable interest to me. though i oppose its political bias which is left liberal i appreciate the solidity and respectful way in which most reviews are written. there is a sense that for the times books and culture in general have meaning and importance. the 'times ' tends to bet for its main articles on proven winners. a review in the times can make a person's name and many many are the writers whose books have arrived in the 'times' offices never to be given a real look at. the 'times ' articles and reviews are not the longest and the deepest but they do often provide pleasant reads and arouse real interest in the book in question. the ny times book review is still of first importance because the ny times is . i still try to skim through every week searching for the review or two that i really have to try to chew and digest.

" this is not the kind of magazine you read at least not cover to cover. this is for serious shopping or shopping ideas. feel a whole in your wardrobe? lucky can tell you what to put in it for a variety of price ranges. that is one of the reasons i really like this magazine it shows different price ranges of a style so you can decide how much you want to spend on the perfect look. it also gives great website types which is very helpful when your stuck out in the middle of the continent. the everyday girl advice on mixing and maxing is often lacking but the magazine makes up for it with pages of clothing shoes etc. devoted to shopping pick this up ",positive
" forget about shop etc... lucky is the best shopping mag by far. i got alot of coupons for full size products an samples inside of lucky magazine. i love me some free samples! i am from nyc and you have to know what's wearing and all so this mag let me know a whole lot about fashion makeup hair produts house wares etc ",positive
" i thought eh lucky magazine i don't really need this anymore... so i broke it off. (i am a college student so i'm a little bit poor. lol.) i was wrong. i love lucky. i know fashion and trends are kind of an air head market but i'm going to subscribe again because: a.) i am a design student and fashion and trends are chock full of design elements b.) i subscribe to newsweek and i watch the news all the time. it is depressing lucky is not. c.)after coming home from a long day of classes and work it's not so bad to want to read something with lots of pretty pictures is it? (the answer is no that is not bad.) lucky rocks. seriously. if you want something that's fun to read and fun to look at it's great. i don't recommend it for people who are in deep credit card debt becasue they just had to have the latest designer handbag becuase this will get you into trouble. for everyone else who just wants to look hip... or just plain sytled. lucky is a great magazine ",positive
" even if this magazine is a mag-a-log what would we do without it? september issue rocks with eva mendes on the cover and some juicy fall finds inside. the biggest news? lucky has found a way to shop with your cell while stuck in traffic. it's about time technology got up with our lifestyle ",positive
" this magazine single-handedly taught me how to dress with style- and believe me- that's no small feat. i love how lucky shows how to put pieces together to look fabulous without mindlessly following the crowd. if that's all i had interest in then i could've simply bought the lucky shopping guide book. but their reviews of up and coming clothing and jewelry designers hair makeup home decor and the how i'm wired sections keep me coming back to the magazine. plus the lucky breaks are awesome. my only complaint is the average price of their featured raved-about items. what lucky is for me is a fantastic template for fashion and style that i can use to find similar items at cheaper prices in stores like h&m target etc. it's so worth the $12/year and i look anxiously at the beginning of each month for its arrival in my mailbox ",positive
" i actually really love this magazine. the articles are down to earth and helpful...not cheesy and shallow like those found in cosmo. the editorial staff of lucky seems to really relate to real women and aren't bitchy and pretentious like other women's magazines ",positive
" i say almost due to the fact that aperture gives them a good run for the money. you know those photography magazines with about 10 pages of pictures and articles and the rest is advertising? this is not it! if you enjoy a magazine that delivers informative photographing techniques get this one! if you are interested in seeing the work of other photographer's get this magazine! if you want a hot collectible get this magazine!!! yes there are ads in here but not a ton of them. for you guys (and girls) out there who love to see the occasional beautiful star photographed get this magazine. one of the aspects of this magazine that i like is the fact that the photo layouts are sometimes full page unlike some magazines where you have to get out a magnifying glass to view the photos. and this one is a hot collectible though the french version of it is an even hotter collectible. whether it's nature special effects or provocative photography this one is a superb magazine. in short this one is a must get for the photography fan ",positive

" i subscribe to inc.. although i am not a business owner yet i find the articles to be informative and the magazine a useful resource. as an accomplished song writer and aspiring song seller the article on (...)-may 2005- made me aware of a resource that i did know was available. check that one out. with joe mansueto ceo of morningstar and self-confessed fan of inc. acquiring the magazine i can only imagine the great things ahead. the full-page n.y. times ad reinforces mansueto's commitment to growing the brand. can't wait for future issues ",positive
" inc. magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity. with inc. you get timely advice on taxes marketing financing and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day. probably the strongest point of inc. is the way it presents important information to readers. the authors of this magazine get directly to the point. they don't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact. even when the news is bad like with regulations taxation etc. inc. lets you have it in a direct manner. this is good because i get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts. inc. writers are direct and i respect them for that. if there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine i can think of only two: the lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that while nice to read about present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners. inc. is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth. this is fine but i would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground. and every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich. again this is ok but i would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well- off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic. still inc. is a very good publication for small business owners. it provides some good timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns. the price to subscribe is low too making inc. magazine a must for owners of small growing companies.

" i can give this great music magazine no greater praise than to say that pretty much all of my favorite new bands in the last couple of years have been discovered through under the radar. on top of that they also write great articles on some of my pre-existing favorite bands. under the radar generally has much better writing than some of the other indie music mags out there (devil in the woods rockpile big takeover etc.) and fits my musical tastes perfectly ",positive
" under the radar and filter are the only music magazines i come near. i hear mojo is just as informative renovative and enjoyable but i'm a little too close-minded to care about other genres i... don't care much about. fans of rock/pop/what the kids are calling indie/alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/!!!! take a gander at this. and the covers are slick and durable. they don't look out of place sitting on a coffee table ",positive
" so often when looking through magazines i haven't found quite what i was looking for in the christian literature. i like the approach christianity today takes. it has articles that are broad and not focused on a specific demonination. i believe the magazine has a slight evangelical bent to it. i do like the variety of articles and coverage of current events. i would recommend this magazine for those who want to become a little more informed of christianity in the modern world ",positive
" this is a decent magazine and it's good to support an unabashed christian magazine. but if sojourners ~sometimes~ errors to the left- christianity ~often/ persistently~ errors to the the right. i subscribe to both and if i find myself agreeing with the editors of one magazine too long i dig back deeper into the bible and then come out in the right place. contributor yancey is an inspiration and a true christian voice; while colson is deluded by the high places of power and is a stain on an otherwise reasoned approach of ct ",positive

" a woman that is passionate about beautiful things writes this review. i am an avid do-it-yourselfer and love to do things around the house. this magazine has been one of my favorites for years. i look forward to each new issue and the decorating ideas that it will provide. this magazine concentrates on upscale decorating architecture and landscapes. many of the articles feature european country looks. the photographs in this magazine are absolutely beautiful. the july / august 2006 edition contained the following: 1. venetian villa (adrienne vittadini in sarasota florida) 2. nantucket renewal (enlarging a classic cottage) 3. blooming intensity (saturated with color) 4. coastal hues (seaside radiance captured) 5. british accent (this side of the pond) 6. the art of dining 7. the view from veranda (summer place) 8. tableaux (staged elegance) 9. personal luxury (cool coral) 10. on exhibit (jungles in paris) 11. trade secrets (summertime: fabrics rugs lighting) 12. passions (birds of paradise: home aviary design) 13. showcase (summer seating: for pool and porch) 14. verdant paths (annevoie: belgium's water garden) 15. the last word (vanity flair: adrienne vittadini sketchbook) there are many photographs of this magazine of both house interiors and exteriors that i find to be very inspirational from a decorating perspective. if you are looking for either painting or decorating ideas this magazine has much to offer. i have replicated some of the interiors in my own home. the exterior photographs of this magazine are always very appealing. i have been slowing changing the landscaping on my property to reflect a more italian way of life. i think you will be inspired to create an alfresco dining space after you have seen some of the beautiful landscape photographs. the merchants that advertise in this magazine are fabulous. i have purchased many items from them and have always been happy with my purchases. i highly recommend this magazine to anyone that loves interior design or just likes nice things. this magazine is top notch all the way.

" this magazine is so packed full of goodies that you may need something with wheels to carry it out. the paper alone is worth the price. there are a lot of good books on decorating. and more on picture of foreign places. this one however is of items that you will want and maybe even afford one or two if you have not spent all your discretionary money on books and book cases. every library should have a fire place and this magazine often shows some of the best surrounds. the furniture and art work is well within the norm but just beyond the ordinary. even if you do not take advantage of the ads and articles to spruce up your abode you can sit back and dream of being there.

" i am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that i prepare for my family. the beauty of gourmet is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture. i also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods and on quick methods and dishes. i have read gourmet off and on for at least 20 years. the magazine has changed somewhat during that time. the focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine. the features of the june 2006 edition are as follows: tiki time: a collection of polynesian food and drink we are family: recipes for a summer party a greece less traveled: northwestern greece travel and recipes in the section seasonal kitchen there is a very well done article on salads. the roasted vegetable panzanella is fantastic. in the gourmet everyday section i always enjoy the three regular articles: quick kitchen (30 minutes meals) five ingredients and 10 minute mains. these are always tasty and usually all quick. if you are a foodie and/or you want to be this magazine is a nice starting point. i would suggest that you pick up a couple of issues on the newsstand to confirm that this magazine is for you before subscribing. i highly recommend this magazine for budding home chefs.

" the new york review of books is published 20 times a year biweekly except in january july august and september. it is a respected publication which is devoted mostly to reviews of current books and an occasional movie. it also contains articles of social or political interest. the letters section is usually brief with little waste. contributors to a recent edition included mark danner sister helen prejean and daniel mendelsohn. reviews covered such diverse items as a collection of short stories by graham greene and two books about the actress anna may wong in addition to alexander a film directed by oliver stone. the new york review of books consistently offers provocative writing in a highly readable style. it definitely deserves its reputation for excellence ",positive
" nyrb features long in-depth articles about recent books and events. the reviews frequently take the book under discussion as a starting point for a wide-ranging essay which then becomes a work in its own right. indeed i've seen articles in nyrb referred to in academic papers. don't fear that nyrb will bore you however. i've often found a nyrb article to be a great introduction to an area of thought or literature previously unknown to me. the only negative is a rather tedious michael-mooreish political stance. i have no objection to seeing bush bashed but wish that nyrb could do so in a more creative and less repetitive manner. maybe once in a while we could hear from someone who actually likes the man? nevertheless i find nyrb an indispensable periodical. i find it a great complement to the economist which features a more pro-business and pro-free trade economic stance and wider but less deep coverage of the world ",positive

" this magazine would be a delightful reading experience for a wide audience. it appeals the *most* to busy young adults who are looking for quick healthy easy-to-make delicious meals which they just *might* want to spice up with an occasional adventurous new taste in wine recommendations. there is a wonderful column on new flavors. in the june 2004 issue it is lemongrass. in the july issue it is miso. there are fine recommendations for new restaurants in exotic locales such as bermuda or sao paolo brazil. also included are foods for special holidays such as in june for father's day. naturally grilling is the haute cuisine on this auspicious day. the recipes for salmon nicoise sandwiches and tuscan baby back ribs are mouth-watering ... the fast food section is loaded with tasty healthful salads such as spicy chicken avacado and mango salad and turkey and green bean stir-fry with peanuts. some grilling suggestions include tandoori pork with gingered mango salad and korean-style chicken wraps. needless to say all the food is tempting and the recipes are not too difficult to accomplish provided one is already familiar with cooking techniques. overall the emphasis on this magazine is *not* on wine but instead on food. for a change of pace the june issue has a very fine article on vodka. in the july 2004 issue there is a superb article by robert parker called australian wine guide. the regular wine column covers german reisling by richard nailey. most impressively the july issue introduces the reader to america's best new chefs of 2004. of course each selects a recipe to share. this magazine is loaded with unique articles for the adventurous cook and aspiring gourmand. highly recommended. erika borsos (erikab93 ",positive

" the magazine is based on the work of an actual test kitchen outside of boston ma. it is thorough and focused and right on. i have also found it to be very impressive because it is printed on recycled paper and it isn't your typical publication with glossy paper and lots of photos. in fact pictures that are found within its pages are drawn by staff members thus illustrated. you'd be surprised at how great it is. it leaves you with a feeling of nostalgia with every delivery. it is also written with great clarity. plus you'll find literal gifts to yourself in every issue atypical of most others. there are of course terrific recipes. then you'll find equipment ratings taste tests and comparisons suggestions for supplies herbs and spices specialty foods tips and techniques shortcuts etc. one of my most favorite areas is the editorial from the publisher in the beginning of each issue. i love his down to earth somewhat quirky style of writing as it is always interesting and always intelligent. if you go to their website name of magazine you'll find good deals on subscriptions and they will send you a free issue. there is something for everyone here....the novice cook and the accomplished chef. highly recommended.

" quite frankly this is the only cooking magazine i have ever subscribed to that i actually have looked forward to using and to receiving every two months. i like it so much i am writing my first amazon review! the format of the magazine makes it easy to follow the recipes - they are always printed on two pages across from each other - and unlike some of the other posters i prefer the black and white format so that the paper is thicker and doesn't tear easily. having tear away ads (for their own products) on the outside of the magazine means that the usable portion doesn't take up much space on my shelf. the recipes are easy to follow and usually clear. when they include specialized ingredients there is usually also a substitution listed. their product reviews are terrific - i wish i hadn't wasted so many dinners on bad whole wheat pasta. my only gripe as someone who does not have a dishwasher is the great number of bowls and kitchen tools the recipes require. i have made at least half the recipes from the magazines many several times which is no small feat for a flexitarian who never has meat as a main dish.

" vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous. i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90:10. it still has wonderful fashion tips but the ads are becoming burdonsome. in style has replaced vogue as my #1 fashion mag but i'll always be a vogue reader ",positive

" interesting may 05 issue. when i saw the cover i sighed and with a somewhat sinking heart picked it up wondering who now had declared war on america. oh! why it's only the christians now. this was a great issue. i had not read one in quite awhile and forgotten how funny and sad they could be. the harper's index page is full of eyebrow lifting information. readings was great. the articles on the market economy and the religious right was a jaw dropper. i had to get up and look under the table to find where mine had fallen and rolled. most everyone knows this information in some depth and degree but . . . these articles were different. like some other books and articles i have read they are couched with the attitude of wake up please. throw some water on your face look around and wake up hurry before it's too late. once you get through the large amount of heartbreaking information contained (please tell me that america did not `sell' cornmeal that we knew was going to starving people etc. etc. etc.) you are deposited at karbola for an account of the sunni versus shia and then on to katmandu and the monarchy and maoists. the final article is on tango dancers and somewhat of a relief. after reading this you might want to go home and just pull the covers over your head. don't. waddle around to another section and fiind a magazine called what is enlightenment? the april/may issue has a equally jaw dropping set of articles on the market economy. it's the perfect follow up to the harper's. harper's is a wake up call if you've slept late. wie is the what can we roll up our sleeves and do about it. the people they interviewed are not pollyannas. several are quoted as saying that they really think there may be nothing left to do but totally dismantle the old system but they are willing to put that aside and focus on fixing instead of destroying and trying their hardest to make the new ideas work. they have some incredible contributers to the articles and to the new system they are trying to impliment. short articles from dadi janki and joseph p. milton are included. the article about tex gunning - president of unilever bestfoods asia and his new direction for his company is wonderful. these are people who are trying to shift the whole attitude of companies. it's not the current spate of altrustic activity that is geared more toward upping sales with profit as the end result but a real shift to business conducted with the end result as a healthy sustainable world. the end result would benefit humanity first the business second and the shareholders third. novel concept eh? they make you believe that it just may work. they are however very up front about the timeline and how many people have to be shifted - quickly - in order for it to work. read them both - it's worth the time and i think that they both have something very important to say.

" in the several years since my retirement i have come to wait by my trusty old rusted metal mailbox around the third or fourth of every month waiting for my monthly issue of two magazines the atlantic monthly and harpers. each in iuts own way is likely the best amalgams of intellectual articles on a variety of subjects one can find in contemporary america and each features a stable of highly regarded writers and authors. for good reason; from subjects as arcane as the supposed imminent fall of the soviet union based on demographic and economic analysis in the mid-1980s to the recent synopsis of former spy robert baer regarding the evils of dealing with the highly corrupted saudi regime the magazine consistently offers an erudite informative and provocative look at aspects of contemporary reality one cannot find elsewhere. needless to say i really enjoy reading harpers especially under the guidance of editor lewis lapham and its articles often lead me on amazon searches for tomes by the talented authors which in the case of said author robert baer or perpetually sagacious satirist p.j. o'rourke or a whole raft of noteable others. all of them lead to some worthwhile reading experiences indeed. it avoids the trendy so we are spared the suffering through the latest and greatest mass experiences in favor of intellectual roads less traveled being grassy and rather wont of wear makes for better and more satisfying traveling whether trudging through the snow with my wintertime dunham tyroleans or padding down grassy fields in my summertime birkenstocks. just keep on trucking! enjoy!

" my kids love highlights! it's applicable to both of their age ranges (6 and 9) and is a valuable investment for any parent. i don't know what i would do without this magazine; it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car. not to mention it's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months.

" i've been reading glamour for the past three years and it has been a great magazine all around. glamour covers topics on health career finances sex relationships style etc. of all the magazines on the newsstands this one is the most intelligent and savvy for women in their 20s and 30s. yes there are too many ads like in most magazines but that's how the media survives they get their salary mostly from ads. i usually don't mind because i feel that its such a great magazine that the ads are worth putting up with. i have felt that at times cosmopolitan is a little too focused on sex and please your man articles. glamour seems to have found a nice balance and i don't feel that it dumbs down my intelligence at all. i do wish that they would expand beyond the typical articles. i wish that they would include more sections on culture travel and technology. men's magazines include articles on gadgets and tech and as a woman i enjoy gadgets as well. its not just a guy thing. its not a perfect magazine some issues are better than others but i feel that at this time glamour is the best magazine for women right now.

" if i could only subscribe to one magazine i'd pick marie claire in a heart beat. it offers everything other women magazine have including love life diet beauty fashion and celebrity. in addition marie claire focuses on issues larger than the domestic us. being an educated young woman i am interested in real life issues that other magazines tend to ignore. not only does marie claire have the guts to discuss issues that are hard to read at times (domestic abuse prostitution in asia weight discrimination etc.) but they actually tell you how you can help. by listing numerous websites and phone numbers along with their article it allows me to research the topic further and makes taking action just that much easier. the cover of marie claire may not look any different than any other women magazine but open it up and i guarantee you will see a difference ",positive

" the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends. the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic. it is one of two magazines i subscribe to (the other being the new yorker.) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you. it is not gourmet or martha stewart (not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice ",positive

" i unfortunately didn't renew my subscription to the week years ago due to constant travel and never being around to read it. i have missed it deeplyt in that time. having just gotten the first issue of my new subscription it lives up to all of my memories. a mixture of news items on all kinds of issues from all sorts of publications and many points of view is refreshing and informative. i find out about important and interesting things about which most never hear. i cannot say enough good things about the week ",positive
" remember when the dawn of 24/7 cable news networks seemed to be a godsend? now we know that that led to 24/7 garbage (breaking news now means a peek at the food menu served to the self-confessed and deluded killer of jonbenet ramsay the elevation of trivia to news status to fill time on a slow news day the absence of any sort of perspective or background the application of insane levels of urgency to minor health scares endless celebrity gossip etc.). i had enough of this nonsense. all i wanted was a brief summary of what was important with some context thrown in. all the truly significant news can be relayed in a brief period of time; the rest is junk meant to fill in the time between commercials. more time spent on news does not mean being better informed because 24/7 news is simply obsession with the same few stories repeated ad nauseum. i tried the christian science monitor. they have excellent standards but it is expensive to get every day. i then tried this publication. it met my needs. you get a complete summary of everything that was important in the previous week's news with a minimum amount of fluff. celebrities are lucky to get a paragraph if anything in the entire issue. you come away from this magazine (easily read in an hour) with a great overview of all that mattered in the previous week. international and world stories get much more coverage than what you see on cnn fox or your local paper. there doesn't seem to be any bias that i could detect. get this if you want to decrease your time spent on news but still be well informed. move over you stodgy time and newsweek magazines ",positive

" should you try out the hotel hot tub while on vacation or try the pool instead? this magazine has excellent advice for everything from travel concerns to fitness and beauty advice. recipes for natural salt scrubs with buttermilk mingle with the hottest advice on commercial beauty products. do the new stick-on manicures work? what is the newest information on cancer prevention? dr. andrew weil has a 5-minute section with holistic-health advice where he explains why wild alaskan salmon and blueberries will keep skin youthful. is the air in your home as clean as it could be? fun product pages offer seasonal comforts. for summer you may find yourself looking up beach blankets and fans. special sections show you how to lose weight even when on vacation. interesting advice on how to beat stress and why you should find ways to increase the release of oxytocin. the only thing in the magazine of concern seems to be the advice section which i read but take some of her advice with a big pinch of salt. if someone thinks they are suffering from an addiction they probably are. i'm at times rather surprised by her answers that seem to lean towards a casual approach to serious life-changing situations although she seems to give women great advice about health issues when it comes to making them feel better about breast cancer or work situations. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" i picked up a copy of health at my local grocery store mostly out of curiosity. i found myself enjoying it enough so that i will be ordering a subscription. here's why: 1.it encompasses every facet of health not just diet or exercise. as one reviewer noted it is broken down into categories: looks living moving feeling and flavor (it was just redone). the articles in each seem to be well-written and are enjoyable. i particularly enjoy the feeling and living sections as they are something that is rarely found in other magazines. 2. unlike many other magazines i found myself marking or wanting to mark so many pages to keep or check out further that in ended up being a good part of the magazine. i like most others enjoy getting the most for my money. while everyone has a different idea of what constitutes a good magazine this one will soon be a regular fixture in our house ",positive

" i was a loyal reader for many years and i've always been very impressed by their insightful deep investigations into various scandals and national political events. they _always_ knew more than the newspapers. they've been just excellent very well-written and i always felt like they could back up their opinions and their open and earnest political biases right to the 6th level of abstraction so to speak. their pursuit of the objective truth whether their target has been bush or the dnc has earned my respect. the new republic kept investigating and muckracking while over the last decade major news institutions have one by one become purveyors of infotainment and pre-digested pablum. my sense is that with media consolidation and various new press liability laws news sources have become air-tight and we've been getting our news from company pr flacks and lobbyist firms with agendas. in this environment the real investigative work becomes like gold. middle-brow types read time but the writers at time and others who want real knowledge and context on what is happening on the ground all read the new republic. the magazine has been vastly more influential than it's 100k+ circulation #'s would imply. but..the new republic was _for_ the war in iraq despite their natural antipathy towards bush which i share. i haven't read them lately - i'm sure they're appalled at how things have gone over there. the magazine has never been a cluster of soft peaceniks usually associated with the left but here i feel like they've let loose their inner hawks & given bush the benefit of the doubt (always the _wrong_ decision).. so what does that make them..quasi-neocons? utopians? dupes? they're often much too closely focused on israel and this also may have clouded their thinking ..along with colin powell's great song-and-dance at the u.n. last year. i felt i needed to try something new. lately i've been reading the new yorker & reason (it's right-of-center doppelganger) & some other magazines but i still think the new republic is an excellent source of news and very worthwhile. definately - you should buy an issue on the news stand & try it out ",positive
" though i oftentimes disagree with some of the articles written by the new republic i cannot help but keep coming back to this magazine when trying to gain better insight into current affairs. if for anything else the quality of the writing in this magazine is amazing and its reporters obviously conduct painstaking research in writing every nuianced article. the group that writes for tnr are obviously some of the best journalistic writers around and its critique on intellecual matters and popular culture are itself enough reason to purchase a subscription to this magazine (if you don't like its politics). all in all this is a fine magazine ",positive
" bridal guide is a lengthy magazine designed to appeal to brides in waiting and to those women who see marriage on the horizon. this magazine is devoted to bridal fashion and to other things that are involved in making the day special and memorable. besides the fashion one can read about wedding planning honeymoon ideas photography and other wedding- related things. when you read a copy of bridal guide what stands out more than anything are the photos. this is the main reason people read this magazine in the first place: to look at wedding attire and compare different styles. models wearing wedding gowns are abundant in this publication and some of the bridal gowns they adorn are quite stunning. to help future brides make a possible purchase it is common to find a phone number and/or a web site with the majority of the photos. bridal attire is the main focus of this magazine but there are also some pictures of grooms and of other wedding party members with models displaying other fashions for sale once again complete with phone number and web page. the part of this magazine that focuses its attention on honeymoons and travel is probably my favorite part of the issue. what i like is the fact that this is one part of the magazine that can appeal/apply to anyone regardless of marital status. these honeymoon tips and destination information provide some good reading material for the bride to be or anyone else who happens to read the magazine. bridal guide is a very lengthy publication with each issue containing around 500 pages! this is more than double the length of most other magazines and it can make the issue seem a little overwhelming at times. also this magazine is saturated with ads. since the majority of the gown- clad models are in effect advertisements for a specific fashion brand one can expect to find ads covering the vast majority of this magazine's pages. this could be annoying to some but one must bear in mind that the magazine's focus is wedding planning so excessive advertising is expected. for young brides- to- be or bridal wannabes this is a handy magazine to have around. it's very long but it contains lots of fashion and wedding planning ideas to make the big day one to remember forever.

" i'm usually not one for taking a chance on new magazines (especially if they've been shoved down the public's throats or oprah winfrey endorses it) but this is one instance where oprah gets major-league credit for putting her faith and money in rachael ray. i was impressed with the magazine's layout - not too elementary nor too complicated - and the recipes contained within are delicious and easy to prepare (and you won't go searching every speciality shop in the country for the ingredients either). i also like how rachael let readers in on her italian wedding and african safari honeymoon. unlike other celebrities she didn't let us know too much information (thank you!) and i'm sure her recommendations of trattorias cafes and hotels in tuscany are worth the time and easy on the budget. just because she doesn't have initials besides her name and a culinary degree (she's not the only one on the food network lacking this!) rachael spent her whole life in restaurants and with food and she learned the same tricks of the trade that the fusion chefs on the network know. this is definitely worth a look at and i'm seriously considering ordering a subscription.

" if i had to pick just one women's magazine to subscribe to good housekeeping would be the one. it has many of the same articles that all women's magazines have: articles on health fitness finance relationships diet beauty and fashion. but good housekeeping goes beyond the surface in these articles for example their fashion articles don't focus just on high-priced clothing instead they show outfits that look like their expensive counterparts that readers can buy for just a fraction of the cost. there are also advice columnists on things like household hints etiquette and relationships. each issue also has a short story. there's also the seemingly obligatory celebrity on the cover and interview inside each issue. what i like about good housekeeping are the in-depth articles. most magazines today publish articles that are only a page or so long but many articles in good housekeeping are several pages long. the articles are often about ordinary people making a difference in the world. there are usually cautionary articles for parents with young children and/or teenagers that can be frightening (a recent article was about a sexually abusive male babysitter) but very useful. as with many magazines good housekeeping also has an on-line counterpart where readers can post messages about current issues as well as enter contests. well worth subscribing to.

" good housekeeping is a wholesome clean serious magazine. various topics that may be found in an issue - how to raise children household tips financial help or marriage advice - suggest that the magazine is geared towards the middle-aged to the older woman. i'm married and only in my 20s but i still get so much out of reading the articles and advice anyway. i absolutely love this magazine! i was looking for a magazine with good long articles to read and i found this great one. they even re-designed the look and it's excellent. everything is more organized clearly separated into their respective sections and each page is clearly marked with the section header so i'll always know which section i'm on. i particularly enjoy the articles about real-life triumphs and tragedies talk to me by joy behar about relationship advice and peggy post's etiquette dilemmas ",positive

" the wall street journal is nothing less than america's true newspaper of record a window on the world of business finance international affairs and all the delicious little nuggets of news that would otherwise slip through the cracks. i am a media carnivore: i am news-addicted. i get my news in hourly massive slabs: from cnbc from cnn from the internet---and best of all in the brain-shatteringly early hours of the morning in the form of my daily wall street journal (kudos goes as well to my unfailingly faithful early-rising journal deliveryman). with that high praise i also must dispatch a warning to the curious: if you subscribe to the journal---and if you want to be informed and ahead of the game then you must!---you'll discover possibly for the first time intense agonies of guilt. the journal is every single day chock full of so many juicy delicious insanely informative amazingly well-written positively balanced nuggets of journalism on finance politics economics technology market trends literary explosions---so much in fact that it's an embarrassment of riches. if you're busy---and who isn't?---then you simply won't have time to read everything. like caesar's roman gaul the wall street journal is also divided into three parts: the front page marketplace and money & investing. page one is my beachhead in the morning: i scan the middle two columns for the financial and geopolitical earth movers---and if i have the time i can dig into the paper for all the gory details. the news here is uniformly objective: opinion is cut out the wounds cauterized and the unbiased opinion itself served up piping hot on the journal's editorial page. marketplace deals with macro and micro business trends and is always engagingly written. sometimes the supplement personal journal accompies the fleet out; more often than not there's another tasty little section dealing with mutual funds technology trends industry strategies and quite a bit more. it's a veritable treasure-house of knowledge and since gordon gekko was right---the most valuable commodity in the world is information---the wall street journal serves as purveyor of that most critical that most precious commodity. and i might add serves it up with spice brains guts and panache. oh and money & investing is a fly-by of all the major financial trends of the day: m&a economics currency commodities oil making investors shake and quake big stock movers. all good stuff. finally---and i'm biased be warned---the editorial page is the best on the planet and i always scour it at lunch---always. if you want to be informed---if you want to be light years ahead of your arch-rival that nasty vp of finance hastings down the hall which naturally you do---you should at the very least read the editorial page. it is incisive delicious never boring brimming with opinion and intelligence. yum. the journal is with me in the nosebleed hours of the early morning right beside my boiled eggs and toast and steaming cup(s) of coffee. and it's with me in the evening when i actually get to dip into it at leisure with my cigar and scotch. so subscribe to it i say: the wall street journal is an important glorious massively influential american institution. it's your window on the world of affairs. it's what the movers and shakers of the british empire might have read had the empire survived into the 21st century: and yes you have the news of the world at your fingertips hauled back from the journal's far-flung outposts across the globe: from hong kong london kuala lumphur. sincere kudos to the journal's officer corps: karen elliott house the publisher; paul steiger managing editor; and paul gigot editorial page editor---and the brilliant dedicated blindingly talented team of reporters that work with them. bravo! for a decade now not a morning has dawned without my journal: it is my polestar and compass. it makes me richer which makes me happier. it is a tasty read. stop gawking and subscribe.

" this past summer i picked up two issues of this magazine and they sat on my shelf for a few months before i finally got around to reading them. i was impressed. the quality of this magazine is higher than any other photographic magazine i've seen. the image quality the paper all top notch. this is a fine arts magazine and doesn't (at least from what i saw) spend time with articles about the technical side of the art. rather it focuses on individual artists and shows samples of their work. there are more great photographs in here than in any other photo magazine i've read. i intend on subscribing.

" if you like cars then car and driver is the magazine for you.the writers are the best and the articles are informitive ",positive
" car and driver is the multi-purpose auto magazine. it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world and magazines like motor trend which focus on the more practical. the magazine is always a fun intereseting read and keeps you up to date on teh auto world. i must however say that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend and it doesn't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track (and definitely falls short of road and track's superb photography.) ",positive
" car and driver is definitely the best automotive magazine in the world. this magazine has something for everybody whether your a person just looking for a new car or a serious car enthusiast. i have been a car and driver sucscriber for 6 years now and i regularly purchase the other three popular monthly car magazines (motor trend road & track and automobile). by far car and driver is the best of the four testing more automobiles per issue (about least twice as many as road & track per year) conducting larger comparison tests and generally being the most enjoyable. car and driver is also greater fun to read as the editors are very prone to jokes and wisecracks and not afraid to write how they really feel about a car no matter how good or bad it is. the road tests are comprehensive with a long list of tests performed for every vehicle and the good points and bad points listed along with a sentence summary of the vehicle. all the reviews are unbiased (mostly) and all vehicles are compared to similar cars in the same class. the bottom line: if you want a magazine that tests more motor vehicles than any other american car magazine prints accurate specifications and performance tests results on each one and includes autosport articles and up to date auto news yet you don't want to fall asleep reading it car and drvier is the magazine for you.

" this is a light and colorful newspaper. i remember when it first came out .the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole. it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country. the reporting itself is clear and very readable. the paper lacks weight and depth. it has a lot of variety in its features and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable. it's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting. and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers.

" one of the better weekly magazines that covers world affairs from what's on the news around the world to some pretty obscure things like imelda marcos' shoes to life in china a society not at ease with the globalisation of the world. time did a really good article on how google has allowed itself to be sensored in the name of finance makes you realise that human rights don't exsist when the dollar signs are being totted up! the uk edition pretty much follows the usa edition it's an easy read and what's good is that every now and again time puts out a special edition which often follows a theme the last one was on christopher columbus. worth getting a subscription also you can do what i do when you've read a copy give it to your local dentist or doctor for their waiting room ",positive

" i have subscriptions to a few magazines and i have to say seventeen is the one i'm always looking forward to. this magazine has a little bit of everything- fashion and make-up tips how to be healthy (not just stick thin!) tips for school fun (not very useful but fun) stuff on guys and love teen stories and important information to be aware of. it's fun but also informing. the models are normal girls and this mag shows things that not only a size 0 or 2 girl can wear but also clothing that can be worn by a girl who's size 4 8 or 16. many styles from girly to goth are shown not just one. the clothing and accessories are also affordable and can be found at stores in your nearby mall. seventeen isn't all fashion. it's really all about embracing who you are and making the most of life. it's about feeling good about yourself and loving yourself for who you are and not what you aren't. i've used some of the tips on health skin care feeling good and make-up and you know what? they do work and are actually helpful (***gasp***). the celebrity interviews are very good and such that you can relate to them. the stories about things in teens' lives are also very good- some are sad but they all make you aware of what really goes on out there. it's a wonderful magazine. it doesn't have an overload of ads like teen vogue or elle girl while still including fashion (though i will say not as much as these two mags because these two are almost entirely all how to look good). seventeen however has a bit more fashion than teen people teen people having more stories and such (though it is right up there with seventeen). seventeen is a happy medium. it's an awesome magazine ",positive

" growing up in the church i've received a lot of christian magazines from in depth analysis on scripture to q&a on highschool drama help but all have fallen short of what young christians today are looking for. i followed relevant magazine before they released their 1st magazine and kept up with the amazing articles online. i was very excited for the debut of a magazine that made god relevant to specific everyday life decisions and made god seem ever more practical in the way we construct our lifestyles. god has obviously done great things with this staff and is still working. their podcast is also great and really demonstrates the character of today's young christian thinkers who are excited in their faith and are willing to show it. they bring a lot to hope and pray for for the christians living in a culture that denies christ. i'm not a twentysomething quite yet but the message of relevant is important which is: put away with your indifference and go out and make a mark on culture for the glory of god ",positive
" i wish i could give this magazine 6 stars. finally an honest magazine for christians. i am the target demographic so i understand the style does not appeal to all but the content can easily relate to anyone who is willing to get past their pre-concieved religious notions and desire biblical truth. i sometimes get sick of the 'relevant' move because it frequently becomes used as an excuse for christians to abuse their freedom as believers but relevant does a fantastic job of giving a balanced look at relevant faith. i don't always agree with every article but i appreciate the open honest and sometimes opposing views. it is not a one-sided or single minded publication. i wish i could afford to get a subscription for all the christians i know ",positive

" this subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed' cd because some chump has stolen it before you could. this rock music magazine is superior to others on the market in my opinion because it has excellent production values i.e. luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions. as a bonus the writing is superior and highly imaginative. an expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched. i like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band. in addition this magazine covers us and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the usa as they are in uk; often these are bands that we might want to know better. the reviews section is always great and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g. 'best r&amp;b albums from the 1970's in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists. this magazine will have you finding buying and liking albums by bands you've never heard of and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price ",positive
" discipleship journal does what many other christian magazines do not do. it provides instruction and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a christ-focused faith. while others may talk about christianity dj asks you to pursue christ through responding to scripture. this isn't an evangelistic magazine like decision or an encouraging magazine per se like moody. it is for the christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what god's word says. it is not for the passive pew sitter. this for the christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between sundays. there is nothing watered-down here. it is published by navpress who like their counterparts the college ministry navigators know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday christian. whether it is a discussion about satan's favorite lies how to study a particular book of the bible or an explanation of what prayer is an is not dj is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our lord and his ways. this is a great tool for two or three people to use together. even a small group... to go through the articles week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life. i've even heard of ccd and sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week's class. i fully recommend discipleship journal. expect your faith to grow. anthony trendl editor hungarianbookstore.co ",positive

" i read scientific american occassionally back in the 80's. at that time i found the articles (especially the physics articles which i love) to be especially dense and poorly supported by graphics. the quality was there but it didn't quite get across to my younger self. now i find the text to be very good and superbly well-supported by side matter and graphics. i would call this an improvement (both in the magazine and perhaps in myself). however i didn't read it regularly back then so perhaps the negative reviewers are correct in saying the magazine has been dumbed down. if so then it was from a very lofty level as the articles continue to require a reasonable background in their subject areas. for example the article computing with quantum knots was just right for somebody who has read a number of non-mathematical treatments of this topic and who like me has read parts of the feynman lectures and things of that nature. it was a sophisticated and intelligent article. there are many more examples i could give. my only gripe with scientific american (and this has been true for decades) is that i just don't like medical articles and the magazine regulary has them. this however is a personal matter and reflects my interests not the quality of the magazine. i strongly suspect the format was changed as some said because the publisher wanted to improve it for everybody and catch a few more readers. certainly i would not have subscribed to the old scientific american. it was too dense and too boring. now it is just about right for me. but that's me. your mileage may vary ",positive

" i bought this magazine as a gift subscription for my sister in law. she raved over it so much i bought it for myself and wow. it is a great magazine. we generally read it cover to cover. it is truly what it claims to be- a magazine about family fun. there is a section on rating or planning family vacations. we could do without this one section but even then it is well written and interesting. other sections include family games outdoor games theme parties crafts and more. kids cooking recipes how other families solved problems toy book and software reviews and even more. it is jam packed with fun things to do. many of the kids things are directed towards children who are about 8. however my children who are younger than 8 enjoy many of the things here and look forward to the magazine so they can find new things to try. my niece who is older than 8 still enjoys the activities in this magazine too. this is a great gift for a teacher or a person who has children.

" unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents/teachers this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do that don't take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials and that are very attractive when finished. i also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it -- very important when it comes to encouraging creativity.

" i have been a subscriber to family fun for 4+ years and i have always enjoyed the magazine. i don't remember ever being disappointed in an issue. i usually will read a magazine once just for entertainment value and then go back later and sort out the articles & ideas i want to keep on file for future reference. in most magazines this equates to a few pages to hang on to at the most. with family fun i always end up with a huge stack of ideas that i want to hang on to. what is even better is that these are tips and bits of information that i actually use and apply in our everyday lives. practical useful and fun are all words i would use to describe this publication. my favorite features include: my great idea - submitted by readers family almanac - seasonal activities and resources and the travel ideas. we have discovered many great places that our on our list to visit someday and we have even been able to add some wonderful and educational fun to trips we have already had planned. some reviews have complained about the magazine being owned by disney. i'm not sure why that is such a problem but i do realize some people don't like disney. the truth is that some major corporation owns just about everything major magazine out there anyway. at least the disney company has helped family fun gain a bigger audience and provided a fantastic web site as a resource companion to the magazine. i don't find that disney is overly promoted (a rarity in the world of disney i know!) in this magazine. there are plenty of reviews and references to very non-disney products such as the harry potter series shrek movies and hundreds of travel ideas that have nothing to do with anything related to a disney enterprise. this magazine has definitely earned the 5 star rating ",positive

" i live in one of the red states in the deep south. therefore unfortunately quality yoga instruction and teaching is very hard to find. but fortunately yoga journal is delivered to my area providing most of the yogic wisdom and learning that i have received through the years. however i agree with other readers i don't care for the ads for cars and cellulite cream ~ (who needs cellulite cream btw when you have a regular yoga practice?) i also do not care for the models they use is this publication most of them look like adolescent girls who have just come from the senior prom! there are a few exceptions here when they do a feature on shiva rea ana forrest or one of the iyengar family members but for the most part this gives a misconception that yoga is just for young skinny women what a shame. having said that there is alot of good material here you just have to get past the aforementioned. there is some very good advice on fitness nutrition and health athletic injuries ~ from hatha yoga and other forms of exercise. there is also many articles on yogic philosophy and spirituality and living our yoga by bringing it into everyday life. all in all a decent publication especially if quality yoga studios and instructors are scarce in your area.

" as a freelance graphic designer only 6 months out of school i would recommend this magazine to anyone else who is in the same boat. not only does this magazine site books that may help designers but it also gives advice on what works - the profiles of top design studios would give anyone ideas on what they need to do to keep business flowing. i come from an entire family of designers illustrators and art directors all whom love communication arts - but that one is far too boring for me. how is more exciting and for only $30 it is at a very reasonable price ",positive
" ... i highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry. i have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas reference or to simply get those creative juices flowing. how's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship. how does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business ",positive
" this magazine really fills the voids that design school leaves behind. i have developed some serious guts in fighting for what i am worth due to this publication. when you are a new designer you get taken advantage of frequently. college did not prepare me to stand up for myself in this competitive market and this magazine not only keeps you up-to-date with the latest in the design realm but also serves as a gutsy motivational read as well. this is a must have subscription for budding designers. what a relief to read a killer design publication from the midwest ",positive
" i got american girl when i was nine. and now im going on my thirteenth birthday and still love it. i think you can be intreseted in teen people type magazines but still love american girl. it has lots of crafts and my favorite part-the lunch box section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school. it is a short magazine but they make up for it by having the jumbo summer issue. i think its definitaly worth the money.

" you can tell a lot about the readership a men's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads. in the issue in front of me they flog the lincoln mkz range rover sport and audi a6. there you have it. we're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the lincoln town car and audi a8 exist until he turns 55. well 52 maybe. but you didn't need the cars to figure out men's health. it's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits beautiful women who seem never not to pout and beefy arms to set off those abs. to be fair there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. but i doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of say dog fanciers. in spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. and if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in men's world where there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you. don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. but you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either. i kind of like it ",positive
" men's health is one of the most popular men's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man. you simply have to know about fitness dieting supplements fashion gadgets etc. the annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks. one of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities. the tips are definitely useful and yet i highly recommend in addition the bestseller scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex for the latest secrets in this area. another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy lean and fit. there are weight loss tips advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast. this is important part of keeping sharp appearance. overall i can reasonably say that you will learn a lot have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover.

" lieven's article &quot;in the mirror of europe: the perils of american nationalism&quot;;is succinct cogent and in my opinion frighteningly accurate. my experience as a professor convinces me that we are in the midst of a nationalistic arrogance whipped by endlessly reptetiive mantras including 9/11 war on terrorism and god which the majority of my students now accept as truth. i have one suggestion i think mr. lieven is overly optimistic when he comments that the neoconservative empire-builders are not yet the majority in positions of power. i feel their reach inlcudes the legislative and executive branch much of the leadership of coporate america an increasing number of jewish and christian denominations much of the media-particularly am talk radio higher education the military and with another four years of the current administration federal courts at all levels. i will bring up this article in many of my discussion groups. i think the article was well-written and important my congratulations to the author ",positive

" one of the funniest magazines around. in a recent article the weekly standard proposed massively expanding the irs to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit. which group did the weekly standard say should be targeted for this increased irs presence (and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100%)? the entertainment industry. the reality tv show contestants the teen-pop singers and the like. the article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry but with all the people that really want fame that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame the industry would continue along (i'm curious if o'rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers). another o'rourke article provided the readers with an alternate inaugural address by bush (subtitle: what if george w. bush weren't a compassionate conservative . . .; quote: the media say that i won the election on the strength of moral values. if the other fellow had become president would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values?). in all seriousness this magazine is a very clear detailed neo-conservative look at the issues (neo-con? - interestingly it would appear that many of the writers used to be liberals). the magazine does not always present just the conservative perspective and does not always agree with bush. another recent article was by a current liberal ex-communist british writer and his reaction to george galloway's testimony before the us senate. an editorial in that recent issue was all about the dictator in uzbekistan an us ally in the war on terror. the editorial notes that toleration of this dictator and his brutality will undermine bush's current foreign policy. it should be noted that the magazine does not seem to have journalists and few staff writers most appear to be called contributing editors. it is jarring though when i read the magazine then read articles in some of my other subscriptions. variety and weekly standard rarely agree. for that matter i'm somewhat surprised by how often the weekly standard and business week disagree. - michael s. briggs - ",positive

",positive
" i grew up reading fangoria when i could sneak it past my parents that is. fangoria magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article. now you are not always going to agree with everything they say but you can always expect them to be honest. when a horror icon is not performing up to snuff like stephen king or john carpenter they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws. fangoria also has the chainsaw awards where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie actor ect and you can also submit a name for horror hall of fame (my guy has yet to win it). they also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people; like the japanese and italian horrors (wow they can make some splatter flicks) and more independent films that wouldn't be showing at the mainstream theater. and they have pictures. all the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color (though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s). this is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan i whole heartedly recomend it ",positive
" a lot of reviewers share similar views as seen in the recurrence of similar criticism of today's magazines. what these complaints also have in common is that they can tend to be fairly uninformed in regard to certain issues. first off we all know that t+l is for affluent travelers. read the publisher's description and it will tell you just that. so if you're not an affluent traveler then don't waste your money on t+l and stick to budget travel. t+l occassionally has affordable stories especially in their affordable issue in march. but don't expect the hotels to be to be under $200 a night. you know why? because nowadays under $200 a night means you're a step above a youth hostal especially in europe where you pay an extra 20% on top of every dollar with today's exchange rate. the point is that t+l never positioned itself as an affordable travel mag so to criticize its shortcomings in that respect is an invalid complaint. anyone who claims the photography is blown out and out of focus hasn't picked up a copy of the magazine since 1999. furthermore if all you saw were straightforward photographs of hotel rooms you'd go out of your mind with boredom. there's nothing wrong with adding a little art to your photography after all photography is in fact art and t+l does a pretty good job of that. and so what if there's a beautiful woman in the photo. no one's saying you have to look like her or promising that she'll be strewn across the bed in your hotel room. use your imagination - this is travel photography in travel + leisure magazine - it ain't newsweek. and with all of the other offensive problems with media today only in america do people complain about too much skin. lastly readers need to understand that magazines don't put in more ads for giggles. a magazine is a business and ad revenue is the way a magazine earns money. so the more ads they have the more profit they have the more money they have to pay better photographers and writers and hire more staff and do more research etc etc etc. no magazine is going to choose to throw away money in order to not offend its readers with fewer ad pages. in fact high ad content is an indication of a high circulation which is an indication of reader satisfaction. the more people a magazine reaches the more companies want to advertise there. the fact of the matter is that there is no perfect travel magazine in existence. they are either too service heavy or editorial fluff or too scientific and adventure-y or just a b-level publication. t+l has its shortcomings it has its top whatever lists and there's a lot of high-end service in there. but it's stunning and has its share of well written and interesting articles ",positive

" he's been in the rock business a long time serving as chief editor/founder of bar bible review and archaeology odyssey; he is also president of biblical archaeology society among many other ventures. i've read his understanding the dead sea scrolls which he mainly edited although he wrote a few articles himself. this is a magazine of substance one i would love to have a subscription to. the issue of july/august 2004 has an interesting article/interview that mr. shanks orchestrated between elie wiesel and frank moore cross the subject being how they understood approached studied the bible from their perspective which their lifes' work ultimately revolves around. one f.m. cross comes from a presbyterian academic background the other wiesel a jewish one. frank moore cross contributed several articles to understanding the dead sea scrolls. he was the only protestant to work on the scrolls among the original team of 7 other people six of whom were catholic clerics; he is an expert in this field. and i just love wiesel's mind i love how he writes and thinks. that one article i think is really illuminating showing how rich in teaching the bible is regardless of its many detractors or fumbling misinterpreters. it is as i've been taught in sunday school g-d breathed it's g-d's words it is a living text even if it contains mostly stories of people long since dead and gone. elie wiesel says of it: wherever you open it any page you know that you are in the presence of something that exists nowhere else. the moral of the article is neither approach wiesel's or cross' toward scripture is wrong it just simply reflects the richness the variety of the text ",positive

" i don't know how to get in touch with the magazine express inc. people but i'd have a serious lecture for them about poor delivery. i always get my magazine about a month late (yes after it's been on newstands for that long) and that's if i recieve it at all. if you move during the middle of your subscription you're screwed. it took months to get them to forward them correctly to my new address and in the meantime the few i missed were just lost. when you're paying upwards of $100 for a subscription and only get 10 a year (french vogue only produces 10 issues) but 3 are lost in the mail you lose 30 percent or your money. bum deal ",positive

" house and garden is a no-holds barred celebration of great *design* primarily of interiors -- and to a lesser extent gardens and exteriors -- but also of product and architecture with a smattering of coverage dedicated to artistans travel wine and music. there is a spirit of high playfulness and arch but subtle airy sensuality pervading h&g ... seems to me it's published by artistic souls for artistic souls ... if you want pedantic safe predictable go for traditional home house beautiful even martha stewart's living or one of the other more mainstream magazines. while it's true that not all of the issues are standouts -- the issues published around the end-of year holidays are generally thin and somewhat wan compared to the spring and fall issues when staff are doubtless away on vacations and content must undoubtedy suffer -- overall house & garden hits it out of the park more often than not. like domino it's newer younger cousin in the field of shelter magazines it breathes the fresh air up there -- up above the cluttered field of clone publications which all proscribe the same cookie cutter look for homes -- and succeeds beautifully. h&g is a real little monthly armchair primer on what's new and noteworthy in the field of residential design and related topics ... blissfully free of tiresome ubiquitous celebrity coverage (the recent cover article on jade jagger notwithstanding). even the font -- a clean stylish art deco -- nods towards the knowing. highly recommended!

" i have been scrapbooking for more than five years and i my style is rather simple. however i recently found myself in a rut and i began wishing i could do the fancier pages so i began receiving creating keepsakes. although i still have no desire to do a two page spread that takes 5+ hours this magazine has been great at inspiring me to try new things as well as just giving me ideas for both scrapbooking and stamping in just the first three issues of my subscription. they do a fairly good job of showing the expensive way to do a page as well as the more economical. additionally there are product reviews and recommendations. i typically buy most of my supplies from at-home parties i found a very helpful recommendation for a silent eyelet setter. some of their articles are geared towards the more advanced/ambitious scrapbooker. for instance a recent article explained how to use certain computer programs to augment photos. the results were beautiful but this was just not up my alley. they also recently did a spread on the scrapooking rooms of some of their staff and i was very very jealous! i may never have any award-winning spreads and i probably will never use my computer to augment my pictures but i know my scrapbooking will be more creative and better looking due to this magazine ",positive

" i was in the travel industry for years and found cn to be an excellent albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations and all other aspects of travel whether upscale or backpack. yes it is not encyclopaedic and yes it is chock full of adverts. however the latter brings the cost of publication no doubt and the former allows cn to cover a wide array of topics in each issue. their travel product ratings are next to none and shortlists the selection process allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions ",positive
" i used to love this magazine. it still has some excellent articles but it is true that there are way too many filler issues now with top 100 lists of things i have no interest in (resort hotels spas expensive travel agents). however on the flip side it never talks down to the reader - the audience is assumed to be well travelled and somewhat sophisticated - which i appreciate. i checked out nat geographic traveller hoping it would be like the cn traveller of old but although it has nicer photography (with few gratuitously scantily clad female shots) it seemed much more mainstream - like i had already done many of the &quot;dream trips&quot; befor i hit my 30s and the information also seemed much shallower. i like geo but i struggle through the french and it's a lot more expensive ",positive
" what i like about this magazine is that the articles are unique and informative. i have bought the last three issues and can't wait for the next one. this magazine covers equipment in a current mode rather than a 6 months to a year behind style so familiar with many of the other photography magazines. this magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time i have picked one up. every article is telling me about or showing me how to implement the lastest techniques from the best photographers in the industry. at the beginning of this year i noticed that some of the popular or modern digital review magazines were running the same old head to head comparisons of consumer cameras that have been out for the better part of a year now. i need to see the technology that is cutting edge or even around the corner. so far this magazine is giving me the best bang for my buck. good luck ",positive
" dwell is a unique (in my opinion) magazine and i like that. unlike many if not most magazines that revolve around home design this magazine does so with environmental concerns in mind as well as style. and as someone who appreciates the less is more mantra i like the fact that the magazine shows off abodes that are small yet spacious. like in the april 2006 issue where aloft in the forest where an urban yet forest feel loft style home on a compact lot are shown. using easy and affordable ideas for the interior elements. yes the magazine has ads but to their credit they must screen clients so that what ads are there fit the style of the magazine. no fluffy dust catching junk ",positive
" creativity is like life insurance. if you are creative you are never afraid because you can design yourself out of any situation. ~li edelkoort if you are interested in items like the nissan actic concept car (that has a matching trailer) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom kitchen or garden this magazine delivers. dwell has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef. for example the april/may 2004 issue had articles on: home cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home. cutting it up - a downtown los angeles loft gets a makeover. stainless chef - designer john picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub. victorian revival - a san franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations. trend diva - jane szita talks about nesting and nihilism. other interesting articles include information on houses that become art short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space. i was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or cd changers which are most modern. well until i can afford a 9500 buck oven i'll keep reading and dreaming. the library in the april/may issue is to die for! big windows and shelves galore. dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! even some of the text is in color. the marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design house or otherwise. the sourcing section also provides page by page information on sources. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like wallpaper an expensive hit-or-miss read. what i like most about dwell is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. there is a very useful marketplace section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. i have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place. this magazine is definitely geared toward the urban loft dweller but i like how they highlight homes with families in mind as well. individual issues are often focused on either geographic or utility-related themes thus keeping a library mandatory for future reference. the photography is superb. if you are tired of design magazines that seem to be talking specifically to designers this is a great reasonably priced alternative for people who simply appreciate great design. highly recommended ",positive
" the wall street journal is one of the most-in-depth business journals available. it is an interesting blend of current events and insightful analysis of prevailing and sometimes not so apparent trends. the quality of reporting is generally balanced and professional. although every newspaper has a political orientation of one sort or the other the wall street journal news reporting is largely free of politics making it a good source of unbiased news and information for most people. however its editorial section is conservative although thankfully the editorial section is a tiny portion of the whole magazine. the journal has a lot of insightful business news that every manager at any level should find useful. the reporters cover the various topics in great detail and with knowledgeable perspective from all sides. they are not afraid to cover corporate transgression with rigour and honesty. the journal also covers various other topics such as personal finance special reports business profiles interviews commentary market and news of note for management personnel.

" of the printed daily newspapers wsj is easily the superior in just about every aspect that really matters. nyt has a lot more and better photographs but they are best viewed on a computer screen. there's not much to argue (regarding the relatively conservative editorial page) in this review that hasn't already been written; and one more center-right midwesterner's recommendation is not going to be of much incremental value. however as an investor and consumer i can state that wsj and its website have been the primary source of credible information about businesses law finance and consumer products. anybody that works for a living has a mortgage or has a long-term savings plan would benefit from reading the wsj as often as possible. there's simply no substitute ",positive
" the wsj has always been required reading for business people and finance wonks but in the past several years the whole thing -- reporting layout editorials -- has been overhauled and the result is one of the best general newspapers in america. first of all business economics finance etc. are extremely important to everyone whether their profession involves these things or not. everyone's lives are shaped by these things and it is important to understand them. second of all a thoughtful couterpoint to the liberal media has long been lacking and the wsj editorials fill the need ... read both the wsj and the new york times every day and you will likley hear two thoughtful but opposing sides of all the major issues confronting our nation and world from which you can begin to develop your own independent view. i cannot recommend strongly enough that everyone subscribe to and read the wsj every (week) day ",positive

" as a straight female i offer a unique perspective on this magazine. i think it's totally hot. i really like the fiction and the guys are such cute young hotties! some of them look a little mean for my taste - they look so challengingly at you instead of invitingly but then again a lot of guys in porn look this way to me - this is normal for porn i guess. very few if any of them are over-beefed (too muscular) and some of them aren't muscular at all which means nice variety. the fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags i've looked at - lots of first times nothing really bizarre or violent. overall a cool magazine ",positive

" i love the city. its particular rhythm and energy is like no other place in the world. 'new york magazine' captures some of this and works to be fashionable and fast glossy and up-to- date stylish and hip( if that is still the word.) i sort of like some of this but a lot of it seems to me trivial and idiotic. and a lot of the trendy stuff is just way out of my league. but 'new york' often has wonderful writing. i cite here james atlas as a particularly good contributor. and it tells you things about the city no other magazine does. some of those things old conservative me will not read. but at times there are pieces here that cannot only be 'fun' but give a real feeling why the big apple is still the 'empire state building( or flatiron building) of all the great cities ",positive
" five big apple stars!! new york magazine is a mind trip to new york city that anyone can take by sitting down for a brisk read of about an hour anywhere in the world. but it'll take much longer to digest the detailed topical sections in the back portion of the magazine. and it covers everything: from a throughly researched interesting and eye-catching cover article to departments that cover movies the latest broadway play reviews the night clubs and a restaurant and club section 'that goes on and on'. i can literally plan forays into the 'big apple' using this magazine from the latest trendy hotel the latest 'unique' meal in an established or a new reataurant the newest on or off broadway play art movie houses showing great independent movies that you probably won't find anywhere else in the us outside of los angeles what artist is appearing at what jazz or rock club and the times of the shows cover or no cover etc etc etc. and yes tons of glitzy ads. it's just a new york state of mind in a magazine that you can use to plan a physical trip or just mentally take the trip. and it will keep you up to date on the current issues in the city. new york magazine sets the standard for all of those other city and state magazines. i love new york city and i love new york magazine. five big stars!

" my boyfriend buys this magazine and likes it a lot. i also take a look at it because in addition to tastefully photographed beautiful women there are a lot of things in it that makes it very interesting even for women. for example there are fresh articles about fashion cars gadgets sex and even celebrities. i read them with interest and skip the models which i guess are the main entertaining element in the magazine for the guys. well that's fine. i am a beautiful woman as well and my boyfriend doesn't rely only on tips from such magazines to keep me very satisfied but also on bestsellers such as scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. that's why i don't mind when he lists maxim and enjoys the photographed beautiful women. maxim can definitely satisfy the hunger for such eye candies of every man who has a strong and happy relationship without getting in trouble. overall it is a very good high quality magazine which has a lot to offer both as photographs and information and i am sure that you will enjoy each issue.

" this past summer i picked up two issues of this magazine and they sat on my shelf for a few months before i finally got around to reading them. i was impressed. the quality of this magazine is higher than any other photographic magazine i've seen. the image quality the paper all top notch. this is a fine arts magazine and doesn't (at least from what i saw) spend time with articles about the technical side of the art. rather it focuses on individual artists and shows samples of their work. there are more great photographs in here than in any other photo magazine i've read. i intend on subscribing.

" i've subscribed to this magazine for years & i've saved every issue. whenever i'm planning a trip i always refer to my collection of traveler for information about my destination. it's easier than ever to find the articles because an index every article ever printed is listed on their web site. the articles are very informative and the pictures are awesome! i love it ",positive

" i have been a subscriber for some time. it's a business publication that does not focus solely on wall street financials - they are there to a lesser degree but this is not the publication if that is what you are looking for. think entrepreneur or general business topics and that's business 2.0. it does not focus on one topic or industry but covers all to some degree - think `oddball' as well. monthly sections include `what's next' `what works' `what's cool'. the articles are cutting edge in some cases well researched and well written with an informal slant. they cover tech marketing product development product design ideas new products and services m&a's and a wide range of general business topics. you will find out about new things before most of your coworkers giving you interesting conversation fodder for the water cooler happy-hour settings. to go even further in figuring out their demographics and target market/s the ads include autos like camry land rover lr3 mini cooper and even the porsche boxster laptops business productivity software like office 2003 business products like copiers and printers mobile calling plans hp credit cards and even lufthansa airline. so if you are not in this demographic maybe they're not targeting your demographic. why buy: you are an up and coming business major or business professional in your `building your career foundation' of your career. you are entrepreneurial minded. you want to keep on top of a wide range of business topics and even some that are not yet making the news. as a gift for someone with these interests ",positive

" eqmm is definitely a worthwhile magazine for any true fan of mysteries. is every story exceptional of course not and that's unrealistic to expect it to be. the stories are however entertaining and you get the opportunity to see something from some of your favorite writers. i think it's enjoyable to read a short story from writers you like whether it is a surefire classic or just another tale. to address some of the issues by the jaded first reviewer look at it from the standpoint of a mystery lover. if the publishers only produced great classic books we would have only a handful of books each year instead of the masses that readers have the fun of combing thru each year. the pages smudge but this is not a magazine that is mass produced like people or time or sports illustrated. at the current price you could probably only get one to two stories a month for glossy pages. if you're reluctant to get a subscription then at least go to your local bookstore and buy the latest copy of eqmm and find out for yourself how enjoyable getting a quick glimpse into dozen of mystery writers can be ",positive
" this magazine is ideal reading for anyone who demands a broad perspective and deep analysis about any current topics related to international foreign policy. years ago i subscribed to the magazine and now as an international relations grad student i use articles in the national interest to address my areas of concentration. the pieces are useful to me because they are so in-depth. i appreciate the pragmatic approach of the writers as well as the wealth of information the editors ensure are featured in each issue. i particularly like the reporter-at-large feature and the recent conversation with henry kissinger segment. top-level experts on foreign policy like diplomats and intelligence officers well-known policy-makers and prestigious journalists make the national interest an exciting read. the broad and varied views enhance my studies. i like the magazine because the centrist perspectives distinguish this magazine from the many others i read like the economist foreign affairs and foreign policy. i find that every article offers level-headed reasoning; no sound bites no bumper-sticker clichs. the articles offer conclusions that allow me to develop my own informed opinions. for anyone who wants to be up to date about foreign policy and who wants to develop well-documented opinions from those who have been on the front lines of world affairs this is the magazine i recommend without reservation. 2nd year graduate student at the yale university mcmillan center of international studies.

" ok so there aren't as many ads (which incidentally helps its portability) but i've been reading computer shopper for 6 years now and i still find it a great read and a very valuable resource. i read every issue not only for its usefulness but also for entertainment value - i guess you can call me a tech geek! it's a great tool for keeping up to date with the latest high tech gear - i particularly like the alfred poor's computer cures articles and how-to guides for us do-it-yourselfers. its features and buying guides are relevant and very informative. over the past few years i have bought several computer systems for myself and family members thanks to advice from the experts at computer shopper and their recommendations on where to buy. so even though i do miss the tech-mall feel of the old magazine i'm still a fan and would recommend it to anyone interested in buying technology ",positive
" i just wrote a review for opm and had forgotten about this magazine. i also used to subscribe and had recently let my subscription run out. i will not say it is not because i do not like this magazine but because i am trying to save some money. but the fact is that this is probably the best multiplatform gaming magazine on the market. the reviews are smart and fresh never hackneyed or cliched the way a lot of other magazines are (and some of my reviews sorry guys!). but the introductory article in each and every magazine by the chief editor always sounds like it has been written by a harvard grad with a layman's ability to make everything easy to understand. he has a way of making every article within the magazine all come together. never biased they are not afraid of telling it like it is in their reviews. i would highly recommend subscribing to this magazine and like somebody else mentioned better to go directly to the store and get the discount card. after $150 - $200 in used game purchases it pays for itself. highly recommend! mc white said: if you're a gamer than you gotta have this magazine! edit: believe it or not when i got home yesterday just after writing this review i had a copy of the september issue in my mailbox. i had forgotten i had called customer service about a missed issue. they were nice enough to extend me a two issue subscription free of charge to cover my missed issue. i was quite impressed and tickled pink when i got my newest copy in the mail when i arrived at my posh homestead. thank you game informer for continued excellent service and a wonderful magazine.

" i have been subscribing to this mag for a couple years and think it's one of the best gaming mags available. i have several different consoles and appreciate that they review games for all platforms. i like the rating system (1-10) instead of the too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5 and find the reviews well written and objective. while i have been gaming for years i am not necessarily versed in computer lingo but i never feel like an idiot after reading this mag; the writing is erudite but very easy to understand. i read several different gaming magazines each month and feel this magazine strikes exactly the right balance between the more serious and more frivolous gaming magazines in the industry. one suggestion: if you have a gamestop or affiliated store in your neighborhood get your subscription through them. for about $15 you receive a 12-year subscription and a card that gives you 10% off used games at these stores as well as an extra 10% trade-in value on your used games (sometimes there will be a coupon in that month's mag to upgrade to 20% for both!).

" in the world of gaming there are specialized magazines for each system (playstation magazine xbox mag etc.) most of which suck because they only report on (duh) games on their respective systems. others like electronic gaming monthly encompass most systems but only do it half-assed not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it. then there's gameinformer. there are many things that set gameinformer apart from many other gaming magazines: 1) they have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play. if the game sucks they say so; if it's an awesome game they'll tell you about it. 2) matt helgeson (senior gaming editor) and the other editors actually inform you about the game's most necessary attributes: its esrb rating (e to m) their rating for the game (from 1 to 10) and a brief introduction to the game's faults and successes. best of all however they include screenshots from the game- and most screenshots rock. these are just some of the reasons that gameinformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market. i have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only and i hope my review has explained why.

" overall this is the best gaming magazine i have read. it covers all consoles gives sensible (and funny) reviews and previews the hottest upcomming games. most games are reviewed by two people adding to the accuracy of the score. it has a rating of 1-10 10 being the best a rating which precious few games recieve. the previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games. some of them are one page long some ten. they all include pictures and most have an estimated release date. also there is a section on news in the game industry. ususlly near the beginning of the magazine they include news on developers consoles and the big names in the industry. all in all this is a great magazine and well worth your money because each issue is well over 100 pages ",positive

" car and driver is the multi-purpose auto magazine. it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world and magazines like motor trend which focus on the more practical. the magazine is always a fun intereseting read and keeps you up to date on teh auto world. i must however say that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend and it doesn't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track (and definitely falls short of road and track's superb photography.)

" i'm 25 years old and new to the atlantic [monthly]. not having read the publication for some twenty-odd decades like the rest of the reviewers my opinion is this: the magazine is wonderful. it's infinitely more literate and illuminating than most other periodicals. i'm letting my subscription to time run out (talk about an also-ran...). some of what the other reviewers have said is true: there do seem to be an awful lot of stories about war/armed forces and at times i would concede a slight liberal bend. but neither are enough to dissuade me from continuing my subscription. so younger readers my advice is switch off the tv throw out your news weeklies and subscribe. (but keep visiting cnn.com to stay abreast of current news--this is only a monthly magazine! ",positive
" i discovered the am some 2 or 3 years ago. since then i have become an addicted reader to it. more than to any other magazine at the moment. let's start saying what the am is not: is not about news is not about business is not about nice and colored pictures. the am has two main focuses. one is current affairs with a special focus on the macro conditions of the us (mainly economy and politics) and international affairs. the other one is the arts with a special focus in reviewing high-quality (and sometimes rare) books. i like the am for its focus in current affairs. in this monthly you will read long articles about issues like to cite some examples that come to mind: - simulation of a principals meeting to discuss alternatives to engage with north korea - war game of an attack to iran - presidential candidates their lives and their campaign strategies - state of affairs of the american educational system - potential causes of an eventual economic crisis in the us the am sits in the same hall of fame as the economist and foreign affairs. the main differences are that the economist has a relatively short time frame and thus focuses on the news of the week and what they mean for the mid term. foreign affairs on the other hand is more scholarly in nature. the am sits somehow in the middle. it is written mainly by senior journalists (so it's less scholarly) and its monthly focus allows it to disentangle itself from the relative sameness of every week's news. the am goes beyond the futility of news reporting but stops before it gets into the boringness of scholarly writing. if you want to enrich your view of the world with a quality monthly if you are open-minded and are willing to read new points of view if you want to get closer to the real issues behind foreign and economic policy the am is for you. on the other hand if you have more short-term preocupations if you are more closed than open to new points of view or if you want to look at international and economic matters with a more scientific approach then the am is not for you. again as i said the am also has an arts section. it's very good but it's not the reason why i buy it. other may ",positive
" i first came across taste of home magazine about 10 years ago. some friends of mine were quite the experimental couple who loved to try out new recipes. as the recipient of tasty appetizers dips and desserts i asked them for the recipes. it was then that they shared this magazine with me...and i've been a subscriber ever since! each magazine features several special features as well as mainstay departments such as potluck pleasers my mom's best meal getting in the theme of things and super snacks and appetizers. arguably the best part of this magazine is their clip-and-keep section of recipes which feature color photos of the dish. just cut out the recipe and ouila! it's ready for your recipe box. other information-packed sections include ask our food editor touring country kitchens ted's toothpick contest lively leftovers and more. each issue also features a recipe contest to win cold hard cash. some of the great recipes that are in the most recent issue include: swiss-stuffed porkchops open-faced turkey tacos spinach shrimp fettuccine coffee 'n' cream brownies cucumber potato salad asparagus chicken crepes hearty jambalaya barvarian strawberry pie and many more. besides being tasty dishes one of the great things about the recipes in taste of home is that they don't call for some exotic ingredients. rather they feature ingredients that can be found in any department store...even if you live in an out-of-the-way rural area! some of the recipes aren't exactly quick which is why i give it four stars. there are certainly quite a few quick and easy recipes but there are also some that take quite a bit of prep work. if you're looking for a magazine with mostly quick recipes try their sister publication quick cooking (i subscribe to that one as well...and actually like it better.) taste of home has no ads (amazing!) so it's nice that the magazine is chock full of recipes and information--not fillers and ads. this magazine also is very country so if you're looking for something trendy and cosmopolitan this mag may not be for you. but if you like down-home country cookin' you'll likely love this magazine ",positive
" imagine making a beehive cake or a honey-citrus iced tea. when looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors. you will be cutting out a lot of recipes! in fact i'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing. there are 16 pages of recipes in a card format. the favorite meal section and cooking for one or two is always of interest. it shows you how to put an entire meal together and all the recipes are included. there is also a section where you can view enviable country kitchens. then you can learn how to make ordinary foods extraordinary. add curry powder to chicken salad or add brewed coffee to cookie dough. the men who run the range section is a series featuring men who love to cook and then you can also find out what people are eating in various states across the country. these are ideas and recipes from real cooks across america. one time i looked in the does anyone have...? section and found a note about a woman who was looking for specific items. after sending her a small box she then reciprocated and sent me the most beautiful framed pressed flowers. it is a fun section where you can read about recipes people are looking for and if you have the recipe there is an address where you can mail the item. i recently learned how to make rosemary crackers and someone is looking for a recipe for various crackers. this magazine also has info on cooking schools all over the country. you could also be a field editor and share your recipes cooking tips and other ideas with the home-office staff. you could literally end up in this magazine! some of the delicious recipes i've been clipping from this magazine include: grilled sirloin steak crispy fried chicken herbed seafood skewers chicken with rosemary vegetable cheese tortellini grilled turkey burgers beehive cake honey citrus iced tea tonight i made a chicken dish with homemade stuffing and a mushroom gravy that my husband really loved. i think this magazine inspires me to cook more and i have never read this magazine without tearing out pages galore. now i'm dreaming about the pear crisp with lemon sauce and the raspberry cheesecake pie. ~therebeccareview.com ",positive
" mr. hayek apparently despises free thought. furthermore his ignorance of libertarian philosophy is clear; discounting his opinion is appropriate. i'm guessing he is a republicrat and finds the socialist ideas found in the corrupt two party system satisfying. funny considering his namesake frederich hayek is one of the greatest libertarian thinkers of all time and one of my personal heros. but i digress: reason magazine has been in my mailbox every month for well over 20 years and i would buy a lifetime subscription if i could. not every issue is a five star issue but on the whole reason is the most interesting periodical on the market. that said reason has dropped a notch in quality ever since the brilliant virginia postrel left the editor's post several years ago. she is a true intellectual and kept reason at a consistently high level. i still love to read my issue every month and while i don't always agree with the positions i am always stimulated ",positive

" like one commentor said...the truth hurts. it does...if you're happy with your martha stewart and scott peterson news do not buy this magazine. if you want the real dirt left or right wing...this is it. they shoot from the hip. if you want the truth and not what you will see on the mainstream media this is the magazine. they are well known to publish stories that the ny times is afraid to publish. as a matter of fact most of the writers on mother jones and the nation used to write for the times. and i just heard last week two stories written by ny times writers that they're publishers wouldn't print. so guess who did? if you doubt me look up the 25 most censored stories of 2004 and 2005 ",positive
" excellent independent research! investigative journalism at its best. it is neither a liberal nor a conservative publication for neither republicans nor democrats are spared. politicians make a lot of claims and mother jones looks beyond their words to see if they actually put them into action. as you will see when you read mother jones many politicians (both democrats and republicans) do not put their money where their mouth is. also ignore the reviews saying that it is biased. apparently they consider facts that are inconvenient and run counter to their beliefs to be biased. what is interesting is that if they came across an article in mother jones that supported their beliefs that they agreed with then they would probably say that the article was impartial and fair. hey the truth hurts sometimes. finally the reviewers claiming that this is a liberal magazine because it talks about bush so often are misguided. mother jones does so many articles on bush because he makes so many claims and says so many things that are not supported by his actions. he is an easy target. they do articles on kerry and others too.

" i had heard of books & culture. i had never read it. and then a good friend from college called one afternoon and told me he was sending me a gift subscription. i've never enjoyed a periodical this much. it has given me hope. when george w. bush was reelected the word evangelical was spoken across the country in blame. regardless of your political stance the point is that the evangelicals were seen as stupid enough to reelect what much of the rest of the nation saw as a poor president. even today evangelical is often used to connote backwardness or stupidity. but books & culture blows this assumption out of the water. have you stumbled across another publication that will voice god-fearing perspectives on gender roles in the church current philosophy and theology current film and literature politics economics and cultural phenomena such as the internet? this is books & culture's most recent issue thoughtfully done and honestly written even when the conclusions reached seem somewhat outside of the traditional conception of things. as a subculture we love answers. but it seems we are entering a new period of growth in our communities one in which questions will be equally important and appropriately valued. why not begin with the tough questions? you'll find many of them in books & culture. along p.s. dennis if you ever read this thanks for the subscription bud.

" fantasy&sciencefiction magazine has been around since 1949 and is in my opinion one of the better scifi and fantasy mags on the market. it has a proven track record of publishing outstanding short stories novellas and novelettes that have later gone on to win hugo nebula and dark fantasy awards which brings me to the 2006 june issue of the magazine: the june issue features an outstanding and very creepy novella entitled hallucigenia by laird barron. i predict an award for this chilling novella which will be just another in a long and esteemed list of award worthy tales from fantasy&sciencefiction. barron's story could be classed as a cthulhu mythos tale although no where does the author allude to h.p. lovecraft's works. it is simply that the recurring theme is a recognizable one to us mythos fans. highly recommended reading and worth the subscription price.

" the wine spectator is the ultimate guide to wine. as a magazine it gives trusted up-to-date information on wine and related issues. i look forward to each issue and always find something interesting. i would definitely recommend this periodical to all wine lovers ",positive
" there's certainly a lot to hate about wine spectator - and for that matter wine advocate. many winemakers decry the existence of both magazines and usually lay the blame entirely at robert parker's doorstep for making the 100-point rating system an industry standard. wine spectator's scores have gotten better with time as have their articles. they've shied away from california glitz and have looked more into food. also the education classes that they list on their website are becoming increasingly more helpful. apparently they listened to much of the criticism and worked toward creating a more respected magazine. i think they've done well.

" the wine spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you're rich or that you soon could be all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine. there's lots of deadly serious material in this glossy pleasing publication. but if you're a lover of wine who is *not* rich - the category includes this reviewer - you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor. just enjoy the game. that game includes a travelogue of the world's wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month-by-month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself. this reader is in it for the long haul - i hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog - and the wine spectator is my companion along the way. my job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine-splendored places like france south africa chile argentina australia new zealand and - of course - northern california. but with wineries now in 49 of the usa's fifty states what's *not* a wine region these days? on those business treks i find myself out for dinner as often as not. it's personally satisfying to know just enough to order a pinotage in capetown since only south africa produces this varietal or to opt for one of argentina's persuasive malbecs because they're just *that* good. we're not talking wine snobbery here just satisfaction at the margins of life's all too margin-less journeys. if this sounds like your game the wine spectator may be a worthwhile investment. even if not consider splitting a subscription with a colleague. that's what i do. at half the price i get a fine magazine and avoid burdening my bookshelves with one more heavy beautiful pleasant magazine. life can deal you worse ",positive
" i subscribed to ws for a couple years in the late 90s and loved the magazine. it keeps a balance between reviews of wines both new (which is the main emphasis) and older vintages and background stories on vintners and so on. the writers are almost all very good (and i'm a professional writer myself) -- only one of them do i dislike and he doesn't review the wines. both the wine connoisseur and the novice can profit from reading this publication. i only dropped the subscription because i moved and the collection no issue of which i wished to discard was occupying more and more space on my bookshelves. now i subscribe to the online edition so i can check ratings before i buy a wine. the ws in addition to parker and other reviewers perform an essential service for critical consumers who can't otherwise judge whether a bottle is worth the price asked. and we need ws and parker and all to tell us when the best reds are ready to drink -- some really great ones are not mature for more than a decade. i drank the highly rated chateau canon 1982 for which i'd paid over $100 17 years after harvest and my group could tell it wasn't ready -- still closed down. sure enough if i had read spectator carefully i'd have picked another bottle for that occasion because they said it wasn't yet mature. robert parker has the reputation for being more influential for high-end wines but wine spectator's scores are generally pretty close to his. and they review a broader spectrum as noted by other commentators below. ws will often steer you to excellent buys for under $15 or even under $10. if you get only one of these per month or steers you away from a very overpriced bottle the subscription (about $50) pays for itself ",positive
" this is a light and colorful newspaper. i remember when it first came out .the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole. it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country. the reporting itself is clear and very readable. the paper lacks weight and depth. it has a lot of variety in its features and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable. it's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting. and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers.

" about two years ago i became a subscriber to shape mainly because i had received it for free as part of a package deal with another magazine. i had always liked browsing through issues of shape in the supermarket and i thought that being a subscriber would help support my fitness goals. overall i have enjoyed shape and found it to be useful but there definitely are some negatives and the magazine might not be for everyone. but first the good. like many others have mentioned what i most enjoy about shape is their real-life weight stories featuring a nice variety of women some of whom actually needed to *gain* weight in order to be healthy. i also love their relatively new feature in which they follow one of their own staffers on a year-long weight loss journey. many of their other regular features are also excellent particularly the body part-focused strength exercises and other how-to exercise guides. and i especially like that shape uses reader models with so many of their articles--real life women of various ages (although admittedly mostly in the 25-35 range) with normal healthy strong bodies. finally their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations on traditional exercises and the recipes are often quite good as well. the main negative has already been brought up by many others here: the use of too-skinny not overtly fit or strong models to illustrate much of the magazine. i find this extremely disappointing; i understand that to sell magazines the models probably have to conform to some traditional standards of attractiveness but those of us buying the magazine want to see women who are not only fit but also strong--show us some muscles now and then! as i said above the reader models are great; the women are usually quite fit but they have muscles and curves too which is wonderful to see. shape may be trying to make some improvements in this area as the last few covers have featured famous women who do exercise (such as denise richards) but they still have a long way to go. and while they're at it i hope they will return to having their cover models dress in fitness wear not bathing suits! they can still show off their model's physique and showcase cute fitness wear at the same time. similarly i would like to see the magazine get rid of the fashion segment at the end *unless* they start focusing it on exercise clothing not haute couture. if you are overweight and/or new to exercising you may find the magazine discouraging but if you can get past some of the negatives it can also be inspiring. i think it's up to each individual to determine whether a magazine like this is likely to hurt or help her fitness efforts; for me it is helpful but this definitely might not be the case with everyone ",positive
" i subscribe to entertainment weekly premiere and any magazine with a photo of johnny depp or hobbits on the cover but scr(i)pt is my favorite magazine. every issue of scr(i)pt has articles by the screenwriters of movies that are just opening explaining something about how the movie was written and featuring excerpts from the screennplay of that movie. these are triply helpful as they (1) provide insight into how a successful screenwriter works his craft (2) supply brief examples of what the movie you just saw (or are about to see) looks like on the page and (3) are a useful tool in deciding which movie to go see saturday night. each issue also has articles of the more general how to... variety although these range from how to write great scenes/characters to how to pitch to studios to why studio execs are using your script to wrap fish. for a while there was a series of articles that were simply a compilation of all the genre cliches written in the hopes that if you knew what they were you could avoid them; they were invariably hilarious. these how to/writing advice articles are often extremely funny (this is not meant as an insult--they are meant to be funny as well as helpful). finally every issue has the news on sales contest winners and whatnot that is essential for any working screenwriter with a generous helping of heartwarming success stories to keep your spirits up while you're waiting to hear from the studios. i highly recommend this magazine. enjoy ",positive

" inc. magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity. with inc. you get timely advice on taxes marketing financing and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day. probably the strongest point of inc. is the way it presents important information to readers. the authors of this magazine get directly to the point. they don't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact. even when the news is bad like with regulations taxation etc. inc. lets you have it in a direct manner. this is good because i get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts. inc. writers are direct and i respect them for that. if there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine i can think of only two: the lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that while nice to read about present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners. inc. is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth. this is fine but i would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground. and every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich. again this is ok but i would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well- off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic. still inc. is a very good publication for small business owners. it provides some good timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns. the price to subscribe is low too making inc. magazine a must for owners of small growing companies.

" i am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that i prepare for my family. the beauty of gourmet is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture. i also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods and on quick methods and dishes. i have read gourmet off and on for at least 20 years. the magazine has changed somewhat during that time. the focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine. the features of the june 2006 edition are as follows: tiki time: a collection of polynesian food and drink we are family: recipes for a summer party a greece less traveled: northwestern greece travel and recipes in the section seasonal kitchen there is a very well done article on salads. the roasted vegetable panzanella is fantastic. in the gourmet everyday section i always enjoy the three regular articles: quick kitchen (30 minutes meals) five ingredients and 10 minute mains. these are always tasty and usually all quick. if you are a foodie and/or you want to be this magazine is a nice starting point. i would suggest that you pick up a couple of issues on the newsstand to confirm that this magazine is for you before subscribing. i highly recommend this magazine for budding home chefs.

" i have subscriptions to a few magazines and i have to say seventeen is the one i'm always looking forward to. this magazine has a little bit of everything- fashion and make-up tips how to be healthy (not just stick thin!) tips for school fun (not very useful but fun) stuff on guys and love teen stories and important information to be aware of. it's fun but also informing. the models are normal girls and this mag shows things that not only a size 0 or 2 girl can wear but also clothing that can be worn by a girl who's size 4 8 or 16. many styles from girly to goth are shown not just one. the clothing and accessories are also affordable and can be found at stores in your nearby mall. seventeen isn't all fashion. it's really all about embracing who you are and making the most of life. it's about feeling good about yourself and loving yourself for who you are and not what you aren't. i've used some of the tips on health skin care feeling good and make-up and you know what? they do work and are actually helpful (***gasp***). the celebrity interviews are very good and such that you can relate to them. the stories about things in teens' lives are also very good- some are sad but they all make you aware of what really goes on out there. it's a wonderful magazine. it doesn't have an overload of ads like teen vogue or elle girl while still including fashion (though i will say not as much as these two mags because these two are almost entirely all how to look good). seventeen however has a bit more fashion than teen people teen people having more stories and such (though it is right up there with seventeen). seventeen is a happy medium. it's an awesome magazine ",positive

" relevant magazine has great articles for people who are in to culture and faith. many of the reviews are of secular artists the spiritual content or message (or lack thereof) of the music they sing films they make and books they write. they also review christian artists many who are on the fringe. this is a great magazine for those who are interested in these things. if you just want a 'youth-oriented' christian magazine with bible studies and how-to's you'll probably be disapointed ",positive
" this is not my favorite fitness magazine. this is the size of a reader's digest but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine. i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover. they share reasonable and attainable goals and suggestions for us normal people. the magazine seems to cover a wide age group with information that is good for both young and old. they do offer recipes workout suggestions and much more. the magazine takes little time to read and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy. i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase ",positive
" i just received my first order and i love it! this magazine covers a broad range of topics and includes designer techniques current trends period styles and so much more. it has tons of vibrant pictures to illustrate the articles. i think this magazine would be ideal for someone just starting out in design to gain a basic understanding on a wide range of topics and also for the experienced designer to keep up with current trends and fill in the gaps with knowledgeable tidbits ",positive
" as a potential interior designer i find that this magazine is both realistic and elegant in the articles it provides for the professional and for the hobbiest. i have a subscription and i find that studying the designers the styles and the themes i have learned so much about the work of a designer. i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys color fabrics or just pictures of beautifully designed rooms and interiors ",positive

" i picked up a copy of health at my local grocery store mostly out of curiosity. i found myself enjoying it enough so that i will be ordering a subscription. here's why: 1.it encompasses every facet of health not just diet or exercise. as one reviewer noted it is broken down into categories: looks living moving feeling and flavor (it was just redone). the articles in each seem to be well-written and are enjoyable. i particularly enjoy the feeling and living sections as they are something that is rarely found in other magazines. 2. unlike many other magazines i found myself marking or wanting to mark so many pages to keep or check out further that in ended up being a good part of the magazine. i like most others enjoy getting the most for my money. while everyone has a different idea of what constitutes a good magazine this one will soon be a regular fixture in our house ",positive
" i have been reading health off and on since i was in high school in the late 1980s and overall i love this magazine! the articles are usually rather interesting and there is always at least one long article that i find relevant to my life or curiosities. however there are times when the topics/articles border on resembling cosmo and glamour rather than really being related to health. overall i recommend health as a great read for entertainment purposes and a great reference for health-related issues but don't always expect nobel prize winning research data in every article ",positive
" this is a pretty good magazine. the niche is that it goes out every week and thus it is the most current business news magazine out there (if you compare it to fortune forbes...). i always find 3-4 interesting articles there but don't expect to read cover to cover ",positive
" i've been a bw subscriber for 8 years now and if the magazine stays as good as it currently is i see at least 60 more years of subscription. bw is a very well balanced magazine focusing mainly on business trends and headline news. a majority of their articles are extremely informative well written and objective. if there is an opinion piece it is clearly stated as commentary. i enjoy the economic viewpoint where it alternates between right and left wing economists (hubbard for rep. tyson for dems). bw is also forward thinking in writing about trend analysis and disecting what the future may bring. there is a good snippet of international business. a couple weaknesses of the magazine: -tech & you column. the guy writes about the same category of gadgets over and over again (mainly pda & what not). i would like to see more articles about hdtv laptops desktops software etc. tech & you appears to be written for either a road-warrior or a technophobe. -personal lifestyles section. seems like the magazine is catering towards a more upscale crowd writing about exotic vacations and expensive wines that only either a very rich person or a very debt prone person could afford. i also find the magazine to be weak in covering the retail sector. i'd like to read more full articles about companies average consumers deal with on a weekly basis. the kmart/sears deal was largely overshawdowed. all in all if i could only choose one magazine to receive this would be the one.

" before i begin there's one thing you need to know: i can't cook. i have skills that can't be beaten when it comes to heating stuff in the microwave and i can use the toaster oven to uh toast things but that's it. no whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals for me which probably makes me the only person who can't cook who actually buys this magazine. this should say a great deal about just how entertaining every day with rachael ray actually is. of course as you might expect i like rachael ray. it really would be weird for someone to buy this magazine if they didn't cook and they also hated rachael and i'm not that weird! however although this is ostensibly a cooking-centric magazine i'd argue that it really reflects rachael's attitude and personality. her enthusiasm love of a wide variety of food and adventurous spirit shine through on every page. by all reports rachael was very hands-on in developing this magazine and it shows. to those who ask why they need to read a rachael ray magazine since rachael is all over television these days (most recently with her own syndicated daytime talk show) chew on this: rachael isn't taking over the world by accident. she's obviously doing something right to be dominating both the food network's daily schedule and the bestseller lists (for her ever-increasing line of cookbooks). people just can't get their fill of her! so what exactly is her secret? i think it boils down to these factors: a combination of approachability and charisma which are key ingredients of superstardom (think of talented-yet-friendly stars such as tom hanks or shakira). add to that a dash of optimism mixed with a spirit of adventure as witnessed on my favorite ray show $40 a day in which she explores a new tourist destination each week trying to eat well on an insanely low budget. but what about rachael ray in magazine form you're wondering? well in my opinion every day with rachael ray appeals to all tastes by brilliantly translating her unique appeal from the tv screen to the printed page. as i mentioned earlier i probably won't be cooking anything from the many recipes included in each issue but i still like checking them out. each recipe includes a picture of the finished product and the recipes have lots of variety and creativity... yum-o! and some are so simple like sandwiches or salads that i get the feeling i might actually be able to attempt them if i really wanted to (see? rachael's can-do attitude even gets through to the kitchen-incompetent!) the travel articles and the short pieces (about a wide range of topics such as buying cheese making mistakes in the kitchen etc.) are also fun. but as a rachael fan i especially enjoy the parts of the magazine written by or about rachael. one nice feature is a q & a in which readers can send in questions about rachael which she personally answers. as someone who has participated in a lot of celebrity q & a's online in the past i love these chances to get to know more about someone famous who you may never meet in person. in fact the only reason i haven't rated every day with rachael ray five stars is because i'd like to see even more rachael-related photos and articles in each issue... how cool would that be?! also i'm hungry for more interactivity: perhaps some food-themed sudoku or some search-a-words. but to be fair this is a relatively new magazine and all great magazines need time to sort out what does and doesn't work. and so far every day with rachael ray has hit the ground running and is off to a great start. i was actually the first person to buy the very first issue at my local bookstore when it came out (i got lucky and happened to be there as they set up the display) and i've looked forward to each new issue ever since that day. if you like rachael ray you can't go wrong here... start spending every day with rachael ray and take a bite outta life. even if you can't boil water!

" i remember when this magazine was the lone conservative voice on the newstands. i too have memories of many long latinate sentences which mr.buckley provided and i had to try and figure out. it is not that i always agreed much less understood him. but i did feel that he was a man walking to the sound of his own drummer who had a real concern for public life in america and his own ideas of how to make it better. i also saw through the years that he edited a very intelligent opinion- journal which explored many aspects of american reality. the magazine today seems to me still to be of high- quality though mr. buckley is no longer at the helm.

" in christmas of 2005 i decided i wanted the most interesting and best cooking magazines out there. but which ones to pick? after buying one here and there i found three that i absolutely love. saveur was one. the recipes are nice though some i wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole (ethnic ingredients that don't appeal to me). but the stories and the pictures... they aren't just amazing they're astounding! where national geographic talks about certain things or places saveur takes you to different places and shows you what's there and how they eat. they showed me ireland and i even made colcannon (a mashed potato and cabbage dish) everyone loved it. i made a french dish last night that was amazing. it was a little time consuming but worth it! i do have admit i was a little disappointed with my first issue i received from them with my subscription. it looked like a dog ate it then ran through the water with it. it's readable but i wasn't happy. they also promise two exclusive magazines for new subscribers. i've never seen them. but i have been getting my magazines and they look good. i was thinking about it the other night my three magazines i picked... one was articles and recipes about healthy eating (eating well) one was easier recipes with no articles (everyday food) and then saveur. if i could only pick one to keep... it would be saveur. it's really that good of a read.

" this is simply a beautiful magazine printed on heavy glossy paper. its pages contain many beautiful photographs of different foods wines and the countries from which they originate. it is not only a food and wine magazine with wonderful recipes that are easy to follow it is also a travel guide of sorts with a great deal of information on other countries their food and wine their restaurants and their culture. usually included are some fascinating historical details of how a custom associated with a particular food may have come about. the articles are invariably well-written and offer a wealth of fascinating information. i am a tea lover and i love going to afternoon tea with its repast of scones dainty sandwiches and light cakes. so i particularly enjoyed an article that the magazine recently had that focused on tea. it transported the reader to devon england with its afternoon tradition of tea and scones accompanied by clotted cream and jam which is often referred to as a cream tea. of course a beautiful bone china tea pot and bone china cups are essential to the having of a proper cup of tea. this too is discussed in the article. photographs of an authentic village tearoom in devon were included as well as recipes for making scones tea sandwiches black currant jam strawberry jam and victoria sponge cake. the article went on to discuss how clotted cream is made. it interspersed the discussion with personal anecdotes from those who make clotted cream. a guide was included for devon in terms of where to stay where to eat and where to go for tea. the article went on to discuss the differences among the various available tea experiences detailing what constitutes an afternoon tea a cream tea and a high tea and giving some of the historical underpinnings of each. i so enjoyed this article! even if i never physically go to devon i feel as if the magazine had transported me there as it was vividly drawn by so expert and sure a hand. the magazine has these types of articles in every issue covering regions from all over the world including those in the united states. the magazine also contains a helpful section titled the pantry which is a guide to resources that have to do with food products and kitchenware related to articles in the current issue of the magazine. this makes it invariably easier for the reader who may wish try some of the more esoteric recipes to find what one needs. it is little wonder that i love this magazine. those who are interested in wonderful food excellent and easy to follow recipes other cultures and customs as well as traveling will simple adore this magazine. it makes a wonderful gift. i know because this magazine was a gift to me and one for which i am grateful as it is a gift that one gets to enjoy again and again each and every month.

" the writer is the premier magazine for writers of all varieties. kalmbach is known for publishing a great series of specialty periodicals and this one is extremely well written and edited as is appropriate for the subject matter. the magazine is best for aspiring writers of fiction with the clear majority of column inches. poetry is also covered well and nonfiction (my area of interest) while covered is definitely in third place. in the end though most techniques for fiction also help nonfiction authors and vice-versa: i read every issue cover to cover regardless of area of concentration because i have gleaned some of the best tips from articles that superficially seemed not to pertain to my writing. the magazine is very good at covering new developments in the publishing world and features in-depth reporting on subjects like print on demand (pod) publishing. many articles concentrate on in-depth technique implementation while the utilitarian short pieces that cut through grammatical tedium and stylistic methodologies reinforce the basics. if you are interested in writing as a professional or just for personal satisfaction the writer is the magazine for you.

" while many mainstream publications have been shying away from calling members of the current american government into account for their transgressions - from bribery and theft to misinformation and cover-ups of sexual escapades - the nation has done its job and reported the facts. for its trouble many of those who lean the same way as the current administration lambast the magazine as too liberal and naively progressive. so let's put it this way: if you value truth over lies and think the rights of the little guy are just as important as the rights of fat cats you will like the nation. but be warned -- the nation is rife with page after thorough page of intense reporters' writings and even some clever poetry but only rarely has pictures. which may be the real reason why right wingers don't like it ",positive

" the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u.s. constitution thomas jefferson once wrote: i read no newspaper now but ritchie's and in that chiefly the advertisements for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper. [letter to nathaniel macon january 12 1819] the nation is not a newspaper. rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment tv doesn't dare to. those americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call the nation left wing liberal radical etc. etc. plato had written 2300 years ago his allegory of the cave: behold! human beings living in an underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. plato's punchline was ... and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him? and so dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans cannot stand to look into directly. it is much less painful for them simply to say: ... the nation's political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world - situation. for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation. it prints the patriotic incisive truth.

" instyle is my favorite fashion magazine out there. it is much more reader-friendly than vogue - much cleaner layout the font is easier to read and the writing is clear witty and less dry. i've been reading instyle for about 3 years and each issue never disappoints me. the focus of the magazine is definitely fashion but there are also makeup tips and celebrity news. the magazine targets a much broader audience than more haute couture magazines like vogue. my favorite section is the look which highlights celebrity fashion and also has a section at the end that profiles a specific designer or label. instyle also features many tips and recommendations on beauty products. the best issue of the year is without a doubt in march or april when they do best beauty buys. after polling beauty experts and testing hundreds of products they feature the best beauty products in ever imaginable category. i've discovered some of my favorite beauty products through these issues and it's nice to be able to trust a source without wasting your money on testing out expensive products that don't work for you. it is the best source for getting the most reliable products out there from hair care products to makeup. i have seen several women at sephora clutching torn out pages from instyle's best beauty buys and frantically searching for the right mascara. i understand that vogue is an institution now but instyle offers a much better alternative and provides articles that you actually want to read and tips you actually use.

" i'm a culinary historian and author (california pioneers their stories culture and cuisine)who spends a lot of time delving into the pages of history especially food history. when i want to give my burned-out peepers a break i reach for this magazine. as much as i love the food articles -- mostly because as great as they look realistically they are quite do-able for just about anyone -- what i really find useful is the ask martha column in which practical answers are given to problems readers write in about. and then there are the craft projects...i have tried several and was surprised by my success. i credit this to the well laid-out photos and very clear instructions. my advice is if you are looking for a magazine that touches on every aspect of living and enjoying a well-designed (and i do not mean haughty) lifetsyle then you cannot go wrong with martha stewart living. also the special holiday ideas are the best ever...makes one wonder how do they keep coming up with such unique ideas that are do-able for the general population?[...

" the economist is a great weekly magazine with in-depth balanced and enlightening journalism. the articles are largely expertly written by knowledgeable people. the writing in the economist is interesting and insightful with articles conveying detailed and yet condensed information. the magazine has contributions from senior people from all over the world making it interesting and relevant to a worldwide readership. the editors and journalists of the economist need to be applauded for the broad range of well-written articles with balanced analysis every week. reading this magazine ensures that i know what is happening worldwide every week although i do not always agree with some positions the magazine takes. this is recommended reading for business leaders and decision makers who require a diverse range of views and information about what is happening at different places in the world on subjects as diverse as politics current affairs science and technology national regional and global issues finance trade and development. even great people like nelson mandela relied on this magazine for news during his long years in prison.

" this is the most accurate geo-political and socio-economic english-language news-weekly there is. period. articles are succinct top-notch and cover everything from the world today to business economics to the environment. i do think the magazine tends to focus a bit too little on the environment and religion but that is my perception. despite the editorial style and very sophisticated diction articles are still easy to understand. true this magazine (or newspaper as it calls itself) is staunchly pro-democracy (i.e. broadly speaking anti-russian policy anti-chinese policy in their respective conflicts say over georgia or taiwan and pro-war on the iraq issue) pro-free trade and pro-european (i.e. for the expansion of the eu). but it takes many conservative and liberatarian positions too and oftentimes even liberal ones which overall makes the magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most of the points-of-view after reading just a few articles on the same subject although the economist usually does imply or sometimes downright state which position it takes or the world must take. actually that's the best part: it is very refreshing to have a magazine that is not afraid to share its opinion and offer its advice to readers hence its influence. this for me is the icing on the cake. as an economics and international relations student i have been receiving the economist for some three years already. in that short time span it has been a source -- usually the main source -- of dozens of my essays and country reports (the country or topical surveys published every several weeks are excellent for this!) and reading the magazine has increased my english vocabulary significantly. i finally feel that my vocabulary has increased from third-grade level to college-level. yes it does indeed take a few weeks to get used to the unique writing style but the magazine is indispensible. to some it may appear arrogant which is what i tend to sense at times but that does not mean it is a bad magazine. quite simply it tends to think of itself as sophisticated and rightfully so. while half-owned by the financial times many of the economist's authors also write for the latter which can help explain while the two are similar. but while the financial times is a daily newspaper with fairly brief articles and a 50-50 slant on news and finance/business the economist's articles while also succinct focus on everything in the world that impacts people. and that is why it's an excellent summary of the world this week for those people with little time on their hands. finally i do not necessarily sense an anti-semitic slant as stated in one previous review. yes i am jewish but i tend to regard the economist's proposed solutions -- such as dealing with hamas politically (despite their militancy) as they cannot be destroyed -- to of the middle east conflict as mere pragmatism at work. the same with its proposal to legalize various drugs. not that both of these things will ever happen in today's world (the mid-east conflict won't end; drugs won't be decriminalized in most countries) but the thinking is purely pragmatic which is refreshing for a world so increasingly bent on political correctness. in this respect as in the aforementioned ones i feel the magazine is a lot more objective overall than many others despite the specific positions it takes in particular articles. it makes for a truly fascinating read. it is most surely the investment it claims to be so for any of those with any remaining doubts the $129 subscription price ($77 for students) is more than worth it. just read three or four issues and you'll see. trust me ",positive
" the economist has to be the best weekly magazine for current events. whether you are conservative or liberal you will appreciate the well thought out and reasoned essays that this magazine has to offer. i don't think this will end up swaying people's political opinions too much but it will at least provide an informed opinion. americans know too little about the world around them and this is the perfect tool for fixing that. there are arguments that this magazine swings on both sides of the political fence depending on your views. i have my opinions on this but still love it. the articles i disagree with force me to think and hone my own debates. to compare this magazine with newsweek or time is like comparing a precision automobile with one of those 25 cent rides kids enjoy. sure they make the motions of a car and look like a car but in the end they don't go anywhere and you wasted your money with nothing to show for it. this magazine does more with its short essays than newsweek could ever do with its six-page layouts. too bad there isn't a teen version of this magazine. that would do a lot to rectify america's education problems. i find the argument that some people cite that this magazine has a severe pro-laissez faire bias is ridiculous at best. it is like criticizing auto magazines for having a combustion engine bias. this is a magazine of economics. since laissez faire economics is the basis for just about every single economy in the world they concentrate on it. sorry but marxist and keynesian economic models didn't pan out. maybe if feudilism mounts a come back they might change their focus until then we are stuck with reality.

" most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite. this is the only weekly newsmag i can stand to read and i love to read it. us news is a grab bag of topics international is excellent (vs. other us sources of news) finance & business is excellent science is a grab bag books & arts is quite good and the periodic special reports are great. cheeky and clear a delight to read. bring your skepticism though because the reporters & columnists are not shy about taking a position and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion.

" too often in america we are fed news by deceiving journalists (such as those that work for fox news). the economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to america's. it is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world from politics to economics to science to the arts. best of all the articles (except for the special report) are concise allowing for an easy read. ",positive
" this magazine has great recipies! most of them are incredibly easy but there are a few adventuresome ones every once in a while to try when you feel up to a challenge. sometimes the recipies need a few more spices so i usually add more than they say (heck it doesn't change the calorie count). however cooking light does not trade calories for taste so the whole family likes the meal and there are many recipies that i would proudly serve to company (the majority in fact). there are also just a ton of recipies per issue. the only negative things i would say is that a few of the recipies are only marginally healthy and sometimes there's some redundancy. overall it's a great buy ",positive
" yes - there are tons of great shots in the mag; great articles ( in french only ) contests---very chic....however---- customer service will treat you like the redheaded stepchild when you ask them why have you not sent me the latest issue of photo?? ....and you know it will happen. they only send you sporadic issues when they feel like it ( or so it would seem )... most issues are available on the stand weeks before you get yours delivered via mail ( should it be the other way around??? ) and they wont give you a courtesy letter/postcard telling you when your subscription is up...that's for you to figure out. so if you can deal with the lame french hold music when you call photo's cutomers service constantly this is a great magazine..... cough...cough...vive la france!

" there was a time when i read a lot of magazines. i found there being too much fluff and not enough stuff. i was introduced to fast company in 1997 and have been a subsriber for most if not all of the last 8 years. every issue has relevant topics on the current state of business. it has stayed with a formula that has worked; that business in constantly changing and to reflect back on the past when something has changed that they once wrote on. i heartily recommend this must read to anyone who wants to make a difference in the business world ",positive
" effective with the november 2004 issue gramophone has undergone a number of changes in design and editorial content all for the better. one of these changes perhaps the most minor of all is the reversion to its original title 'the' gramophone. the other changes are more substantial hardly cosmetic especially for north american readers. one of the more notable new features is an article devoted to the event (great musical events in history). for my money gramophone could hardly have done better than to feature the september 12 1910 premire performance of gustav mahler's 8th symphony (the symphony of a thousand according to emil guttmann the promoter engaged by mahler for the premire). if i had just *one* performance to pick were i able to turn the clock back it would unquestionably have been this one. the anonymous writer has done a competent and reasonably accurate and complete job recapturing the excitement of an event which was talked about for decades afterward by those who were there. another new feature is titled the experts' expert in which well-known musicians of today talk about their own historical favorites for their instrument(s). for the november 2004 issue several famous violinists (plus lara st. john who falls into a different category entirely) praise their personal heroes. while not unanimous it is telling that anne-sophie mutter sarah chang julia fischer and two others identify david oistrakh as their personal inspiration. still a third new feature gramophone classics is a roundtable discussion of historic performances (one each month) by the gramophone reviewers. for this kick-off month the historic performance is that of the complete cycle of dvorak symphonies by the late istvn kertsz and the london symphony orchestra. now nearly forty years old this is a boxed set of the cycle that i had favorably reviewed myself quite some time back. (interestingly a nice photograph of kertsz conducting the lso shows that [at least] the principal flutist was playing a wooden flute an advantage usually conceded to czech musicians over their counterparts elsewhere in performing dvorak's symphonies.) the balance of gramophone aside from minor cosmetic layout changes is pretty much as it had been in recent years. there is the usual north american supplement/insert covering events performers and releases specific to this market; this is the version american subscribers receive and which is available in american book and magazine stores. the monthly reviews section is always of interest because it includes reviews of releases often available in the u.k. (and the continent) before they are available domestically. there is the obligatory free cd that includes excerpts from the editors' choice of best discs of the month (something which i tend to ignore if only because excerpts can only give an incomplete picture of matters). and finally always of interest to this semi-gearhead are the audio equipment reviews if only to point out the differences between american and british gearheads. :-) the main purpose of such a publication is of course to provide critical commentary on new classical music releases. in this respect i find the u.s.-published fanfare to be a more reliable source of information than the u.k.-published gramophone. chalk it up to across the pond differences in both repertoire and opinion if you like. nevertheless the improvements that take us from gramophone to the gramophone are enough for me to bump what might have been a 3-star review to one that is a solid 4 stars. bob zeidle ",positive

" this magazine is devoted to american inventions and technology that have affected our lives. in essence this magazine is a historical magazine about american technology. within each issue are multiple articles about a historical invention. the articles can either focus on the technology or focus on an individual who has been a key contributor to the advancement of that technology. typically each issue also has an interview with an inventor or inventors whose contributions have materially affected our lives or society. the scope of the magazine is broad. there have been articles on the trans-canada highway. another recent issue had an excellent article on tunnel boring machines. in yet another article the development of refinery cracking was described in the context of the development of higher performance engines. the contribution of high octane gasoline to the winning of the air war was mentioned an interesting piece of trivia of which i was previously unaware. the scope of the magazine is beyond the physical sciences. biology and the development of medical technology are also covered. while the magazine is written at a level that an educated non-expert can understand some of the biology related articles challenge my attention. this magazine is an excellent source of technological history. however while the technical jargon used is that appropriate to a technology this magazine is not light reading for those unfamiliar with a specific field. as an example i had to read portions of the article on refinery cracking a couple of times to understand the general description of how the cracking process works. therefore while i highly recommend this magazine to anyone with an interest in the history of technology realize that for some readers for example elementary school students this magazine could present a reading challenge. most articles also provide pictures or other artwork. frequently this artwork is unavailable from any other magazine source because there are so few magazines that deal with technological history. the quality of the images varies because many of the pictures have not been well-preserved but in many cases they are the only pictures available. this magazine frequently mentions the inventor's hall of fame in akron ohio which is sponsored by the united states patent & trademark office. a number of articles have covered inductees to the inventor's hall of fame showing that while the articles are historical in nature they are also currently relevant. there are a large number of magazines that are either about technology or have had articles about technology. there are a large number of trade magazines that cover technology. sometimes these magazines even have articles about the history of an invention. however the american heritage of invention & technology is the only magazine of which i am aware the covers the history of invention and technology. while the focus of the articles is american technology it is inevitable that the relationship of foreign invention is covered occasionally as well when that technology was important in the development of american technology. i consider this magazine to be excellent for anyone with an interest in historical technology and is an excellent complement to other historical magazines.

" i wish this magazine came out more often (as another reviewer said). it would be fascinating for anyone with the slightest interest in the history of technology and engineering. recent articles have covered vacuum tubes their history and why some are still used now and nuclear power and how that industry stalled in america. i remember reading another article in the mid-'90s about a guy in new york city who shoveled coal for a public school furnace. he explained his job and how hard it was to buy a coal shovel (the hardware store people couldn't believe it). a few years later they followed up with a note that all public schools in nyc had been converted from coal and that the coal-shoveler's job was much easier maintaining the new furnace. stories on iron bridges and how necco wafers are made (with the same machine for 100 years or so) and how buttons are made from seashells and how paper clips are made and how a hollywood actress designed a frequency-jumping weapons guidance system and all sorts of others are included. lots of cool articles about how everyday (and not-so-common) technologies went from ideas in someone's mind to products that are ready for use ",positive

" first i received this subscription as a gift for the holidays and can say that it is the gift that just gives and gives and gives. this magazine has been a wonderful source of ideas for in the kitchen on the grill around the house in my garden in the state as well as all through the south for traveling. being a woman who moved from the detroit suburbs to florida so i could be with ailing family i was really a duck out of my elements. i had no idea of what was where within the state; what are good places to visit where are some of the great attractions outside of orlando the keys and the everglades and who does what where. in this magazine there are sections devoted just to florida (which i suspect they do for each state per subscription) -- what to plant when what festivals are going on what's hot and what's not - a whole derth of information devoted just to the state i live in. and that's not all... not only do i get to learn more about where i am today i can explore and learn about where i'd like to go tomorrow. one month it's welcome to alabama and all the wonderful gems it has to offer. another month i am poring over beautiful georgia. a different topic? seafood of the south. how would you like to learn about fantasic but yet unknown places for bargains and great finds? now - i am also an avid cook at home - and i cannot tell you how much i love to read through and try/improvise on all the de-lish recipes found each month closer to the back of the magazine. how many differnt ways have i learned to make potato salad alone is worth the cost of admission! i have learned so much more about grilling vegetable side dishes breakfast treats and savories from all over the south tempting lip-smacking desserts - and everything in between. i have always known the south was the jewel of the states when it came to cooking - but w.o.w! so much history and fun can be shared whether it be in the kitchen or on the grill. and it is a great compliment to what i learn from other books the food channel and beyond. it speaks to where i live what i can get down here and what the heck plantains are anyway :-) i love looking through many of the decorating ideas the travel tips and vignettes of different states or towns or themes. the only reason this magazine does not get a 5 from me is that it sometimes caters/addresses a crowd which can afford more than i can in the way of travel decorating etc. i am more simple down-to-earth folk and do not share much with decorating your summer cottage or what to do with that spare $ thousand plus dollars on a cruise or splurge excursion. sometimes and since they are not making this magazine specifically for me i am not going to be able to relate to everything i am not the crowd they are talking to. otherwise this magazine is a 10 in my book :-) well worth the money - but even more so - the anticipation of next month's explorations ",positive
" this publication is in my opinion the most intelligent funny and readable magazine about pc games available. it blows the competition offered up by the u.s. magazines out of the water. you get: *a dual-sided dvd loaded with demos movies screenshots podcasts games mods patches and compiled archives of games and hardware recommendations to view from your pc *humor which obliterates the drivel attempted by the us version. *lots of material- it's thick and the pages are much bigger in size. you feel like you're getting a real magazine rather then a flimsy cheap catalogue of advertisements. *quality- both in the writing and physically. there are loads of articles with good insight into the industry every month. they are given lots of space and feel very scholarly to read. the pages are of good quality paper and the ink is crisp and clear and is easy to read. pick up a copy of this from a shop like barnes and nobles sometime to see what it's like. i guarantee you'll be impressed especially if you're used to the gaming fare we get served this side of the pond ",positive

" people is the most incredible magazine. the writers of the magazine know exactly what you want to read as a subscriber but there will always be an extra section that just does not interest you because no magazine can attract every ones personal interests. no matter what this magazine always makes friday a great day. i feel the best part about people magazine is the fact that they give you special issues like 50 most beautiful people sexiest man alive and eligible bachelor. you get a variety highlights in each people issue. you will find inside each issue many sections pertaining to your interest. a section called the mailbox where you get to read other people responses to the articles in the last issue released. the passage page where they will give you all the details of celebrities such as marriages births divorces deaths injured or convicted. finally i love getting toward the end of the magazine just to be able to read the true crime stories because they are intriguing and quite interesting. the only bad part about people magazine is that most people just like myself buy the issues to read about celebrities. but you also get the human interest stories which don't seem to interest everyone. now i do not have a subscription but i read every issue whether i buy them myself or read the magazine at work. i would say that if you wanted to purchase a magazine this would be a great one to choose because the magazine reaches out to any one in their teenage years and up ",positive

" this subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed' cd because some chump has stolen it before you could. this rock music magazine is superior to others on the market in my opinion because it has excellent production values i.e. luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions. as a bonus the writing is superior and highly imaginative. an expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched. i like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band. in addition this magazine covers us and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the usa as they are in uk; often these are bands that we might want to know better. the reviews section is always great and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g. 'best r&amp;b albums from the 1970's in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists. this magazine will have you finding buying and liking albums by bands you've never heard of and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price ",positive
" discipleship journal does what many other christian magazines do not do. it provides instruction and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a christ-focused faith. while others may talk about christianity dj asks you to pursue christ through responding to scripture. this isn't an evangelistic magazine like decision or an encouraging magazine per se like moody. it is for the christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what god's word says. it is not for the passive pew sitter. this for the christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between sundays. there is nothing watered-down here. it is published by navpress who like their counterparts the college ministry navigators know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday christian. whether it is a discussion about satan's favorite lies how to study a particular book of the bible or an explanation of what prayer is an is not dj is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our lord and his ways. this is a great tool for two or three people to use together. even a small group... to go through the articles week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life. i've even heard of ccd and sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week's class. i fully recommend discipleship journal. expect your faith to grow. anthony trendl editor hungarianbookstore.co ",positive

" i've had subscriptions to just about every woman's magazine there is over the past 8 years but the only one i always renew is glamour. it's less how-to-catch-a-man oriented than cosmo less pseudo-hipster than jane and less serious than marie claire. while it's certainly no ms. magazine it has a lot of women-positive messages every issue articles that aren't as sensationalistic and fear-mongering than most found in women's magazines and lots of fashion and beauty tips. i feel that glamour strikes the right balance between frivolity and seriousness--for those of you who like a side of third-wave feminism with your fashion i highly recommend it.

" kiplinger's personal finance is a worthy challenge to money magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends helpful financial tips and - in kpf's case - a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor. i came to kpf by way of the well-read hand-me-downs of one of kiplinger letters (for which see elsewhere on [...]) that were pressed into my hands by my mother-in-law 25 years ago. she probably thought that without i'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion. i eventually migrated up the kiplinger food chain to the glossier kpf and have never left. much of the information provided by kpf (mutual fund and etf results and the liek) are widely available. the same could be said of the investing advice (look for no-loads with low fees diversify don't bail under pressure). where kpf excels is in the short articles and tips which have often prodded me to take money- and/or sanity-saving moves. two fine recent examples: the articles in the september 2006 issue entitled 'buy a 2006 car on sale?' and '5 things to ask about silk ties'. both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions i'm likely to make in the new year. what's more the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably *not* the ones you'd anticipate. in terms of marco-economic instincts the kiplinger washington editors run bullish though not quite so much as money's more cosmopolitan-posed writers. kpf won't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman's toys either a fact that is well observed by their authors who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or german auto makers. don't get me wrong i read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about kpf if it were my only source. but kpf's monthly arrival is still always welcomed as it has been for years. it remains firmly entrenched in my top tier ",positive

" my retirement plan sends me a magazine which is so boring that i don't even bother to open it anymore; kiplinger's isn't at all like that. the best part of kiplinger's is that it describes how real people with average salaries kids and debts can invest for the future. there are also some great articles for parents about how to teach their kids to manage their money. everything seems practical but i've yet to try any of it. the magazine is broken into four sections: `ahead' short articles about finance news and current event `investing' about investing mostly stocks `your money' about ways to invest your money though not as technical as the investing section and more diverse and `spending' which is basically general interest about new fun technologies and other ways to spend all the money saved or made through investing ",positive
" kiplinger's personal finance magazine fits right in the middle between the lowest-common denominator approach of money magazine and the head-in-the-clouds attitude at worth magazine. kiplinger's has a nicely balanced style and tone; it never preaches and i almost always find a tip suggestion or tax-saving idea that pays for my year's subscription in every single issue. if that's the measure of the value of a personal finance magazine then kiplinger's personal finance magazine deserves a five-star rating. good stuff and a good value ",positive
" i've read other personal finance magazines before and found them to be either too basic to be worth my time or too focused on some obscure area. i'm not a financial professional but i like to constantly increase my knowledge of personal finance. kiplinger's has been great for that. i skip 80% of the articles in this magazine but that still leaves one or two in every issue that teach me about an area i didn't know about -- where to buy bonds online the most cheaply how to find good financial advice why options are priced the way they are. one good article pays for the entire annual subscription. each issue has a wide range of articles appealing to lots of levels of experience ",positive

" my only gripe with this magazine is that the pictures are like those you would find in gq magazine: they hire models to show you driving a nail or shoveling dirt for that new patio. these people use only brand new tools (brand name label showing of course) in a perfect-world dust free environment. the pictures make it look like it's a sears catalogue. aside from that the articles are great making it one of the best magazines for the do-it-yourselfer. i have saved more money from the tips in this magazine than any other magazine i subscribe to. most articles can be done by any semi-skilled craftsman with access to a decent set of tools making it an approachable magazine for the diy'er. i highly recedommend this magazine in conjunction with fine homebuilding magazine. in that magazine you will find that the pictures are of real people operating used tools in a real environment. the articles in handyman are a bit more down-to-earth but together you will get the most benefit ",positive
" this is one of the best sources for ideas on home improvement. beyond the great ideas they also give you detailed directions on projects along with a good number of pictures. i have learned how to do a great number of things i used to hire others to do because i thought i didn't have the skills - they make most projects around the house seem accessible but not by oversimplifying the process. some may argue that they give too much detail but this is essential for anyone new to a project and can be breezed through for those that are more experienced. the only downside is that they give you ideas for things you never knew you needed!

" what i like about this magazine is that it does not focus on mainstream attractions and destinations. it tries to go off the beaten path and provides many suggestions of places to visit restaurants to eat at and even specific places to shop. not only that on every issue they have a list of awesome travel tips provided by travelers. in addition they list great travel specials and the corresponding websites. i've been a subscriber for approximately 6 months and i have to say that i enjoy this magazine.

" this magazine has beautiful pictures heartwarming stories and as a bonus a laugh or two. it covers the countryside of all of the united states and reminds you of a slower more genteel time. it makes you want to plan a trip to view the scenery for yourself. if you long for life outside of the city you'll enjoy this obvious labor of love ",positive
" asimov's provides 11 issues annually packed with science fiction novellas novelettes short stories poems book reviews and editorial articles. as with any anthology or anthology-magazine the story quality varies but there are some true gems. alan m. steele wrote a series of stories for asimov's beginning with the wonderful stealing alabama and including the stunning the days between. these stories were later combined in the novel coyote. one value of this magazine is to introduce readers to authors they do not know. several years ago george r. r. martin wrote a short story for asimov's that i found enthralling. it turned out to be a portion of martin's then-upcoming novel a game of thrones which is in itself the first in a series of books (now going on four rumored to be seven overall) called a song of ice and fire and that is probably my all-time favorite fantasy series. overall asimov's is a science fiction buffet; you get a little taste of everything some of it good (kage baker's company series) some of it great (martin's and steele's above-mentioned stories) and some of it that you take a bite and leave the rest for the bus-boy (i don't care for elliot fintushels' izzy series) ",positive

" i am not a big magazine reader -- never have been never really had time to! however a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read...after falling in love every time read it i finally i had to get a subscription of my own! this magazine covers everything! it's got tips for life cooking decorating organzing and getting the best deal for your money. a lot of the stuff in here -- shortcut cooking ideas for instance are stuff that i use and apply to my normal life. for example: the july 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler. the result of that recipe was a wonderful dessert for my family of four that took me... less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great! they don't endorse products nearly to the same degree that most magazines do and when they do it's in an article where they had comparisons done...always a recommendation and usually more than one. the important thing here is they don't say buy this product they say buy products that have such and such feature make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair and oh here's an example of what we're talking about. they make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme. so in conclusion if you're like me and can use a few extra ideas about everything in your life...this is a great magazine. the information is helpful applicable to normal everyday life...and it's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers ",positive
" i just wanted to comment on some of the other reviews that are posted here. many try to sterotype the type of readers who like real simple well i love this magazine- and didn't manage to fit into any of there categories. my aunt sent me this magazine and then i began to read it monthly i enjoy the tips and sections like no time to clean? quick solutions for every room- yes they do have product suggestions but much of the information that is provided can be done with things you already have. others have called this magazine- a slave to fashion as a woman in her 20's i would say this magazine is the one that contains minimal clothing information. overall i enjoy this magazine as others have mentioned the recipes are great and i always find plenty of good tips. the photography and layout are amazing i always use the old editions for reference or crafts ",positive
" my mother bought me a gift subscription when i moved in to my first apartment. i love this magazine. i pass the recipies on to family and friends who have enjoyed them as well. the simple solutions to everyday needs are extremely helpful and well worth the $30 or so for a subscription. i am buying it for a housewarming present for a friend this week.

" ...and while yes i've made comments in the past about how oprah has changed a little this is about a publication. i'm sure that the person who wrote that this is just another magazine full of things one can't afford reads fashion or celebrity magazines full of many things she can't afford. advertising generates money and while i don't like ads either they are everywhere because advertising works. if you don't want to see them don't buy magazines watch tv or go anywhere. as far as the layouts being too full of clutter ...everyone has their own style. there are some people who like that look and don't prefer a pared-down zen look. magazines are not about reality. if they were they wouldn't be plastered with plastic bronzed 6' females who weigh 100 lbs. i'm originally from middle america and nobody looks like that there. just take magazines and ads for what they are. save your money like i do for things you just have to have. if you don't have the perserverence to do that then stick to the target and walmart circulars. the knock-offs are never far behind.

" first off most people don't buy this magazine in order to salivate over what they don't have but desperately want--at least i don't. this magazine is a wonderful inspiration for those of us who are interested in making the most of our home and free time. isn't our home supposed to be a haven? someplace to return to from the hustle bustle and craziness of the day and just relax and spend time making memories and creating joy in our lives and of those we love. this magazine simply caters to people with that ethic. it's always full of ideas--both trendy and traditional. it's not full of buy buy buy! hyper-consumerist propoganda--it simply presents current trends and new ideas to keep your haven fresh and fun. anyone with a lick of sense and an ounce of self-respect doesn't turn to home magazines looking to be led like a sheep into the latest buying frenzy. most of us are smart enough to flip through the pages and get ideas of things we like and then find clever inexpensive ways to incorporate them into our own lives--on our own budget. this magazine is always full of beautiful pictures great advice and even terrific information about how and where to find bargains. mainly though it's about making the most of what you've got and using your free-time to truly enjoy life to its fullest. don't fall for the neosocialist rhetoric of the first review. this magazine is worth every penny ",positive
" i have been a regular subscriber of sci fi mags for just about the past 15 yrs or so. it all began with omni and when omni folded i found a a copy of science fiction age. i had been subscribed to it for about 2 years before it folded. i found a few omni-like glossy mag twins thereafter but they all folded as well. finally i found the magazine of fantasy and science fiction and analog and have been consistently subscribed to other for the past 10 yrs. both of the latter are outstanding 'zines but for me analog is the best because it satisfies the craving for hard sci fi and *fact* at the same time. if f&sf & analog ever have to close up shop then i would hope they would merge because then i'd have my hard sci fi fact *and* horror/fantasy all in a one stop shop.

" ok. for those of you who continue to believe that new york is the center of the united states hell the world who forgot the map cnn kept flashing with the two different colors after the election that might infer there are several schools of thought about the polycentric views of the us for those of you who can take a little criticism from the midwest the dark states middle earth the elba of the 21st century you're not. there's a whole world out here. people have jobs. yes it's true. we work send our kids to school even go to church on sundays. and on other days too. we vote. oh yeah you already know that. so having an interview with an actor who goes on about how he meditates is a vegan and thinks about trees and birds when he has a particularly stressful scene with ashley or uma or diane you know it just doesn't carry a lot of weight with the serfs. but . . . . it's a great magazine. andy lives. photography is tight and realistic. the ads are sexy and provocative. the sidebars interesting and insightful. it's wordly. it covers music as well as rs. it's (don't get all riled up now) a fun magazine to read. however the interviews which we are led to believe are the heart and soul of the magazine seem to be along the lines of 'damn it's so good to be me and i guess you're ok too.' or 'i see you're wearing a $15000 versace with a plunging neckline and . . . you've selected old black converse all stars to wear with it! how noveau! how tasteful!' come on. where's the bite? where's the interview with alex rodriguez that says 'how come you went to therapy . . . it's only new york?' or with marv alpert 'hey what's on your fashion agenda now?' chris berman from espn says he was on maui a couple of years back and he was walking with his kids one dawn and he ran into steven stills with his kids. now that's a conversation i would have liked to hear not one that ends up with me thinking the two parties to the conversation (it sure isn't an interview - see columbia university's interviewing 101 in their school of journalism) are off to pick out furniture. it's new york. show your teeth. flex. 5 stars. larry scantlebury ",positive

" okay it's not one of the fancy traditional mags but i found loads of things that generated ideas. the sections showing design elements carried through the house were my favorites. it may be on the advertising end of the spectrum in some regards but i liked seeing similar (but different) approaches to the same design goal by various manufacturers. having all the web addresses made it easy for me to follow-up on designs i liked and i didn't have to worry that the editors were trying to curry favor with their advertisers by pontificating on the merits of one item over another. i'm a visual learner and this fit the bill. unlike another reviewer who would suggest that this is due to my gender i think that people respond differently to the same presentation of material. don't write this off because it's not a marquee magazine--try it first. you might just like it. and by the way i do read and like magazines and books that have no pictures too ",positive
" this is a magazine i frequently get confused with foreign affairs magazine. the primary difference is the longer well-written essays by leading experts in affairs whereas foreign policy has a more frequently published more up to date and more direct version of the other. it would be great to have both since policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail. if you don't have a lot of time to read policy is the one you'll need and enjoy.

" when i was little my dad always said good things about this magazine. my attitude was always &quot;i'm not gonna buy a magazine to bore myself some more&quot; - i mean c'mon it's a history magazine. i was absolutely wrong. i picked up this magazine one day and i was hooked. i would say that american heritage has found its way to make history interesting. one way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest (as subtle as they may be) into its articles. on the second thought i should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not. this magazine keeps me awake - sometimes i would put my paper/project aside just so that i could finish my copy in one sitting. it's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months. american heritage makes history grrreattt! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20's like myself ",positive

" there are a few magazines about writing serious writers need to read. poets & writers is one of them. it has a literary bent but avoids the nose-in-the-air attitude. it is practical and educational and is pleasingly presented. a favorite factor for me are the long feature articles on the culture of writing. in the issue out now there are two major articles. one is about author stuart dybek and his fiction that pulls from his experience growing up on chicago's colorful south side. the other is about writing contests dealing with how ethical they are run the view of literary judges and when a writer should considering entering one. the secondary articles are as informative and as useful whether you want to learn about promoting your book doing online workshops or understand the trends driving the industry. contests incidentally are a big part of pw's value. the magazine tells you who won and which contests/grants are currently accepting submissions. pw is careful to screen which contests are listed ensuring only legitimate ones make it through the editors. the writing itself is interesting. it is not always true that writing magazines are fun to read. it should be and in the case of pw everything is engaging. pw's design is clean. it looks like what a small press literary magazine should look like. the typography and layout are not pretentious or overbearing but get the job done. it is never work to read this magazine. i fully recommend poets & writers. you will be better informed about writing and writers just like the titles implies. anthony trendl editor hungarianbookstore.co ",positive

(see side glances by peter egan) -the occasional technology-related feature. -classic cars classic drivers classic tracks. the best historical content in the business. -very little content on suvs. (a positive in my book) the competitors: car and driver has substantially more road tests and previews and some good specialty features on a pretty regular basis but hardly anything on racing and history. frankly motor trend isn't anything to write home about. the articles are shorter and less captivating they can't seem to settle on a design theme and they also have a lack of racing and historical content. if i had to pick just one road & track would definitely be my choice.

" lieven's article &quot;in the mirror of europe: the perils of american nationalism&quot;;is succinct cogent and in my opinion frighteningly accurate. my experience as a professor convinces me that we are in the midst of a nationalistic arrogance whipped by endlessly reptetiive mantras including 9/11 war on terrorism and god which the majority of my students now accept as truth. i have one suggestion i think mr. lieven is overly optimistic when he comments that the neoconservative empire-builders are not yet the majority in positions of power. i feel their reach inlcudes the legislative and executive branch much of the leadership of coporate america an increasing number of jewish and christian denominations much of the media-particularly am talk radio higher education the military and with another four years of the current administration federal courts at all levels. i will bring up this article in many of my discussion groups. i think the article was well-written and important my congratulations to the author ",positive

" as a subscriber to martha stewarts magazines i have to admit this has become my favorite simply because its concise and interesting to boot. love the week end dinner section as well as the recipe index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when i am looking for something quick to consider fixing but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine. some of the other regular features that i like and find helpful are the cooking for one section since as a widow i hate wasting food and know of many other singles who want to eat healthy but need some ideas. also like the wine basics section which has enlightened me on new wines that i now like trying. in season is a great section because it reminds the reader what is in season which makes shopping and cooking easier. the size of the magazine is nice because it slips easily into my pocket so i can recheck it while shopping to see what items i have highlighted to pick up. this is also a great magazine for couples singles of all ages which is refreshing since so many magazines are geared to upper middle class 2.5 children homes. and... the magazine seems to improve with each new issue ",positive
" i have been getting this magazine for a year now. i have a few new favorites i make on a regular basis. the pictures are pretty. the prep times have been accurate for my cooking speed. the ingredients are all easy to find in my local grocery store. there is detailed nutrition info available for the dieters. so if you are looking for some nice new things to make this is a great way to find them.

" outdoor photographer is the essential how-to and where-to magazine for the outdoor photographer. i would recommend it for all levels of photographic skill although most discussions of technique are suited to intermediate to advanced skill levels. there is only occasional discussion of the most basic techniques as would benefit beginners. there are however so many great ideas on where and what to photograph that i think beginners can get a lot out of the magazine as well. and you won't be a beginner for long. the outdoor in the title does not refer exclusively to nature photography. most of the magazine is dedicated to nature photographybut there are frequent articles on travel location and other sorts of outdoor photography as well. in outdoor photographer you will find how-to articles on lighting exposure filters gear preparing yourself and your gear for the elements -be they arctic cold or rain forest heat and humidity along with some advice specifically for digital cameras and the digital darkroom. and you will find this information for everything from close-up to landscape photography. outdoor photographer focuses primarily on 35 mm and digital photography with an occasional article on medium format. the discussions of exposure lighting and locations are applicable to all formats of photography however. and there is george lepp's monthly question and answer column for those questions on just about any photographic or digital imaging subject that are not answered elsewhere. and now for the best part. outdoor photographer tells you where to get great outdoor photographs. favorite places is a one-page feature in every issue that tells you about a great place in the united states to photograph what there is to see and what time of the year is best. be sure to save those in case you ever have the time and means to visit them all. in addition to favorite places there are featured articles in every issue that detail a place to photograph how to get there what to take what to photograph etc. frequently written by well-known nature photographers and accompanied by some of their terrific photographs. i counted 3 such articles in the last issue of op that i received. if you are a photographer or hobbiest who is able to travel a lot outdoor photographer is a terrific bargain just for the locations. and if you don't travel much it will help you photograph your backyard and local parks and gardens well ",positive

" in the years i have taken this magazine i have noted that often covered material becomes tomorrow's news from the latest hot-spot in the world. so prescient it is eery - if you have any interest in current events news or foreign affairs this journal is a must read. the contributors are a who's who of politics science and business in the world. often the author list will become the under-secretary of state list in the next administration. for example the last issue discussed avian flu virus. as a physician i can tell you that these were excellent informative articles that explained clearly what was happening and what the danger was. and now this stuff is on tv every day and i can amaze my patients with how much i know about the issue that no one else does. reading this will definitely make you look smart. try this experiment and see if i'm right. this article is written in october 2005 days after receiving the october issue with multiple articles about china written by chinese authors. of course that means that these articles aren't really useful for facts so much as they are useful for seeing what china wants us to believe. i predict that china will be much more in the news in the next 6 to 12 months. so put this magazine to the test and see. one negative is that although the authors are bi-partisan regarding party they are not conservative. you won't ever find pro-tariff anti illegal immigration isolationist anti judicial activism or pro-life articles in here. indeed regardless of which party an author supports you can pretty much count on expanded government especially one-world government presented as the solution. and lastly some of the articles are deadly boring and contain stilted obfuscated diplomatic jargon. you will rarely find a simple eloquent phrase but you will often find ideas that will pop up in any analysis of the news. just realize many of these authors are diplomats and politicians whose careers depend on obfuscation and plausible deniability. all in all this is an extremely influential journal that is full of cutting-edge ideas. just realize that many of them may be wrong ",positive

" my initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge and full of ads. i also read vogue though and to be honest w has less ads in it. w convieniently avoids the snotty air of harper's bazaar and vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in cosmopolitan redbook and marie claire and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of instyle. this magazine has excellent layouts and from what i've read thus far excellent-and very different-stories. as a regular vogue reader i'm used to reading about older designers like coco chanel the versace and prada lines and reading about a small smattering of socialites like aerin lauder paris hilton jemma kidd victoria traina. what is different about w is that it profiles the new and the modern. an article in the september issue profiled kate spade and her new line. other articles talked almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites meanwhile talking about in an article aptly titled a bag called it the trend of statement purses and their proper place. w is also similar to vogue that in addition to the good layouts it has even better photography there are no photoshopped to death photos in here and if they are this student can't find them. what i like most about w is its sarcastic wit something that is lost in most magazines many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man worship teri hatcher or read dumbed down articles.

" this is a light and colorful newspaper. i remember when it first came out .the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole. it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country. the reporting itself is clear and very readable. the paper lacks weight and depth. it has a lot of variety in its features and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable. it's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting. and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers.

" one of the funniest magazines around. in a recent article the weekly standard proposed massively expanding the irs to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit. which group did the weekly standard say should be targeted for this increased irs presence (and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100%)? the entertainment industry. the reality tv show contestants the teen-pop singers and the like. the article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry but with all the people that really want fame that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame the industry would continue along (i'm curious if o'rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers). another o'rourke article provided the readers with an alternate inaugural address by bush (subtitle: what if george w. bush weren't a compassionate conservative . . .; quote: the media say that i won the election on the strength of moral values. if the other fellow had become president would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values?). in all seriousness this magazine is a very clear detailed neo-conservative look at the issues (neo-con? - interestingly it would appear that many of the writers used to be liberals). the magazine does not always present just the conservative perspective and does not always agree with bush. another recent article was by a current liberal ex-communist british writer and his reaction to george galloway's testimony before the us senate. an editorial in that recent issue was all about the dictator in uzbekistan an us ally in the war on terror. the editorial notes that toleration of this dictator and his brutality will undermine bush's current foreign policy. it should be noted that the magazine does not seem to have journalists and few staff writers most appear to be called contributing editors. it is jarring though when i read the magazine then read articles in some of my other subscriptions. variety and weekly standard rarely agree. for that matter i'm somewhat surprised by how often the weekly standard and business week disagree. - michael s. briggs - ",positive

" harper's like the atlantic and the new yorker is written for those looking for more in-depth analysis and coverage on political and cultural affairs with a sampling of serious literary prose. personally i prefer the atlantic which i read regularly only picking up harper's when i have time and something in it interests me which is usually two or three times a year. just looking at the cover and pages inside convey harper's as a serious tome perhaps too serious for the casual reader especially compared to the more colorful pages of the atlantic and playful new yorker cartoons. nevertheless harper's is an american icon in it's genre having published many articles from great names since it's inception in 1850. a number of reviewers complain about it being left leaning and that stance clearly sprouts from the now recently departed editor lewis lapham who has been an outspoken critic of the current administration. mr. lapham shares his views in a two page opinion piece and in the full page listing of various fun facts known as the harper's index. serious readers will be able to get beyond this as simply a viewpoint and see the entire magazine for the serious writing that it is. i would contend this represents the best in critical analysis rather than bias. i would also simply suggest you view the other reviews made by people espousing this periodical as overly biased. for instance at least one of those claiming liberal bias here is also praising an ann coulter book. so if you feel underwhelmed by the typical content you get even in a 60 minute broadcast or a political round table free-for-all and you're interested enough in this magazine to read it's reviews you should probably pick up a copy of it for two or three months and give it a try. i recommend you also check out the new yorker and the atlantic to compare ",positive
" harper's has been in business since 1850 and has published some of the greatest american- writers from mark twain on down. its editor and tone- setter is the veteran journalist lewis lapham. it publishes fiction and articles including interesting symposia on many aspects of american economic political and cultural life. it attracts the big - names in all areas and also provides a lot of human - interest material statistical curiosities historical information and stories. for some reason which i do not fully understand it has never been my great favorite. and in the old days i preferred 'the atlantic' and the 'saturday review of literature ' to it. of course one of the features of 'harper's is its book- reviews done by among others today john leonard. i suppose what has soured me a bit on 'harper's' is its bias to the political left. but that withstanding it still provides a rich mix of articles of high quality ",positive
" i grew up reading fangoria when i could sneak it past my parents that is. fangoria magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article. now you are not always going to agree with everything they say but you can always expect them to be honest. when a horror icon is not performing up to snuff like stephen king or john carpenter they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws. fangoria also has the chainsaw awards where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie actor ect and you can also submit a name for horror hall of fame (my guy has yet to win it). they also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people; like the japanese and italian horrors (wow they can make some splatter flicks) and more independent films that wouldn't be showing at the mainstream theater. and they have pictures. all the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color (though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s). this is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan i whole heartedly recomend it ",positive

" the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends. the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic. it is one of two magazines i subscribe to (the other being the new yorker.) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you. it is not gourmet or martha stewart (not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice ",positive

" when weird tales was revived around 1988 i was sorely disappointed in the direction the editorial staff had taken. it was too progressive and not enough like the old wt so many of us afficionados knew and loved. lin carter had a great thing going for the four paperback issues he came out with under the zebra imprint in the early 1980's. unfortunately he was not allowed to continue. his idea was to keep the flavor of the old weird tales alive and he did it very well. then several years later along comes the the schweitzer/scithers/betancourt wt and my goodness it was sad to see the aura gone. gradually though wt has seemed to come along and put itself somewhat more in the direction of the old-fashioned 'zine it was in its heyday (1920's-1930's) although the editor darrell schweitzer would probably disagree with this observation. anyway wt sports great covers now good stories and good book reviews and interesting editorials. i must say i miss s.t. joshi's always very entertaining book reviews but we can't have everything. scott connors' forthcoming reviews will surely entertain as do douglas winter's. all fantasy lovers should buy this magazine to support the cause of fantastic literature especially the dark fantastic; there are so few outlets of this kind now that whispers and weirdbook not to mention the long gone forgotten fantasy are no longer published. good job mr. schweitzer whether you realize it or not your magazine has become a more cozy old-style aesthetically pleasing magazine more in the true tradition of the original weird tales thanks in no small part to the wonderful covers that have graced it in the last 13 or 14 years ",positive
" i can hardly wait for my next copy to come. i look forward to the magazine more than any other magazine i get and read every word in it. i save them for years and go back to them as they have relevance years back when new books come out. they give me pleasure with every read. even though i can read them on the computer i just love having them around the house so i can pick one up and see what was around months ago or years ago. i'm a real fan. i can't say enough. i've given them as gifts to all of my friends that join audible. i buy books i might not have noticed without reading about it in audiofile. thank you thank you thank you. what more can i say. keep them coming.

" video game magazines have been all the rage in our lives. yet there are just so many of them that tell different stories for different video game systems. that has been the case with one of the biggest-selling ones of all time gamepro. they truly have made it one the most provocative and well in-depth magazines with detail about what games are popular according to their writers and what upcoming games and systems are all in the works. the magazine is quite well but i honestly do wish they could try to publish more in the way of codes and helpful hints for several games for gamecube and game boy advance when most of it primarily focuses in on playstation 2 & xbox. yet gamepro really handles itself as a very deep gamer's magazine. anybody who wants to be enjoy the field of video games this magazine is worth reading. overall: b 1/2 ",positive
" a great magazine for digital camera users from beginner to expert. has great tips and information ",positive
" this magazine is great for beginning to intermediate digital camera users. i think that it is especially great for beginners. there are articles about how to choose the right camera for your purpose and about what all the specifications mean. there are question and answer sections that answer a broad range of questions including how to avoid common computer errors and how to format different digital devices. i like the photo editing tips which explain some of the more elusive aspects of most digital photo editing programs and how to use them. the photo-editing program described most often is adobe photoshop and photoshop elements; however quick advice is also give about how to apply these tips to other programs. for more advanced film camera users there are tips for how to make the same quality image with a digital camera and stories of professional photographers who have switched to digital. however most professional photographers will use macs to edit their photos rather than pcs and more advanced photo editing software. mostly this magazine caters to amateur photographers and the lower end photo-editing programs that are most often used. there are also reviews of new gadgets which are often fun to read and plenty of market place like advertising in the back. this magazine is what it advertises and nothing more ",positive
" this magazine covers every aspect of horror/suspense culture such as comics books music and of course movies. the writers of the articles have respect for the craft involved in the subject and don't just dwell on blood and gore (but have no fear there is plenty of that). whoever designs the layout of this magazine does a beautiful job. lots of glossy photos and intriguing artwork too. give this one a try. i'll bet you'll love it as much as i do ",positive

" i've subscribed to opm for four years now and in that time i've never had any subscription or delivery problems. the writing staff is very intimate with their readers; it's almost like reading a magazine that a bunch of your friends wrote up. the reviews have mostly been spot-on for my tastes (compared to the awful laughable insanity of psm) and even though the ziff-davis crew members are official they are fair. also and this is very very important to me their use of the english language does not suck like it does in psm. the staff at psm seem to be drunk most of the time or maybe they just didn't make it through the second grade i'm not sure - but their mishandling of prose is the main reason i dropped that subscription like a hot potato. opm on the other hand seems to be written by college grads at least and i appreciate that. easy to read filled with thoughtful insight fair reviews and a heaping helping of socially balanced humor opm is bar-none the best playstation magazine you can buy ",positive
" when funds were tight i had a difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions to keep. each women's magazine has a slightly different feel in the writing though with increased competition these styles seem to be in flux. i finally decided that i preferred the writing in bazaar and was getting tired of what i felt was vogue's cosmopolitan attempt to catch a larger readership (if i want to subscribe to cosmo i'll bloody well subscribe). the featured designers are more cutting edge and less mainstream than what is found in vogue. it's a bit snottier (though there are far snottier magazines if you are looking for extreme fashions). among my complaints: bazaar is an obviously thinner magazine and while most of vogue's content is adverts it does seem to have more articles. another item that i find highly irritating is bazaar's society items. i really don't give a ---- who is wearing what at what charity gala especially when i don't play footsies with these people. those complaints aside this is still my favorite fashion magazine ",positive
" before buying a subscription to this magazine i would suggest reading through an issue first just so you are aware of what you'll be getting. no it's not anything particularly challenging or mind-provoking and the articles aren't scholarly or journal-worthy. but.. the articles make the subject accessible to the average reader and do include insights into human behaviors and relationships that are fun and interesting. i am always engaged reading the articles and find them topical and very current unlike some psychology magazines which are too `deep' and drenched in older principles. this is a very `hip' psychology magazine and would be appreciated by those who are not necessarily scholars in the subject but who have a genuine interest in learning more. my favorite part is looking through the recommended books section because there is usually something worthwhile to read ",positive

",positive
" revolver's competing magazines in the heavy metal magazine world are hit parader and circus. i have bought all three of these magazines several times and revolver my final judgement is revolver is the only magazine that is good enough to subscribe to. the other two i still buy occasionally but only for wallpaper (i cut out the pictures of bands in the magazines and hang them in my room.) this magazine is in a way like a combination of circus and blender magazines; it combines the best aspects of both. revolver still has plenty of great pictures but it is also much longer and much better written than circus. it is not quite as long or stuffed full of information as blender but make sure you note that revolver only reports on one genre (heavy metal!) whereas blender could (theoretically) report on every genre (rap pop rock etc.) chances are if a hard rock band (especially a big name hard rock band) is about to or has already released a c.d. revolver will do a story about it. the stories/reports are very entertaining but they also are informative and sometimes a lesson is learned from them. if it's a cover story an interview with the band is also included; if it's not a cover story the writer integrates quotes and answers from the band into the article anyways (even though it's not a formal interview). revolver writers frequently go on tour with a band (i.e. lamb of god). in that case they take the reader backstage on the tour bus and in a concert (with a rundown of the show). when i first started reading this magazine there was a sexual theme to it. there would be a picture of a hot babe in a t-shirt and one side of the poster would be a woman-usually half-naked-in a sexual pose. in the past year or so revolver phased that out (probably to appeal to a broader audience). i sometimes miss the pictures of the hot babes but this way there's more room for real heavy metal pictures. yet even though sex isn't a theme anymore revolver is probably a bit too sophisticated for anyone younger than a teenager. plus there are usually profanities (mainly the f word.) so i would say this magazine is for ages 13 and up. monthly articles: -cover story -3 or 4 other biggish stories - fresh blood column (where a small biography is given on a band you probably haven't heard of) - ask vinnie (an column where readers write questions and pantera/damageplan drummer vinnie paul gives advice) - hard rock news and notes - black and death metal news and notes - in the studio (an update on bands currently recording new music) -free poster (in the middle of the magazine there's a fold-out poster of one or two bands.) the poster isn't very wide but it is about two pages long -free music downloads -ink spot (a story about a musician's favorite tattoo) -favorite sh*t (an interview with a musician with questions such as what's your favorite color?) -joke from a band (revolver has just recently started doing this) - reviews (reviews of c.d.'s music dvd's and video games) pros: --plenty of good pictures and a free poster --professionally written with well known writers (yet it is not too intelligent for teenagers) --edited well (i haven't found any mistakes or typos) -the fresh blood column usually introduces me to a band i haven't heard of but i should probably check out --revolver is accredited and well known enough to be allowed to go on tours with bands and be first for interviews --news columns (on both mainstream and underground metal bands) -the stories are always done with quotes from the band that the report is on --free music! (revolver has started doing a page that gives the reader a password which he/she can then access free music downloads online.) --no stupid questions in interviews (they ask up to date questions and sometimes-i.e. in the interview with puddle of mudd-the writers aren't afraid to ask daring cutting questions) --the in the studio segment is always informative --helpful reliable reviews (they don't automatically praise every heavy metal c.d.) cons: --if you're up to date on your music news web sites the news columns shouldn't really be anything new to you. --not all c.d.'s are reviewed (they give a rundown on the c.d. in the article about the band but c.d.'s from bands that are on the cover of the magazine aren't usually reviewed.) -concerts aren't reviewed -my biggest gripe is that it's only issued once a month. the bottom line is if you're a metalhead this is the best magazine you can get! it is more than well worth the ten dollars you will spend for a years worth of entertainment ",positive
" i first picked up a copy of nylon in chicago while browsing the newsstands. i wasn't sure if i would like it--years of subscribing to vogue elle and some stupid tweeny magazines had almost put me off magazine-reading for good. and yet i always manage to be drawn to the racks. nylon was different from the get go. they always feature unknowns on the cover and when on occassion a well-known celebrity is featured the stories give us a new perspective on them. nylon is worth purchasing for the layout in itself. i could spend hours paging through each feature marveling at the graphics and the way the magazine is put together. i love how they base some of the beauty section on famous movies or bands. nylon also makes a point of covering bands movies and fashion designers that until now have remained obscure. everything they feature is amazing--most of the music they recommend ends up on my amazon wishlist! i would highly recommend nylon to anyone and everyone. this obscure magazine will stun you with its amazing artistic layout and introduce you to new products you may have never discovered ",positive

" as someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier organic way of life i decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter. many did not strike my fancy. for example i found organic style magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste while mind body and spirit fitness seems a little too redundant and doesn't cover natural and organic living at all. natural health however falls somewhere in between covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet natural remedies beauty and food/recipes. as someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy i appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer. though many of the articles do cover ideas and products that aren't entirely natural or organic i still find them to be useful. many items and articles though not all are vegetarian-friendly as well as eco-conscious which i appreciate. one of my few complaints is that the articles can be short sometimes merely glossing over many topics. however if one piques my interest it can be a decent jumping off point to do further research. though i can't compare with the previous version of the magazine that everyone else seems to have preferred as i only began to pick this up at my local whole foods market in the last year i can say that i am impressed with what natural health has to offer it's readers. sure there are several ads plaguing the pages but i still feel as though there are far fewer advertisements than many of the magazines on the shelves today. besides some of the ads have led me to decent products i would not have known of otherwise. furthermore at this price how can anyone really go wrong ",positive

" esquire has gone through a lot of changes over the years. it went from a old style gq clone to a magazine that has broadened its writing reach and content. esquire now occupies a unique nitch in the world of men's magazines. it offers intelligent thoughtful commentary on life music movies and celebrity occasionally good fiction good advice columns a special but brief look at an extraordinary woman in each issue and heartfelt stories on real issues that affect men like an author detailing his battle with cancer. another big bonus esquire is not oversaturated with advertisements when compared to gq and other similar magazines. by comparison to some esquire is about 1/3 the size for the same content. esquire also annually publishes the world's sexiest woman issue. entertaining and well photographed it sets esquire apart because they also chose to celebrate the beauty of women in their 30s 40s and 50s rather than concentrate on the month's latest piece of starlet fluff. at under a dollar an issue esquire is one of the best deals in town and is the perfect non-expensive gift for someone in your life most magazine subscriptions end up costing you an arm and a leg but this price is well worth the content.

" most of the beautiful gardens i see are in washington or oregon or back east somewhere. having lived in washington i do enjoy seeing some of the plants that i am missing here in colorado but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all can't live in the pacific northwest. i have a subscription to sunset so i guess that will have to suffice but i do wish bh&g would take that into consideration. otherwise i love this magazine. i used to get several magazines but this was always my favorite. it is chock full of ideas that we can really use. and i love the photography. what sets bh&g apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses. slippers on the floor newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too. they are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot. it helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable. i would say get this magazine right away. i would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing.

" better homes and gardens has been a staple in our home for years. this essential magazine seems to always be there for you. when i think about it i would say that it has enriched our home and ultimately our lives. its very visual style of lending ideas for enhancing our domicile and our surroundings has always been simple yet effectual in enriching our lives ",positive
" this is an excellent magazine about american history. the magazine provides a wide range of stories on a bi-monthly basis. it doesn't repeat the same stories that most people know but it tries to tell instances that are not as well-known. in some cases it is little known stories about significant events and other times they have stories about little known pieces of american history. i only wish the magazine had a monthly publication ",positive
" the magazine was exactly what i wanted and super cheap through amazon.com. i am happy with my purchase ",positive
" this is perhaps my favorite photography magazine. the printing is fantastic as is the subject matter. i really like the fact there are no ads in it at all. so many photography mags are just an extended catalog for b&h or adorama that this is a breath of fresh air. the photography itself is second to none. always something interesting and fresh ",positive
" there's a lot to like about lenswork - the selection of images the quality of the printing bill jay's end notes - but the thing i like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment. brooks jensen (the editor/publisher) doesn't appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it. all that matters is the image. and after you've finished looking at the images you'll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue too. highly recommended ",positive
" this magazine is ill! i learn about all the new albums coming out read the reviewand if they say they are good i go out and buy 'em. the reviews are also accurate giving the appropiate number of stars. i also love the sections on the new artists on the verge. the cover stories never seem to dis-please me always givin' me plent of info. the mini articles are cool too from stuff like warren's sapp's all-star football team to all about how mike jones was discovered. one last thing i love about the magazine - they are never thin issues and you know what that means!!!

" of the big 3 (fortune forbes and businessweek) i like fortune the most. businessweek feels like it's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing. forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose---to report and analyze the business world. fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does ",positive
" yes the magazine is great... but up to 1/3 of the pages are ads. they will shamelessly load you up with renewal letters. and occasionally you get a big stinky aol disk in with your issue. kinda like someone dooking in your cheerios. welcome to the mainstream media ",positive
" this magazine is... well... sweet. i love it. i picked up a subscription in january and i think it's great. they get previews on a ton of games even those that aren't that gossiped about. they bring a vieraty in opinions when it comes to there reviews. they get a scoped up article on new games very fast. they're not centered on only the good games but they also include a shame of the month (lowest scoring game of the month) award. they include three scores from a scale of 1-10 and the reviewers simply put out the truth and down right say that a game sucks. they have full coverage on new platforms and games. they also include posters and stragety guides with some of their issuses. this magazine is alot better than the dragonball z obssessed gamepro. its fast and relibel. definetly a great buy.

" intermezzo is without question my very favorite magazine. i think it's the best magazine on the market; most beautiful most interesting and has the best recipes. have already made several recipes from the new issue and they are phenomenal and pretty simple too. particularly loved the pear nectar punch which i served at my christmas party as well as the saffron chicken which i have already made 3 times. i used to alternate subscribing to bon appetit and gourmet but have let those lapse. have given it as a gift to several friends who love it as well. any time i have had a change of address or customer service question i have been pleased and astonished with the personal and prompt attention of the staff even once the publisher heself. i think intermezzo is a small company putting out a world class publication. i do wish it came out more often though as i would love to see more of it.

" as your grandfather told you you can't always judge a book by its cover. nor these days does the title of a magazine always clue you into the content that begins on page three. refreshing then to page through an issue of car and driver and find that --still crazy after all these years--it's *still* about cars and drivers. don't get me wrong; the usual suspects do appear month after month in columns that dig into one aspect or another of the auto industry. and there are those ubiquitous pages of ads from the major auto producers and the after-market confectioners of shiny things to bolt onto them. but everything else is about cars and the people who drive them. to be slightly more accurate: about cars written by and for the people who drive them. a fair number of pages are given over to the exotic and performo varieties of the four-wheeled and the fast. but car and driver displays no embarrassment about majoring on the cars that the rest of us drive. or might drive or might choose never to drive given due attention to the reviews put into the hands of drivers like this reviewer by drivers who drive for a living. 'wanna' know what madonna drives? buy another magazine. 'wanna' know what's new in the '07 chevies fords and bimmers? that would be car and driver ",positive
" i came across olive when i was in london this past may (2005). it was a free supplement to that month's issue of bbc good homes so i wasn't expecting much originally. am i ever glad i didn't just toss it in the bin as i would normally do! olive is devoted to cooking that is as my title suggests simple elegant and healthy. great editorial photography makes that food look great and all its' recipes use readily available ingredients. each recipe is short telling you what you need and how to prepare it and not much more. sidebars or runners at the bottom of the page contain info related to the recipes such as how to cook the perfect steak (i.e. bring the steak to room temperature; use a very hot pan and oil the meat not the pan). under the section fast food one of these recipes was for mini wellingtons has only 5 ingredients and is ready in 30 minutes. another section details how to make a signature nobu (the famed sushi restaurant in nyc & london) dish cod with miso and the recipe isn't at all intimidating (although obtaining some of this dish's ingredients might be difficult unless you have access to an asian market or similar online site). gi diet followers can also benefit from olive as nearly all the recipes contain gi-related nutritional information. chef gordon ramsay also edits a column and shares his favorite tips and recipes. the only reason i give olive 4 stars instead of 5 is because many recipes contain both metric and imperial measures. however conversion info for the metric measures is easily available online. olive also uses british stove/oven indications such as heat the oven too 200c/fan 180/gas 6 but i was easily able to convert these to fahrenheit. so why subscribe to olive instead of an american cooking magazine? if you are like me american cooking magazines can be frustrating in that recipes are often (and unneccessarily imo) complicated and better suited to those who cook for the purpose of entertaining large groups of people. many healthy cooking magazines don't contain gi index info and fail to present it in an easily understood way. many cooking magazines 'on this side of the pond' also are chock-full of ads and you have to get through them before you can get to the recipes or information that prompted you to buy the mag in the first place. olive is clean uncluttered and appeallingly presented. what's not to like?

" i've been a subscriber of e magazine (which stands for the environmental magazine) for over a year now and i love it. it is by far the best environmentally oriented magazine i've come across. all of the ads are for environmentally-friendly companies and products i now purchase products at at least 50% of the places advertised in this magazine. e magazine covers topics all over the world including global warming horse meat (popular in europe) whaling deforestation etc. if you are concerned or interested in environmental issues i would highly recommend a subscription to this magazine. the issues are bi-monthly but are absolutely action-packed and fact-filled. subscribe today ",positive
" i use this magazine for my three kids (ages 9 11 and 13) who are homeschooled. they love the magazine because it makes history more fun than dry textbooks and they get to really experience what life was like in a certain era. each article includes discussion questions activities movies web sites and additional books to read. what is so great about this is that when one of the kids is really interested in something they can jump off and explore more on their own - perfect for self-directed learning. and it saves me time in tracking down this stuff. some of the more memorable articles were ones like how to storm a castle hobo signs in the depression success in ancient china and how chocolate conquered europe - definitely not standard-fare topics but fun nonetheless. my kids are getting hooked on history as a result! sure it's $5 per issue but it's pretty thick (60+ pages) and has no ads. you can check out a sample issue online on their web site to see if it is right for your kids ",positive
" when i picked up a recent issue of natural home i was pleasantly surprised. i enjoyed the magazine so very much! if you get a chance to flip through it and want validation for your salvage instincts and your love of great design ....you may find it just as inspirational. from the article about adding pretty (and smart) shutters to the interior of a home for cold winter nights (they go under the window treatment and help increase the r-ratings for insulating any window against the cold--this technique has been used in other countries for centuries); the use of ventilation and healthy air is already an obsession of mine; and getting rid of clutter by thinking about things we own and the spaces we put them in a new way was refreshing. try this project appeals to the use it don't just throw it away! girl in me. finally designing the structure of a house around its usability is something that i really like. there is so much wasted space in today's new construction...i really don't understand it. natural home challenges you to create something new out of what you already have...a breathe of fresh air ",positive
" i was really pleased when i recieved my first issue. i wasn't sure what to expect from this magazine but it was wonderful. the design and layout are so much more interesting than other magazines that alone makes it a joy to look at. the articles are so great and really offer insight into living a more &quot;natural&quot; lifestyle in the home. i am really happy that someone has put together this resource because it can be diffucult to find good information on natural products and alternative housing. i was very inspired by the stories about building straw bale homes and can't wait to see more. i wished the magazine was longer so they could show more photos and insights. this is really a great resource for the eco-minded.

" what a great magazine - its like receiving a small book of knitting patterns every few months - most of which are totally wearable. i really feel this mag. rides the line between fashionable and practical. i have gotten 4 issues so far and have knit 1 or more items out of each issue. the directions could use a bit more description - sometimes the designers think you can read their minds but nothing a trip to the geniuses at the yarn store won't fix. there are also interesting articles about things like merino sheep - something you wouldn't think was interesting but then you start reading it and can't put it down. love the book reviews and ads - i ordered a dvd from one of the ads and am so so happy with it. i also bought a book after reading the review and have been enjoying it. keep in mind that these are fashion models and really try to picture your body in the item before you go spending a lot of time on a fitted tank that will make you look massive. i got this as a gift and will definitely be renewing my subscription when it ends. ",positive
" this is what i use when i want to knit something for myself. the patterns are hip and young and they always feature the latest greatest designers. this is also much more about fashion than any other knitting magazine out there- lots of runway pictures and rail-thin models posing knitwear in exotic locations. i find that each issue has a good mix of projects of varying skill levels. i have knitted several and i'm happy with the instructions and i've never run across any major pattern mistakes. i find that the exact yarns however can be hard to find. they usually give you enough information about the yarn and desired effect so that you can easily substitute. while i'm careful not to pick patterns that won't be embarrasing to wear next year they do have a lot of hyper-trendy patterns. it would be a pity to waste all that time and money on something that would be decidedly out by the time you finsih it.

" i have been a long time subscriber to vogue knitting it was one of the few us knitting magazines that had really fashionable knitting patterns. i am from germany where there are lots of knitting magazines with really chic patterns i missed that when i moved to the us. however i find that the content in vogue knitting really fluctuated - sometimes it was packed with great designs sometimes it was just too far out and there wasn't a single pattern i wanted to knit. i stopped my subscription for a while. then the editor changed and now the magazine is somewhere in the middle - not too funky yet still chic and fun. i still enjoy reading it every once in a while. after having my daughter i changed my subscription to family circle easy knitting since vogue knitting does not carry any patterns for babies or kids which i really find a shame. i even wrote a letter to the editor saying that this was a major omission. especially because it is very hard to find chic and elegant kids knits in magazines - not those acrylic yarn patterns with bears on them! the german magazines do a great job of having some unique but still fun kids designs. if you want a very trendy knitting magazine that uses a whole range of yarns (some very expensive) then vogue knitting is the magazine for you. if you are looking for elegant knits that are more functional but still challenging i would suggest interweave knits and rebecca (english version of a german magazine) both carry some really interesting and challenging patterns. if you have kids there isn't much out there i would suggest family circle easy knitting also rebecca does a kids issue once a year which should not be missed ",positive

" my impression of mainstream american food magazine is that they focus on mostly hearty meals and thick dense and rich desserts which is not what ij'd like to include in my diet. delicious magazine is different it has a lot of refreshing and light dishes. it is more expensive then the other magazines probably because it's being imported and printed in australia (instead of printed in china like other books nowadays). you should try to see if your local bookseller carries it because the cover price is only us$8.99 per issue/month. when i am writing this review amazon is selling it for us$126 for 11 issues. you do the math ; ",positive

" golfers share many things in common and one of these is an often fanatical love for the game. for these types nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course but golf digest comes very close. this magazine contains over 200 pages each month dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf. the things that set golf digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews. other golfing publications attempt to help you learn but they often get too mechanical. golf digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals including some of the star- studded members of the golfing elite like tiger woods. besides all the tips and tricks golf digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game. this personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine's overall appeal providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine. golfing digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course but it comes close. i consider it the best publication of its kind and i recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game.

" if you are into cars or know of someone who is than this magazine should make you or them happy. lots of cool pratical information and pictures for when you are in the market or just want to see what is hot and why. besides reviews and ratings for most consumer friendly autos there are nice features on those dream-mobiles that most of us only fantasize about. there are also nice articles on auto shows a section called trends where gossip aand opinions blend to pique your interest. there is usually an interview with some automobile innovator or mainstay too. the breakdown of an autos profile is helpful if you are shopping for a new vechicle or you just like to compare what is out there. even if you are not in the market it is an entertaining magazine for browsing. the featured concept cars which often never get into production or limited production are worth checking out since most of us will never see one let alone own one. a pretty good magazine for the car lover in your family ",positive

" based on negative reviews either i've been knitting too long to still have good sense or completely in the dark when it comes to this magazine. it is my favorite and i do not always follow patterns exactly but use ideas in my own sweaters. i found about 6 cardigans in just the last 2-3 issues (a reviewer didn't find any in a couple years of issues). re zimmerman-type designs you can make any sweater in one or two pieces change gauge needle sizes yarns etc. search websites to give you the basics for free. after 2 years of crochet i learned to knit at age 8 with 2 pencils for needles found that quad-ruled pads were great to chart patterns whether plain fancy aran jacquard sideways or you-name-it. i like knit 'n style. thanks for reading this ",positive

" as a library administrator i get to see and read an awful lot of woodworking books and magazines. i have been a personal subscriber to woodworker's journal for a year now and an off and on reader of the magazine for about 5 years. in that time i have grown to appreciate this as a very good woodworking magazine. is it my favorite? no but i still like it well enough to recommend it to others. i also regularly read fine woodworking workbench wood popular woodworking etc. and like all of those this magazine has its strengths. i find that wj is very into power tools tool reviews (theirs are among my favorites) and shop projects. having said all of that i also must confess that the best piece of furniture i ever built came from a plan in wj magazine (an arts & crafts style wine storage table) so don't pigeon-hole it too much. try it for a year and i bet you won't be sorry! ",positive
" there are two good ways to tell what audience at which a woodworking magazine is aimed. the first is the type of advertising and the second is how much skill do the projects expect you to have. it is pretty clear right away that woodworker's journal server home woodworkers who are already of moderate skill. the advertised 'big toys' run in the 500 to 1500 dollar range although there are a couple of high end combination machines in the adds as well. articles expect you to know how to use the tools of the trade but not sure about the 'best' way to do something. a recent issue makes a study of an intarsia backed high chair with some interesting joinery and instructions for making a genuinely exotic angle jig for a table saw. writing is solid and reasonably illustrated but they devote little space to what you should already know which can make these projects a stretch for a tyro. the magazine is very tool oriented. there isn't a lot of space devoted to hand tools or history. expect articles comparing nail guns and helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment is right for you. however traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due. i found the woodworker's journal suited me quite well and i expect to continue reading it ",positive
" i subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to woodworkers journal since 1990. each magazine has a character of it's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents. this magazine is a bit more complex than say wood magazine. it should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified. i have one of woodworking journal's projects in my living room. it is perhaps the most beautiful piece i have ever made. if you have become an advanced amature (sp?) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others ",positive
" this is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures. this particular magazine is about 60% color pictures. at least the issues i've bought were. this is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut. a majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above. this is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait. since this magazine is pictures of celebrities you can also use it to keep track of their hairstyle changes ",positive

" i agree that this magazine boasts designer clothing with extremely high prices that most people cannot afford but may people be aware that this magazine is called teen vogue and obviously will follow in it's big sister's footsteps. vogue does not feature clothes from walmart and so teen vogue will not either. this magazine does not necessarily cater to only rich people. who says that a person should only buy a magazine when she is going to get the exact clothes featured in it? i am definitely no millionaire. i'm 16 years old and still in high school but i enjoy this magazine immensely.of course i dont slip out to marc jacobs when i'm done reading and get myself the shirt on page 79 but i do look at the styles so i can understand the new trends and just inspire myself some. magazines dont always have to be realistic. fashion is about pursuing beauty and covetting beauty and if all magazines only featured affordable clothes' from walmart and old navy well.. i really wouldnt know what that would be like. teen vogue is a pure fashion magazine. it isnt an all-round magazine for young girls. it's only fashion. and it does a great job at what it strives for. the fashion is great and the taste is great the shoots are amazing. a former reviewer reccomended seventeen and i want to note that seventeen is a different type of magazine entirely. seventeen is extremely mainstream bubblegum and is not very fashion orientated. personally i do not like that magazine but i'm not going to condemn it here. teen vogue is classy stylish and lives up to it's name. you dont have to be a rich kid to read this magazine. but it's the only teen magazine out there which is dedicated souly to high fashion and yes features the best fashion. people who are not interested in fashion will probably hate this magazine and that is probably why it has recieved so much criticism. i on the other hand love this magazine. the only reason i didnt give it five stars is because the reviews above deemed the stuff in it affordable for young girls and that does strike me as ridiculous. otherwise look to this magazine for some fantastic fashion inspiration ",positive
" at least as far as the magazine itself is concerned but cardplayer is a vastly superior website with up to the minute tournament coverage email and a ton of other things. all in online is definitely worth checking out on a regular basis however. i just read two hardcopy issues when i was in vegas and i liked the features pro coverage interviews and book reviews. should you be miles from a nearby cardroom and have a jones to advance your knowledge then you can do so rather passively by reading a publication that closely follows the pro game ",positive
" you can buy a subscription to the bimonthly audubon magazine but the best way to get it is as a benefit derived from joining the national audubon society (currently $35/year). conservation is a central theme of this magazine but it also has lots of gorgeous photographs of sandhill cranes snowflakes caribou and everything else that you might expect from a nature magazine although the articles tend toward pessimism ('grim realism' some might say.) there are also lots and lots of ads for people who would like to go eco-touring or birding in exotic locales. i learned to my dismay that i'm not even classified as a birder because i've never traveled somewhere to see a particular bird. i'm just a humble birdwatcher who tries to identify the avian species that show up at our feeders (everything from wild turkeys to ruby-throated humming birds.) on the pessimistic side the march-april 2005 issue of audubon has warnings about global warming (which might affect the fertility of leopard geckos) easter ducklings that parents buy for their children then drop off in the local pond when they get too big (most breeds of domestic ducks and geese can't fly. basically the unwanted ducks sit in the pond and starve) the over-harvesting of dead wood in european forests (bechstein's bat nests in dead wood) and the american eel which has to run the gauntlet of bait hunters turbines and spillways...in a constant battle to hold its own. there are some bright spots too: the red-tailed hawk known as 'pale male' is holding its own in new york city along with its mate lola. 'freecycling' on the internet has inspired more than half a million people to keep their junk out of landfills--i thought this was going to be an article about e-bay but 'freecycling' is something different. it's more of an 'adoption agency' than an auction site. if you're interested in 'freecycling' your extra firewood or an outdated computer check out the website at freecycling.org. anyone who is interested in birding or the state of the world's ecology would do well to join the national audubon society. your membership fee will help in the fight to protect endangered environments and species and you'll get this interesting magazine as a side benefit.

" elle decor (us) magazine is the best of them all - by a long shot. i subscribe to and buy off the shelf about 10-15 different decor magazines a month from around the world. elle decor is the best. it dosn't matter what style you like this magazine covers it with great style and always with integrity. the editor in cheif margaret russel deserves a medal ",positive
" workbench is a magazine aimed at do-it-yourself type people who like to work on their own home improvements and save money in the process. this publication presents dozens of woodworking ideas for home improvement and a few for hobby with plenty of instructions and diagrams to make sure you get it right. most of workbench is focused on the exterior of one's home. as you page through an issue you will notice plenty of articles on building wooden decks new porches and other decorative ideas to improve the outside appearance of your residence. there are a few projects for the inside usually dealing with construction of cabinets bed frames and other things. but for the most part the articles deal with outdoor woodworking tasks. i like the photos in this magazine because the projects always look so fancy. they are perfectly constructed clean and well- finished and they make you want to get off your booty and start working on your own home. in many cases the articles in this magazine do tend to make things seem a little too easy when in reality these projects can often take many days or even weeks to finish. but the end results are worth it not only from a financial standpoint but also from the sense of pride you feel from a job well done. workbench is a little more expensive than other magazines but for those who enjoy working with their hands this publication is worth the cost. with some effort and some good ideas you can greatly improve your home's appearance and value with some new outdoor trimmings. workbench shows you exactly how to get the job done with plenty of woodworking projects to enhance your residence inside and out.

" i've been a subscriber to outside magazine for several years and it seems to go through its ups and downs in terms of the strength of its editorial content especially regarding the political side of environmentalism. it is still easily the most informative magazine out there for lovers of the outdoors but just note that the focus is on active not armchair appreciation of nature. beyond the occasionally great and always heavily knowledgeable product reviews the key strength of this magazine is the well-written and strongly researched articles on outdoor issues of concern not just in america but around the world. an outstanding recent example among many concerns the economics of environmentalism in the conservative western u.s. this is the type of strong conservationist reporting that can usually only be found otherwise in books. other more whimsical articles are just fun to read for those with off-kilter interests such as recent pieces on urban rock climbing or sauna fanatics in finland. many other articles could be classified more as travel/tourism than adventure but the accompanying photography is always top-notch and the editors have a knack for finding out-of-the-way hidden treasures around the world that are ripe for discovery by the adventurous. (but on the other hand the magazine could be faulted for contributing to the recent trend of hyping previously unknown outdoor paradises that have since become crowded such as molly sods wilderness in west virginia.) personally i would like to see a little less focus on expensive vacations that extreme sports fanatics can take in hard-to-reach nations and more on what folks with more realistic means (and amounts of free time) can do in humble parks and forests near home. but despite its habit of losing its focus at times i will continue to be a fan of outside for years to come and might just travel to some of those hyped exotic adventure locations.

" casino player is the end-all magazine for the serious gambler (and the gambler who likes weekend fun with lots of comps!). it is one of the pricier magazines but the cost is well worth it and it isn't over-run with advertising. the letters to the editor touch on basic gaming slot and comp questions and i always glean useful information from the q&a section. the magazine content covers slot machines video poker strategy and probability table game strategy and expected pay-offs investing in the gaming industry's publicly-held corporations and reviews of properties restaurants and shows. i always read it before heading to vegas to learn what is new and happening on the strip and in the area. casino player provides balanced coverage of vegas atlantic city indian properties and riverboat casinos. as a southern ca native i usually skim features outside vegas but the magazine should be commended for reaching out to gamblers in all parts of the country ",positive
" i used to dream about subscribing to threads and drool over them in the library but the new format beginning in fall 2005 is disappointing. they have added many more articles of interest to very new sewers such as how to choose the correct needle for a fabric. this basic info is readily available in many basic sewing books and it is not why i renewed to threads for another 3 years. this magazine once showed cutting edge techniques and lots of projects that intermediate and advanced sewers could savor. as a beginning sewer i used to dream about conquering the exciting projects in threads. now they have watered it down to appeal to less skilled people at the expense of the projects and information that made it stand out from other sewing magazines. this is still a good magazine but no longer excellent. i wish that i could get back my money for the next 3 years and spend it on fabric ",positive

" i ordered back issues of this magazine from an ebay dealer in the uk after the spring 2006 issue came out and i am sold not just on burda plus but on berlin fashion designers as well- the women anyway make lovely flowing but not girly clothes that are very wearable - think eileen fisher or flax but with darker richer colors fibers and textures slightly more fit and more interesting shapes in a wider variety -- not just the same few repeated again and again. clothes for the decades not the season -- and the patterns are here! at least some of them from designers like evelyn brandt doris strietch (and another berliner (female) whose name escapes me at the moment but whose clothes i deeply admire.) the fit is better than most american pattern companies - especially pants. if you make one garment from each issue the subscription has more than paid for itself. good info on sizing patterns up or down in the back issues i recently received - keeping the proportions if using a petite or a tall pattern if you are neither. pattern directions themselves can be less than enlightening though - perhaps non-fluent would be the best description of their translation. and the breathless tone (lots of exclamation points!!!!) of the editorial content seems a bit much for such smart clothes but we're not buying this for the elegancce of the writing! another reviewer complained of delivery delay. this is only published in january and july. if you missed subscribing in time for the last issue and the print run is gone you have to wait until the next one pubs. and the print runs do sell out. as i can attest ",positive
" contrary to the previous review the majority of the patterns in the fall/winter 2005 issue were normal sizes (5'6). this particular issue contains 10 jackets (two of which were for petites) four skirts (one of them petite) three pants (one petite) and four shells (two petites). there were no dresses and no blouses with sleeves. the interesting fabric choices and the superb fashion photography were also excellent. this particular issue also had an article on how to change a petite pattern to a regular pattern and vice versa. the pattern pieces have unique sophisticated shapes very interesting for the intermediate to advanced sewer. one thing i did find lacking was there was no casual sportswear. the magazine seems geared toward business suits and formal occasions.

" science matters. you already know that. you want to stay on top of what's happening in medicine space research earth studies and more. that's because you know things like aids earthquakes and changing weather patterns all have huge significance to human needs and social policy. but you don't have the time or the specialized knowledge to plow through piles of academic journals every week hunting the nuggets that mean the most and translating them into the language of normal educated reader. you want science news. it's brief and readable so you don't have to dedicate half your week to keeping up with what really matters. it's weekly which matters in a world where month-old news is old news. and it's written so that any concerned citizen can understand the science and the issues. the editors don't write down to the readers but they don't assume specialized education either. intelligent high-schoolers or precocious tween-agers can grasp the important parts of each story but specialists (including one university prof i know) use it to keep up with news outside of their research areas. try a few issues at your local library - you'll probably find that you'll want your own. //wiredweir ",positive

" i have had the subscription for 2.5 years now and i enjoy getting it bimonthly. the recipes often do call for hard to find ingrediants (since i don't live in a real big city) and most of them take alot of prep time and cooking but that's why the magazine is cooking pleasures. it's not quick 'n easy. i gave the magazine 4 stars instead of 5 because i find that most of the recipes are pleasurable in comfort and not calories or fat. i love the desserts and main dishes they usually have its just that most of the dishes are not good for the waist line. but i guess that's why its pleasures and not light ",positive
" a friend introduced me to this fun magazine. without being ponderous it has more useful and accessible information than i've seen in one food or wine journal in a long time. i've learned practical things like not to buy the econony sized vermouth 'cause it won't keep well once opened or the best sparkling ciders what wine to bring as a dinner party gift and why guinness tastes better in ireland. it has great virtual trips - like to thailand oaxaco and jamaica woven around the theme of the liquid pleasures produced in each country - everything from tea to rum or chocolate. i find it humanizes the products from all over the world that i take for granted - while giving me imaginative ways to serve them. when cnn starts to drown me with bad news this snappy mag is as refreshing as thai iced tea or a tall vermouth cassis ",positive

" unlike many of my friends this was not a traumatic time for me. however it took quite some time before i could read anything about the era. now that it is so long ago that it is sort of a dream i wonder if i should have kept up with this magazine. i now find it intriguing and wish there was more on the area i was in. the major players are displayed but not so much the more personal information. yet i have friends that were in many of the groups depicted in this magazine and it like any other specialty magazine of a time and place can hold special moments for them. there is also a good magazine for people that missed their chance to take place in vietnam in that time in history. as with any experience if you ere not there then you can not know but this comes closest to an objective telling of history. be sure not to overlook the ads as they are an intricate part of the magazine and offer some interesting items. 1/10 th cavalry 1967-68 armed recon.

" i've been a faithful subscriber to america's civil war since 1993 and i'd say that it's easily one of the best history-related magazines in existence. i read each issue cover-to-cover even the letters to the editor. long after i first started studying the civil war almost 15 years ago i'm still learning a lot from this and other magazines like civil war times illustrated (which is also great). in each issue of america's civil war you can find a variety of articles in the following categories: personality (which focuses on a specific soldier of officer) eyewitness to war (great first-hand accounts from both soldiers and civilians) men and materiel (weapons and equipment) reviews commands (focuses on individual units) preservation (of artifacts and historic sites) and of course several articles which can cover a wide range of topics from battles and leaders to politics and slavery. although i wish more would be written about the neglected western theater i feel that the articles cover most aspects of the war very well. i love the artwork and outstanding maps that accompany the articles. and america's civil war is all about pleasing the readers. back in 1997 i mailed in a questionnaire from america's civil war after writing that my favorite issue had a great article on the famous irish brigade. a few months later a new article on the irish brigade (by the very same author) appeared in their magazine and i was very impressed by this. bottom line: if you are a civil war buff this magazine is just what you need ",positive
" fortune is the best business magazine i've ever read. the articles are insightful and well-written--informative without being dry ",positive
" if you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis forbes and fortune are the two conventional choices. i started reading fortune - and subscribing - four years ago when i realized that the business people with whom i associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages. it fits as a must-read monthly overview in my reading habits. fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro-business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends. you won't find anything radical here but you need to have read it if this kind of news analysis and opinion fits your job description or personal interests. there is a smattering of 'toys for the businessperson' in each edition. for me the highlight is stanley bing's delicious irreverent and every so slightly jaded backpage column. i routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at bing's corporate lunacy as i do. fortune is behind the eponymous fortune 500 and other derivative lists. for me one of the most valuable is the magazine's annual '500 largest corporations by revenue' though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests. other readers will tear out or access other fortune lists online with equal interest. if you're in business or work with people who are you'd better be reading fortune or forbes or both ",positive
" fortune is a classic on the newsstand and is as vital and important today as ever. fortune generally caters to people with a managerial bent especially upper-level executives but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world the global and national economic climate and forward-looking technology and trend information. each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story like the enron trial or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year. i do enjoy the articles where they rank things but more than the rankings themselves i am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings; while i don't always agree with the magazine i do always find it good food for thought. the features are generally very polished and accurate and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a ceo as to a college business student. i particularly appreciate the interviews that fortune has with key players in the financial industry and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue. the magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like kiplinger's. nonetheless the investment advice and insight fortune offers should generally be held in high esteem. i also appreciate the coverage of key trends and in particular want to note that fortune has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in america: coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader. many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money; while there are several i would recommend fortune remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends and should be a part of everyone's business library ",positive

" i have been a subscriber for some time. it's a business publication that does not focus solely on wall street financials - they are there to a lesser degree but this is not the publication if that is what you are looking for. think entrepreneur or general business topics and that's business 2.0. it does not focus on one topic or industry but covers all to some degree - think `oddball' as well. monthly sections include `what's next' `what works' `what's cool'. the articles are cutting edge in some cases well researched and well written with an informal slant. they cover tech marketing product development product design ideas new products and services m&a's and a wide range of general business topics. you will find out about new things before most of your coworkers giving you interesting conversation fodder for the water cooler happy-hour settings. to go even further in figuring out their demographics and target market/s the ads include autos like camry land rover lr3 mini cooper and even the porsche boxster laptops business productivity software like office 2003 business products like copiers and printers mobile calling plans hp credit cards and even lufthansa airline. so if you are not in this demographic maybe they're not targeting your demographic. why buy: you are an up and coming business major or business professional in your `building your career foundation' of your career. you are entrepreneurial minded. you want to keep on top of a wide range of business topics and even some that are not yet making the news. as a gift for someone with these interests ",positive
" business 2.0 is one of the few business magazines i read on a monthly basis and just recently extended for another 2 years. one of the most valuable aspects of this magazine is their analysis of the bleeding edge companies - i don't want to limit my reading to case studies and best practices from the biggest most obviously successful companies. i want to know what the startups are doing and what the oddball companies with new ideas are doing differently. not everything is going to apply but since your own business must constantly evolve i like a magazine that focuses on the constant changes of a variety of businesses. why four stars? to be honest when the magazine was purchased by its current parent company a couple years back i feel the quality took a bit of a hit. i don't care for the new design though i'm sure it saved a few dollars. and the number/quality of articles also slid a bit. but all in all its still one of the better business magazines out there and by far the best in the new economy sector ",positive

" i sew and i love this magazine. till recently i had an annual subscription and i need to refresh my subscription again. here are some helpful tips on why you might like to subscribe even if you don't sew and how to do so if you are out of the states area. for canadians there is a burda magazine reseller and it will cost about 10$ canadian per issue. which is much less than a normal pattern now. so it saves you on patterns. burda has ways to subscribe for each country just go to their website and click till you get the reseller for your own area. why burda is the best! the fashions presented are 2 years ahead. i found that styles presented in burda were a year ahead of hitting the stores in retail and 2 to 3 years ahead of the other major pattern companies and about 1 year ahead of burda's pattern envelopes sold in the fabric stores. even if all you do is look at upcoming styles and never sew a stitch you will find this magazine useful to keep ahead of trend curves. this is what the european ladies are wearing. all clothing is well put together showing current trends (future trends for north america!) in europe in shoes purses jewelry colour choices and more. they use fashion forward textiles to make the garments and the photos are clear enough that you can get trim detail and figure out fabric from your local store. looking at their trends page in each issue will give you an idea where things are going in accessories as well as fashion. if you do sew this magazine will keep you from wasting money on outdated paper patterns and keep you in the front end of fashion. after all if you go to the trouble of sewing and fitting it's nice if you can wear something for a few extra years and look up to date while doing so. each magazine comes with all the patterns in regular sizing to make all the clothing featured. look thru see what you like and trace off your own pattern. a note about sizes --burda fits much closer than normal pattern companies which makes for a much nicer fit but you may find yourself needing to go up a size or two. measure carefully and try cutting one size up till you get used to the fit. don't cut into expensive fabric till you are used to how they fit. make a few cheaper garments first. the armholes and the crotch area fit differently than north american clothes. plus sizes are not in all the featured clothes but have a separate plus size section in the magazine. really nice styling for plus sizes too. however be aware that above a size 20/22 in north american sizes won't fit into these plus sizes. their idea of plus is 14-20/22. they have a special plus size magazine as well as burda moden which is all plus sizes and it comes out twice a year. i found that to be a useful addition to my regular burda magazine and the clothing was never duplicated from one to the other. children's and men's outfits are featured in many but not all of the issues. here are a couple of helpful hints to dealing with tracing off the patterns in the centerfold. i used waxed paper in the usual kitchen type roll and traced with a sharpie marker pen. why wax paper? it's cheap you can see thru it and you can fuse it into bigger sheets as needed. fusing wax paper: take a warm iron and press thru a paper towel so you don't get wax paper on your iron. (when you finish run your iron over a clean terry facecloth to absorb any wax that seeped out). when fusing hold till the wax paper clings and it will look a bit bubbly. edited to add: use a highlighter pen to mark the lines you are tracing off. it will help you see the correct pattern peice and the correct size in the spaghetti trail that is the master pattern in the centerfold. tracing: burda patterns don't come with a seam allowance so i added that after tracing my patterns. using a sharpie and a straight edge for long runs i traced off my desired size in the patterns which look like multicoloured spaghetti lines all over the newsprint center. about all those lines. here is where my wax paper tip comes in handy. i've tried tracing paper even interfacing but the multiple lines on a burda magazine pattern are too much for those usual tracing papers or interfacing. you will need something much more see thru. wax paper! cheap almost transparent sturdy and won't bleed sharpie marker ink. burda doesn't print one sided pattern masters so you have to trace. you can't just sacrifice the rest of the patterns to cut yourself one only since the other peices will likely be printed on the back. remember to add your seam allowance once i cut out my pattern (and write all the notes about what size layout darts etc on the pattern) i put my pattern pieces in a manila envelope. pattern envelopes for home made patterns work best with some labelling. i put the magazine (june 05) and the page # (34) and the model i'm copying along with the size the yardage i require and any sewing notions or extras (zippers interfacing 17 buttons yada yada) maybe due to being a bit obsessive about such things i sketch a line drawing on the envelope with a note saying skirt pants jacket or whatever the garment is. my drawing isn't perfect but i try to include a front and back view with major seams and darts drawn in. it's useful. i keep them in a normal household file folder since the manila envelopes fit perfectly. file under jacket dress skirt etc. or by year. there i hope that helps. this is well worth getting even if you never sew a single stitch from the magazine.

" this bimonthly magazine is a wish book for those of us who don't have two full-time gardeners on staff or a few acres of woods to devote to bluebells or the ruins of an ancient abbey to train roses against. my regency ancestors were breaking their backs on hardscrabble new england farms rather than building follies or planting mazes or having their grounds landscaped by capability brown. oh but what if.... i've subscribed to the english garden for many years now and i don't think i've ever gotten anything useful out of it but the gardens photographed within its glossy pages are to dream for: acres of blooming rhododendrons; statuesque old sequoias that were planted when victoria was queen; lavender hedges; outdoor rooms that have been replanted to a 17th century plan; a sundial pool; and of course a bluebell wood. there are plenty of suggestions for the serious gardener. for example the current issue (july 2005) features the following: * for year round colour buy a couple of peacocks. their screams will also scare away the burglars * one gentleman favors beer for slugs although i don't dare use it here - the gardeners would drink it! * hazel twigs bent over beds and urns will deter the peacocks * add a touch of history to your garden with an italian carved white marble seat. it can be picked up at sotheby's garden statuary sale for a mere 25000 - 40000 pounds. (i absolutely lust for this bench but alas my pension must be spent elsewhere) * use perfumed plants in the conservatory because the warmth generated by the glass pumps fragrance through the house * plant marigolds in your walled kitchen garden to keep eelworm and whitefly at bay * flank the path to the summerhouse with rhododendrons and white narcissi * to break up a long path use arches lightly clothed with jasmine or clematis if some of the above tips are a bit too steep for your pocketbook you can do like me and drool over the marvelous photographs of someone else's jasmine arch and italian carved marble.

" if you are looking for more opinion than straight reporting and stats rather than highlights tsn is your sports magazine. years back tsn was seemingly slated to go the way of sport magazine; one that couldn't find a niche in the internet and cable era which ultimately would spell its demise. it also took tsn to take a body blow from usa today - when its baseball weekly cut into readership - and overhand rights by espn the magazine to find its way. tsn is truly a survivor. the in-season reporting is not based on editor's deciding what's hot. those seeking out quick hits - for example - on auto racing don't have to wait for the indy 500 or the nascar chase for information. my biggest criticism is the reliance on lists - the best of the worst of etc. - that tend to become major stories when certain sports are ready to crank up for the year. granted many radio-talkers will pick up on the lists - and oftentimes give the compilers time to gab about it - but these features ultimately fall into a lazy week of gathering news. overall though tsn is better than ever and has a product that any sports fan would find informative.

" years ago 'the sporting news' was the fans' 'bible'. i can remember what a special feeling it gave to look at it the real lowdown the most bottom- line stuff more statistics than even the greatest baseball nut could ever remember. i no longer really follow the game or any of the games as i once did. and most of the figures even the names of the players are strange to me now. i picture in my mind my uncle the late broadway abe freedman who lived his life to see the yankees lose picking up this paper and cursing at some columnist proclaiming the yankees the favorites to take it all in the coming year. that coming year and so many coming years are already gone. but there will be a next year a next season another sporting news' and someone somewhere in america devouring those numbers as if they were crackers jack and cold beer at the seventh- inning stretch.

" sports car international never loses focus on its mission: providing insight into everything that defines a true sports car. i do not need to waste time flipping past crossover reviews or cup holder size specs. from the absolutely most exotic and expensive supercars to the new hard-top mx-5 it just sticks to real sports cars. seems simple right? yet no one else gets it quite as right ",positive
" i have subscribed to the all of the big car magazines for years i am glad i stumbled upon sports car international in australia of all places. the articles are all well written and devoid of the mindless blather you find in most of the other rags. i enjoy that they only write about interesting cars i don't read car magazines to help me decide weather to buy the new camry or the accord most of the other magazines cater to this crowd to one degree or another. the photography keeps me pacing in front of the mail box waiting for the next issue the shots of the bugatti veyron on the salt flats were the latest ones to blow my mind. my only complaint is that the magazine is bi-monthly i would gladly pay twice the money to receive it every month.

" well i echo what all the other reviews have said about this magazine. subscibing to this magazine is making sure that unbiased articles can still exist for all makes and models of sports cars. you see there are extremely few ads in this magazine and so even though the mag is a bit smaller than say a car and driver magazine it is loaded front to back with reviews. one after another. the photography is fantastic and just looking at the pictures makes you wonder what some of the other mainstream magazines could be like if they could just try to put out a better quality product. even the cardstock of the paper is first rate. it makes the car and driver mag feel so cheap in comparison. both come to my address and i honestly can say that i look forward to both but for different reasons. i first stumbled upon this magazine at an airport 6 years ago and i am so glad that i did. i would love to see more articles with affordable sports car alternatives as they print at the end of each issue. i remember an article about what used sports cars you could buy with certain dollar amounts and this was to me (a man on a budget) a rather nice look at the market as a whole that year. also we are not all 16 year olds out there subscirbing to this magazine so it would be nice to see road tests on at least one moderatly priced non exotic each issue. thank you for putting together such a high quality magazine for your readers to enjoy.

" this is a great magazine for people who like to drive for the fun of it. rather than try to cover the entire automotive industry like some of the other magazines sports car international focuses on cars that are fun to drive. the articles are interesting and well written. the authors aren't afraid to point out a car's flaws and the reviews and impressions seem quite balanced. most importantly this magazine is written from the perspective of the driving enthusiast. the authors focus on the things that make a car fun to drive not stuff like cupholders. if you're into fun cars both new and old this really is a must-have magazine.
