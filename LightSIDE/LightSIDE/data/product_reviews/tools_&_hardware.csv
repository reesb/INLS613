" wow! just received my toro 51598 ultra electric blower/vac and all i can say is thar she blows. this blower at high speed actually pushes me (at 150lbs) back! i borrowed a friends husqvarna 225b hand held gas blower and the toro ultra litterally blows it away not to mention no exhasut fumes or messing with gas mixture. its quieter and lighter too. variable speed is a very nice option when you dont want full thar she blows. only problem is of course its electric and you need to fool with a cord which can be somewhat annoying particularly when you got a 3 acre lot like i do. but i got 200' of 12 guage cord so am in good shape. it matches up nicely with my toro 38025 1800 electric power curve snow thrower which is also a great performer. i highly recommend the toro ultra blower and the great price from amazon.com along with very fast free shipping. for $xx the toro is a real bargain ",positive
" these bessey clamps are the best of course and the blocks in which they rest let you use the four clamps to square things up easily and securely. the wide forgiving jaws make the tools even more flexible and the jaws don't mar so you don't have to juggle with cauls to protect your work. buying this cabinet door package is a wonderful bargain saving a good deal over purchasing the separate clamps not to mention the custom blocks. i am just starting to make a large number of panel doors for a big project and these tools are going to make my job much easier with a much more professional result ",positive

" had to buy 2 of these when book case i was building was redesigned lol. the clamps are excellent and very strong also very heavy and a lil difficult for 1 person to handle. am very concerned tho of the price increase in less than 6 months from $49.00 to $69.00 each even faster than gas prices.........

" im a cabinet builder for several years. used pipe clamps for most of my career untill some one let me borrow a k-body. now i have 12 k-bodys and mipe vast collection of pipe clamps sits and rusts. improves the quality and speed of your work.....big time ",positive
" bought two of the 98 inch k bodies on march 22 2006 received on may 5 2006 worried about them flexing at first with no problem. anybody that has ever clamped with any bessey k body knows how heavy duty they are and the great price $50.00 bucks from toolcrib made it a great deal plus a free 24 inch k body. the clamps are now shipping from amazon warehouses instead of toolcrib's so don't expect to have them in good shape the first time. when i first ordered them i received two 82 inch k bodies instead wrapped pretty good in four sheets of cardboard. second time shipped i received two 98 inch k bodies well damaged one in a 12 x 12 inch bubble wrap bag covering one end torn open damaged on the red end missing the black plastic end piece and the other packaged what looks like a cereal box crushed red end and also missing the black plastic end. third time ordered i was told i would be placed on the top of the order list when the inventory for the bessey 98 k bodies came in not. last ones received were ok still had to use some parts from the other ones to make two good ones before they were picked up. by the way the free 24 inch bessey k body clamp was wrapped very well and was received on march 28 2006 in excellent shape. when amazon mentioned free shipping they forgot to mention the bad packaging job before shipping. ",positive
" i finally decided to invest in some good clamps so i checked the price at lowes and was dismayed at the price. then i found this set and that i could get all four clamps for less than the price of just the two large ones so i ordered the set. i had never had any really good clamps and figured there really couldn't be much difference between the cheap bar clamps that i had been using and the besseys. boy was i wrong!. i have gotten so that i don't want to use the old clamps and will wait overnight to glue up doors or drawers so that these clamps are available. i don't know how they compare to the other premium parallel jaw clamps but i do know that i am saving up so that i can buy some more of these ",positive
" the bessey k-body clamps are superior for multi-board and cabinet door glue-ups by keeping the pieces flat. wish i could have purchased the k-body clamps instead of all the pipe clamps i own ",positive
" they are a little pricey compared to say the clamps at harbor freight but once you use them you will know why. they are superior in every way. when you clamp with them the wood does not move around since the jaws are parallel. and you can get tons of clamping force out of them. very nice tools ",positive
" i have a fair number of cheapo clamps. or better yet i have a fair number of clamps because they are cheap. sure they tend to fall apart and do not work smoothly but they do actually work. then i saw the amazon promotion for this set of four clamps and those set-up blocks that i always thought were a good idea. the price was too good to pass up and... i am very glad i bought this kit. the clamps are good in all ways and the set-up blocks will make many projects go more smoothly. the bessey clamps have a smooth and easily adjusted sliding action and the clamping ends are large square and glue-proof. the set-up blocks hold the clamps in a positive right-angled way jaws up so you can assemble your cabinet carcass drawer etc. onto the set-up and square everything up easily. this is much easier than trying to juggle multiple glued boards and loose clamps with two hands. it is common knowledge that you can't have too many clamps but not everyone knows that you need a large variety of clamps as well. those on a budget may find that buying a wide variety of inexpensive clamps that will cover most projects and a small set of high quality clamps for critical work might work out well. that is the position i did not plan but found myself in and it worked out well for me on a couple of complex furniture projects. i really think this set is actually a must for all woodworkers ",positive
" i purchased this from amazon and really feel it's a great deal for the money. i've used it extensivly and it works very good. you really feel safe on the roof or anywhere it's used if used properly. you must use it properly for your saftey. it comes complete with all you probley would need. you must read the instructions carefully and secure it properly for safe use. it's a must for getting on your roof and is a very good value for the money. your life depends on this item and everyone should use one if on a roof properly. get it ",positive
" having a small driveway and sidwalk i didn't want to spend hundreds for a new snow blower. i purchased this item and for snow it performs flawlessly. i have used it for anything from 1 inch to 8 inch storms and it displaced the white stuff 15 - 20 feet. easy to use starts right up. i found myself placing a 100 foot heavy duty extension cord on a garden hose hanger right inside the garage door. when it snows i just plug and go. you can litterally toss your snow shovel out. i have a bad back and i feel no strain when using this unit. i have to admit i never used it for a broom but as stated for snow it's a win win ",positive
" this shovel works great.i have only had the chance to use it once but it was heavy wet snow and this shovel peformed awsome.it threw snow 20-30 feet off my back porch ",positive
" excellent tool. no more lifting! the only thing easier is to pay someone else to shovel ",positive
" used it for 16 inches of wet snow (not all at once i went out and shoveled every time snow reached 4 inches). probably best only for small driveways and decks. other customers offer valid points: it only shovels forward which can come back to your face (wear a mask?). it won't handle 6 plus inches of snow any better than a regular shovel. i didn't experience damage to its parts as others reported. you must rotate the handle 180 degrees to switch between snow and broom (another reviewer must've missed this part). you can alter the height placement of the adjustable handle (it was manageable for 5' 10 guy). the broom-mode wasn't any better than a regular broom. i made up for the lack of directional throwing by altering the pattern of how i shoveled. because i was never out more that 15 minutes i never experienced freezing of orange power cord. on sale i think it was a very good value. it reduced my shoveling time and like someone mentioned it broke the monotony of shoveling ",positive

" wow! just received my toro 51598 ultra electric blower/vac and all i can say is thar she blows. this blower at high speed actually pushes me (at 150lbs) back! i borrowed a friends husqvarna 225b hand held gas blower and the toro ultra litterally blows it away not to mention no exhasut fumes or messing with gas mixture. its quieter and lighter too. variable speed is a very nice option when you dont want full thar she blows. only problem is of course its electric and you need to fool with a cord which can be somewhat annoying particularly when you got a 3 acre lot like i do. but i got 200' of 12 guage cord so am in good shape. it matches up nicely with my toro 38025 1800 electric power curve snow thrower which is also a great performer. i highly recommend the toro ultra blower and the great price from amazon.com along with very fast free shipping. for $xx the toro is a real bargain ",positive
" these are great cleaning wipes. living here on the east coast when it snows and the salt and road dirt get all over the car it's not so easy to get to a car wash right away pull one of these out and it cleans so well and leaves a great shine. my husband and i use these even after going to a car wash when you see water spots just 1 sheet will clean it all up. i hope they don't stop making them. lately have not been able to find them in the stores.... ",positive
" these are great! you start out with a clean car and every week or so you dust it and wipe it down with one of these even use the same wipe to wipeoff the brake dust off wheels and pipes. the above reviewer is right about the glass but i always do that separate anyway. i drive a black muscle car and everybody thinks i spend hours on the car. the only problem.....i can't find 'em anymore ",positive
" these wipes are a great way to remove dust from your car and leave a wet-look to the finish (don't use them on the windows though). the shine lasts for several days and a couple of people have asked me what kind of wax i use on my car. when i tell them i haven't been waxing the car they look at me funny ",positive
" these bessey clamps are the best of course and the blocks in which they rest let you use the four clamps to square things up easily and securely. the wide forgiving jaws make the tools even more flexible and the jaws don't mar so you don't have to juggle with cauls to protect your work. buying this cabinet door package is a wonderful bargain saving a good deal over purchasing the separate clamps not to mention the custom blocks. i am just starting to make a large number of panel doors for a big project and these tools are going to make my job much easier with a much more professional result ",positive
" the bessey clamps really help keep my work square while drying. even though they are a bit expensive they have saved me a lot of time and money by eliminating a lot of mistakes. i hope bessey starts making other products for my shop ",positive
" for anyone looking for a+ results assembling raised panel doors you need look no further. even if you just want to obtain some of the best clamps that money can buy this is the best deal on bessey clamps i've ever seen. if they have not raised the price yet buy all you can afford ",positive
" had to buy 2 of these when book case i was building was redesigned lol. the clamps are excellent and very strong also very heavy and a lil difficult for 1 person to handle. am very concerned tho of the price increase in less than 6 months from $49.00 to $69.00 each even faster than gas prices......... ",positive
" im a cabinet builder for several years. used pipe clamps for most of my career untill some one let me borrow a k-body. now i have 12 k-bodys and mipe vast collection of pipe clamps sits and rusts. improves the quality and speed of your work.....big time ",positive
" bought two of the 98 inch k bodies on march 22 2006 received on may 5 2006 worried about them flexing at first with no problem. anybody that has ever clamped with any bessey k body knows how heavy duty they are and the great price $50.00 bucks from toolcrib made it a great deal plus a free 24 inch k body. the clamps are now shipping from amazon warehouses instead of toolcrib's so don't expect to have them in good shape the first time. when i first ordered them i received two 82 inch k bodies instead wrapped pretty good in four sheets of cardboard. second time shipped i received two 98 inch k bodies well damaged one in a 12 x 12 inch bubble wrap bag covering one end torn open damaged on the red end missing the black plastic end piece and the other packaged what looks like a cereal box crushed red end and also missing the black plastic end. third time ordered i was told i would be placed on the top of the order list when the inventory for the bessey 98 k bodies came in not. last ones received were ok still had to use some parts from the other ones to make two good ones before they were picked up. by the way the free 24 inch bessey k body clamp was wrapped very well and was received on march 28 2006 in excellent shape. when amazon mentioned free shipping they forgot to mention the bad packaging job before shipping. ",positive
" i finally decided to invest in some good clamps so i checked the price at lowes and was dismayed at the price. then i found this set and that i could get all four clamps for less than the price of just the two large ones so i ordered the set. i had never had any really good clamps and figured there really couldn't be much difference between the cheap bar clamps that i had been using and the besseys. boy was i wrong!. i have gotten so that i don't want to use the old clamps and will wait overnight to glue up doors or drawers so that these clamps are available. i don't know how they compare to the other premium parallel jaw clamps but i do know that i am saving up so that i can buy some more of these ",positive
" the bessey k-body clamps are superior for multi-board and cabinet door glue-ups by keeping the pieces flat. wish i could have purchased the k-body clamps instead of all the pipe clamps i own ",positive
" they are a little pricey compared to say the clamps at harbor freight but once you use them you will know why. they are superior in every way. when you clamp with them the wood does not move around since the jaws are parallel. and you can get tons of clamping force out of them. very nice tools ",positive
" i have a fair number of cheapo clamps. or better yet i have a fair number of clamps because they are cheap. sure they tend to fall apart and do not work smoothly but they do actually work. then i saw the amazon promotion for this set of four clamps and those set-up blocks that i always thought were a good idea. the price was too good to pass up and... i am very glad i bought this kit. the clamps are good in all ways and the set-up blocks will make many projects go more smoothly. the bessey clamps have a smooth and easily adjusted sliding action and the clamping ends are large square and glue-proof. the set-up blocks hold the clamps in a positive right-angled way jaws up so you can assemble your cabinet carcass drawer etc. onto the set-up and square everything up easily. this is much easier than trying to juggle multiple glued boards and loose clamps with two hands. it is common knowledge that you can't have too many clamps but not everyone knows that you need a large variety of clamps as well. those on a budget may find that buying a wide variety of inexpensive clamps that will cover most projects and a small set of high quality clamps for critical work might work out well. that is the position i did not plan but found myself in and it worked out well for me on a couple of complex furniture projects. i really think this set is actually a must for all woodworkers ",positive
" i purchased this from amazon and really feel it's a great deal for the money. i've used it extensivly and it works very good. you really feel safe on the roof or anywhere it's used if used properly. you must use it properly for your saftey. it comes complete with all you probley would need. you must read the instructions carefully and secure it properly for safe use. it's a must for getting on your roof and is a very good value for the money. your life depends on this item and everyone should use one if on a roof properly. get it ",positive
" having a small driveway and sidwalk i didn't want to spend hundreds for a new snow blower. i purchased this item and for snow it performs flawlessly. i have used it for anything from 1 inch to 8 inch storms and it displaced the white stuff 15 - 20 feet. easy to use starts right up. i found myself placing a 100 foot heavy duty extension cord on a garden hose hanger right inside the garage door. when it snows i just plug and go. you can litterally toss your snow shovel out. i have a bad back and i feel no strain when using this unit. i have to admit i never used it for a broom but as stated for snow it's a win win ",positive
" this shovel works great.i have only had the chance to use it once but it was heavy wet snow and this shovel peformed awsome.it threw snow 20-30 feet off my back porch ",positive
" excellent tool. no more lifting! the only thing easier is to pay someone else to shovel ",positive
" used it for 16 inches of wet snow (not all at once i went out and shoveled every time snow reached 4 inches). probably best only for small driveways and decks. other customers offer valid points: it only shovels forward which can come back to your face (wear a mask?). it won't handle 6 plus inches of snow any better than a regular shovel. i didn't experience damage to its parts as others reported. you must rotate the handle 180 degrees to switch between snow and broom (another reviewer must've missed this part). you can alter the height placement of the adjustable handle (it was manageable for 5' 10 guy). the broom-mode wasn't any better than a regular broom. i made up for the lack of directional throwing by altering the pattern of how i shoveled. because i was never out more that 15 minutes i never experienced freezing of orange power cord. on sale i think it was a very good value. it reduced my shoveling time and like someone mentioned it broke the monotony of shoveling ",positive
" machine worked better than expected received it soon than expected would do bussiness wiht you again ",positive
" have not used the brush yet but does an excellent job on the snow! easy to handle powerful and light weight ",positive
