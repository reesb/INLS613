" bought these for my nikon d200 about 3 months ago. never having used tiffen before i took a chance on a recommendation. vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse i've seen. build quality of all the filters is really not very good. going to go back to hoya's which are much better ",negative

" i am not impressed with tiffen filters i got in this set. the finish of the rings are poor. despite of previously poor reputaion i recently purchased some 67mm quantaray filter from the local ritz camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of tiffen filters. i never got tiffens before had good experience with hoyas. i will probably stay with those from now on. now come to think of it ritz camera indicated the quantaray they had were made by hoya. the glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the hoyas and the quantarays. not a good sign. the circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off. quite frustrating. all of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame but none of the other filters i got before had this kind of problem right out of the box. the set might be cheap but it sure is for a good reason ",negative

" i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. i'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i've had these problems from the gitgo: -i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. very interestingly if the section right above the one i'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless! -the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly. again it might have been a defective unit but i thought i'd point my observations out anyway. i wanted to buy this from amazon it wasn't in stock it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to $40+ so i went elsewhere and got it for $30.

" polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some pop out of clouds. there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs. for instance linear vs. circular film or digital versions or quality vs. price. if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system circular polarizers are designed to work with those features. linear polarizers has their uses but they are manufactured differently and may not work. unless you are certain just get a circular polarizing filter. there are some digital circular polarizers on the market. i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film. i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera. most of the time when it comes to filters; you get what you pay for. does that mean you need an expensive polarizer? of course not just be sure to get the right filter for your needs. what ever polarizing filter you get make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting. spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post. if you need multiple filter sizes consider saving money by using step down rings. currently i use the hoya pro1 filters as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier. the weight might not seem like much but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly. i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me. when it came down to the images at times i would see a browning tint on my photos. the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 but i don't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter. overall i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters. i originally thought it is canon it must be quality. since then i have replaced all my canon filters. this filter works but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters. pros: can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons: bulky and heavy not neutral color balance ",negative
" as a professional photographer i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it. i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera. these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them. eventually the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit!) the cord is indespensible if you need it but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months ",negative
" i am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year). two have broken. as other reviewers noted the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the female end of the cord loosen and eventually fail. i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black spring cover over the screws on the shoe. you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver. if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen. canon should do this at the factory. i use this cord with a stroboframe portrait/landscape grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light. the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord. when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted. i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails. canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable. unfortunately i do not believe that there are alternative cords. it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords ",negative
" i have been using this cord for about a year and i had problems with its durability. it actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months but then it started to fall apart. when mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off making it useless to mount the flash. i had to buy a replacement part from canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece). i flipped the flash carefully from then on but then it still cracked!! i wrote to canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. so far there is no response. a few months later the cord for some unknown reason makes my 550ex flash switch from the ettl to ttl mode and making the flash fire at full power overexposing the entire image. i checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe and the flash worked fine switching back to the ettl mode. for a piece of equipment from canon it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. it's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories. as there are no other oem manufacturers of this cord i am forced to get another one and hope for the best.

" at 300mm this lens is very soft it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus. to do so you need to shoot at about f/11 and then since there is little light available you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. of course the high iso then introduces other artifacts. the focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on. this is a lens that i have constantly fought with. don't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either as it's only marginally better. buy the 70-200 f/4l. it's a far superior lens ",negative
" this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position. i sent the camera for warranty service (i had it less than 7 months) and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. they claimed this happened due to physical damage but this occurred during normal use: i was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new. even then don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty. i had another a410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed) but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service (so i suppose it was no loss after all). obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside. in short this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. if you buy it and plan to use it a lot expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which i'm not doing) soon.

" this camera is incredibly frustrating. i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day the camera takes wonderful pictures. however photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired. if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light this is not the camera for you. the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably. since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon. of course you can use the flash but then your subject will be overlit while the background is pitch dark. and forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on. if it is off your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds. since i take alot of indoor pictures this camera is worthless to me. if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light this is the camera for you. if you want to do any natural light photography forget it.

" i bought this lens for my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find. i knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens. i liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization. i shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed. the pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull. i thought it might have been my new camera at first because i couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad. i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i had for my canon film slr and the results were much better. for the digital focal length though my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor. later i decided on the tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews. the salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when i told him i had this canon lens. he said let me guess you'd like to try the tamron 17-50/2.8. he said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it. i could return it with no questions asked if i wasn't satisfied. he also said that he hadn't had one person return it yet. my first images with this lens were great. they were sharp and had way more vibrant color. there is absolutely no comparison at all. i was hesitant to buy a third party lens but my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results. this is the first review i have ever posted on amazon. i was so dissapointed that i wanted to help others not make the same mistake. after spending $$$ on a digital slr it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens. before taking a chance on buying the canon do yourself a big favor and try the canon and tamron at a local store.

" i do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod. come to find out this model does not have a fluid head meaning if you do any panning with a camcorder it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be. also at the end of a pan the head tends to unwind causing your panned image to back up a little ways. thus i think it's rather misleading to label this as a photo / video tripod. additionally i don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters. finally mine came with a few very minor cosmetic blemishes almost as if it were used. instead of video i'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount. if you want to do video please buy a tripod with a fluid head. you'll love it i guarantee that. that's why i give this one 2 stars ",negative

" this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter it produces flare in the picture. furthermore after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like hoya s-hmc or b+w mrc filters. as for polarizer effect itself i think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day.

" i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost. you truly get what you pay for and this thing isn't worth a plug nickel. i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was @ 300mm (480mm on a digital rebel xt). incredibly soft. even stopped down i would never want to make an enlargement from it. stay away. don't believe the fools who are novices you will be disappointed with this lens. you're much better off to buy the older & used 100-300mm 5.6 (the l version costs more too) but both are so much better than this junker. you're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo's with this lens handheld. having switched from nikon when switching to digital i almost judged canon from this one lens which i'm glad i didn't. don't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did. this lens also had terrible purple fringing almost as bad as the kit 18-55mm. after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses: canon 10-22mm canon 28-105mm (3.5 version) canon 100-300mm (5.6 non-l version) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it. the kit 18-55mm makes usable shots but when i could afford it i sold it too. you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100-300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75-300mm lens.

" the camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures. some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. this camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and i did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer). i bought a sony pda and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the lcd. of course sony said it was my fault and that i must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that pda - after 1 month? since the camera was out of warranty i knew there was nothing they were going to do. so if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! but if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products look elsewhere. i used to be a great financial supporter of sony products - monitors computers camcorder memory sticks etc. i am not buying anymore sony products - i have lost the love for sony and their products! beware! canon here i come!

" i love canon products and i have had a complete canon system for about 10 years. i love everything canon does. however i do not understand canon's reasoning behind producing this lens. the reason for the ef-s lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the film plane. they cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an ef-s lens. they have indicated however that by 35 mm that advantage is gone. why then do they produce a 60 mm macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses? i would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 usm macro. as i said if for $60 i can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on all canon cameras i'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all. granted you might not be thinking of buying a ff camera anytime soon but canon has indicated that eventually they will have ff on all their dslr's so why bother with this lens? the 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the ef-s lineup but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me. my $0.0 ",negative
" after reading the many good reviews here i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera. i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted. the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem. this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black. i could view previously taken pictures (lcd ok) but any new photo i tried to take was black. i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees. once the camera cooled it worked again for a while but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos no matter what. so was it the lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day? i can't say for sure but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder not the lcd since that generates heat or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots).

" i have had this camera since jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10000 shots while on trips and at weddings. don't expect much from it and you will be happy. as an entry level dslr it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. i find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light provided that they are not moving. cons: in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well. battery dies fast. the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting especially when shooting in raw mode. i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode(approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. surprisingly when shooting jpegs i get more shots per charge(over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike. so i always carry a backup film camera (my trusty elan 7). the viewfinder is very dim. when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d's viewfinder. in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap especially when having to resort to manual focus. autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. when shooting indoors the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus. the 420ex flash is supposed to talk to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. however with the 300d this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed. after about five months the shutter button started sticking. i would click it and then it would remain depressed. the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little. another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. and since there is only one thumbwheel it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. for example if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera this is a real annoyance. so would i recommend this camera: if you are a casual point and shoot person it's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos. but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately look elsewhere ",negative

" i have known canon to be a very high quality company. however i was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations i had about this camera. a few years ago i bought the fujiffilm 3800. i loved this camera but after a few ski trips i found it rather bulky. i then bought the canon s500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the s400. for most of the pictures i take on a ski trip this camera is fine. however if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime this camera is worse than a disposable camera. first there is no red-eye reduction. it simply does not work when i set it to take flash with red-eye reduction. second pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry. i would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod. third night picture?....forget about it. i tried to get a beatiful picture of the chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed. so i tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and i could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures. looks like i'll be back in the market for a fujifilm. after all the reviews i've read i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop (e18 lcd etc.). not to mention the terrible service that i have been reading about ",negative

" these are my experiences with the extender mounted to my eos 10d. i'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30d but it looks like i don't want to risk wasting my money. let me explain: let me start by saying that the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the lcd screen. i shoot events at nightclubs a lot so i'm always (a) running around to get shots causing me to sweat which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and (b) i always show the subjects their photos after i take them so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying. for further clarification i'm asian so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities. i run around a lot when i shoot. so the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off. i got lucky once and found it in the general vicinity of where i was but the second time i wasn't so lucky. so what did i do? i purchased another one. not only did i have to purchase the extender i had to purchase the viewfinder replacement (the piece with the soft rubber) because that was attached to the lost extender. another 2 weeks in and again same problem. i didn't even bother buying any replacements as by this time i upgraded to the 30d. if you don't plan on doing a lot of running around then this piece may be okay for you. however please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my canon backpack. for some reason the piece didn't fit tightly with the mount on the camera. another problem as most people mentioned is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day. i guess i'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30d; i'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10d ",negative

" at 300mm this lens is very soft it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus. to do so you need to shoot at about f/11 and then since there is little light available you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. of course the high iso then introduces other artifacts. the focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on. this is a lens that i have constantly fought with. don't upgrade to the new 70-300 is either as it's only marginally better. buy the 70-200 f/4l. it's a far superior lens ",negative
" this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position. i sent the camera for warranty service (i had it less than 7 months) and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. they claimed this happened due to physical damage but this occurred during normal use: i was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new. even then don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty. i had another a410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed) but was stolen in a break-in before i sent it out for service (so i suppose it was no loss after all). obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside. in short this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. if you buy it and plan to use it a lot expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which i'm not doing) soon.

" this camera is incredibly frustrating. i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day the camera takes wonderful pictures. however photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired. if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light this is not the camera for you. the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably. since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon. of course you can use the flash but then your subject will be overlit while the background is pitch dark. and forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on. if it is off your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds. since i take alot of indoor pictures this camera is worthless to me. if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light this is the camera for you. if you want to do any natural light photography forget it.

" i bought this lens for my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find. i knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens. i liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization. i shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed. the pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull. i thought it might have been my new camera at first because i couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad. i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i had for my canon film slr and the results were much better. for the digital focal length though my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor. later i decided on the tamron 17-50/2.8 after reading reviews. the salesperson at the professional camera store guessed that my pictures were very soft when i told him i had this canon lens. he said let me guess you'd like to try the tamron 17-50/2.8. he said that this was the very best lens to buy in the price range and to take it home and try it. i could return it with no questions asked if i wasn't satisfied. he also said that he hadn't had one person return it yet. my first images with this lens were great. they were sharp and had way more vibrant color. there is absolutely no comparison at all. i was hesitant to buy a third party lens but my fears were instantly eliminated after seeing the results. this is the first review i have ever posted on amazon. i was so dissapointed that i wanted to help others not make the same mistake. after spending $$$ on a digital slr it would be a waste not to get great pictures with it because of the lens. before taking a chance on buying the canon do yourself a big favor and try the canon and tamron at a local store.

" i do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod. come to find out this model does not have a fluid head meaning if you do any panning with a camcorder it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be. also at the end of a pan the head tends to unwind causing your panned image to back up a little ways. thus i think it's rather misleading to label this as a photo / video tripod. additionally i don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters. finally mine came with a few very minor cosmetic blemishes almost as if it were used. instead of video i'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount. if you want to do video please buy a tripod with a fluid head. you'll love it i guarantee that. that's why i give this one 2 stars ",negative

" don't buy this camera really. i had it for a month and was taking good care of it. i was initially thrilled. the lcd screen got damaged -- no i didn't drop it. the treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that i was shocked. the customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if i were an idiot. a $181 repair bill for a $300 camera is not feasible. it was a great camera at first but i demand better treatment and respect from the company. look for a better camera look on the web for comments on their customer service and don't buy this camera. i had read very negative things about sony but didn't think they applied -- they really are true. i don't like being called a liar by anyone especially when i am the customer. the camera is a month old and it is now garbage. while i understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty i will not accept such poor treatment and customer service. i teach photography and will tell my students the same thing -- if customer service and respect matter to you then do not buy this camera.

" please be aware of this camera's shock sensitivity i was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the second time. it's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world. the result is it loses it's ability to focus and zoom. it didn't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket with the lens protruding thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly. the first time it happened casio repaired it under warranty. the second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $137 to repair it - that's more than 1/3 the original purchase price. i won't reinvest in a weak product. i'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether ",negative

" i love canon products and i have had a complete canon system for about 10 years. i love everything canon does. however i do not understand canon's reasoning behind producing this lens. the reason for the ef-s lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the film plane. they cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an ef-s lens. they have indicated however that by 35 mm that advantage is gone. why then do they produce a 60 mm macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses? i would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 usm macro. as i said if for $60 i can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach (66 in 1.6crop cameras; useful in macro photography) and that works on all canon cameras i'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all. granted you might not be thinking of buying a ff camera anytime soon but canon has indicated that eventually they will have ff on all their dslr's so why bother with this lens? the 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the ef-s lineup but the 60mm macro doesn't make any sense to me. my $0.0 ",negative
" after reading the many good reviews here i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera. i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted. the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem. this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black. i could view previously taken pictures (lcd ok) but any new photo i tried to take was black. i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees. once the camera cooled it worked again for a while but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos no matter what. so was it the lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day? i can't say for sure but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder not the lcd since that generates heat or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots).

" i have had this camera since jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10000 shots while on trips and at weddings. don't expect much from it and you will be happy. as an entry level dslr it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. i find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light provided that they are not moving. cons: in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well. battery dies fast. the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting especially when shooting in raw mode. i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode(approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. surprisingly when shooting jpegs i get more shots per charge(over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike. so i always carry a backup film camera (my trusty elan 7). the viewfinder is very dim. when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d's viewfinder. in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap especially when having to resort to manual focus. autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. when shooting indoors the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus. the 420ex flash is supposed to talk to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. however with the 300d this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed. after about five months the shutter button started sticking. i would click it and then it would remain depressed. the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little. another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. and since there is only one thumbwheel it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. for example if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera this is a real annoyance. so would i recommend this camera: if you are a casual point and shoot person it's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos. but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately look elsewhere ",negative

" as a professional photographer i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it. i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera. these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them. eventually the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground.

" i am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year). two have broken. as other reviewers noted the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the female end of the cord loosen and eventually fail. i have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black spring cover over the screws on the shoe. you can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver. if you use locktite on the screws then they will not loosen. canon should do this at the factory. i use this cord with a stroboframe portrait/landscape grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light. the stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord. when my cords failed i lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted. i am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails. canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable. unfortunately i do not believe that there are alternative cords. it looks like i will need to keep buying canon cords ",negative
" i have been using this cord for about a year and i had problems with its durability. it actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months but then it started to fall apart. when mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off making it useless to mount the flash. i had to buy a replacement part from canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece). i flipped the flash carefully from then on but then it still cracked!! i wrote to canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. so far there is no response. a few months later the cord for some unknown reason makes my 550ex flash switch from the ettl to ttl mode and making the flash fire at full power overexposing the entire image. i checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe and the flash worked fine switching back to the ettl mode. for a piece of equipment from canon it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. it's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories. as there are no other oem manufacturers of this cord i am forced to get another one and hope for the best.

" i only wish i had read the previous review before i bought this item. i too was trying to convert my hi8 tapes to digital format using the pass-through on my sony minidv handycam. i bought this way-too-expensive cable mostly because it was the only option available. it seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low-end disk drive or graphics card considering the technology involved in those devices. but my real problem is with the failure of sony to reveal that the s-video connection is useless for input. this information is nowhere on the package nor is it on their website. there is a notice saying please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase. you can't read that warning when buying online and if buying at a store there's no way to know what's compatible because they don't include a list of compatible camcorders on the package. i guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website then come back to the store and buy it instead of just buying it and seeing if it works. there is a section of the handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one however they fail to mention that the sony cable won't work despite the premium price they charge. if the problem is that they couldn't make it work with both a composite and s-video cable then they should have just made it work for s-video since a composite cable comes with the camera. shame on you sony for adding a little aggravation to my day and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard. it's enough to make me want to buy a canon camcorder (i buy canon digital cameras precisely because i don't want to submit to proprietary sony standards like memorystick). rant over.

" conclusions: to start from the end i got the xacti ca6 tested it and returned it. here are the pros and cons. pros - 1. very small just put in your pocket and go 2. easy and simple controls 3. super fast start up from sleep mode 4. good video quality when lighting conditions are good 5. the ability to take stills while in video mode (i had no issue with the video pausing no way around that) 6. you get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price 7. sd card that records for a long time 8. easy transfer to computer for editing cons - 1. indoor video unacceptable although the video is brighter the ones my sony digicam takes it is extremely grainy (more so than my sony digicam videos!!) 2. super slow zoom when in video mode 3. in good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry (especially when trying to capture a kid on the move for scenery it might be ok) 4. in low lighting stills are unusable (even at short distance) due to a very very weak flash. 5. red eye almost every time the flash works 6. strap is a joke 7. no lens cover so in short on paper this camera is great i love having the sd format rather than tape or dvd the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless. but....the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting (see above) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions (for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical). this camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand (for taking stills). for almost everyone else it is not adequate i will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a minidv camcorder (going for the elura 100)..... ya i know people told me that this was the best option beforehand i was hoping to prove them wrong....; - ( ",negative

" after a few months use the camera got persnickety often demanding upon startup that i restart it. now that the camera has completely broken down with the lens fully extended and stuck in place i think this was a sign of a too-delicate lens mechanism that was beginning to deteriorate. another durability issue concerns the finish: the plastic coating on the 4-way rocker switch on the back that controls image review flash etc. quickly wore off and there are other small scratches all over the body of the camera. not a big deal in itself but annoying given the other problem. the lens is prone to strange flaring especially indoors where lights in the room often up as large white blotches at various points of the frame. several photos were ruined or have required tedious photoshopping. otherwise the lens is fine and reasonably sharp although nothing to write home about. the camera seems to hunt for autofocus lock more than some comparable models e.g. canon a610. many frames are motion-blurred as well. there are ways to avoid this but i didn't buy a point-n-shoot with fiddly controls and menus in order to mess around with aperture-priority exposure thank you. there are a few things to recommend it: not only is it relatively inexpensive it has a lens significantly wider than the competition--31 or 32mm equivalent vs. 35mm. those few mm's make a big difference when you can't move back far enough to get everything in the frame. it is also quick in its operations (except when hunting for focus see above.) the jpegs it cranks out are extremely colorful--bright red so much so that details sometimes seems to be lost--but generally everything looks good. skintones are good. still with the durability issue this one's not worth it. lucky for me unlike the other user who seemingly experienced the same type of breakdown i did keep the receipt. anyone wanna buy a memory stick pro duo ",negative

" i purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model fujifilm camera reviews here price and functions. at the same time i also purchased the larger xd card. almost out of the box this camera has given me nothing but grief. what others had said about the blurry photos i can certainly echo. a month or so after purchase the lens would not open or it would not open totally. i first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause....after changing the batteries the problems still existed - some of the time. not always - just sporadically. just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities. in addition to that now that i'm looking at other brands of cameras i find the xd card i purchased is not transferable so i'm out the cost of that as well. another malfunction of this camera is after erasing all photos on the xd card taking more photos and uploading the new photos i found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones? i don't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera. i would not recommend this camera to anyone....it's a total dud. i'm very disappointed with fujifilm and am now looking at nikon and cannons. good luck fujifulm...you need it ",negative

" i purchased this item two weeks ago. my thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced perfect addition to the tools necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby (its advertised contents construction and glow-in-the-dark planisphere). after closely examining the item for the past ten days i'm forced to conclude that i was in error and that you really do get what you pay for. as celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy i must confess that i assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name. i have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps. the major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings letter transpositions apparent omitted words and just plain (what we used to call in the old days) typographical errors. additionally when i compare some of the technical information on the maps (i.e. star magnitudes astronomical distances etc.)and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources i have in my possession i also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances. when using a product like this it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains. since i'm not able to do this i must rate this item with one star. when i purchased the item it was marked down by twenty percent. i note that in less that two weeks since my purchase the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent. in this case don't be fooled (as i was) by an attractive price. avoid this product.

" i owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me and i said thank you! because i hated the thing. i used to have a 4mp samsung and it was better than this one. the worst problem: slow. slow slow slow. if you use the flash be prepared to wait 4-8 seconds before being able to take the next picture. it's worse at low battery strength but even with fresh batteries it was tedious. the other thing that disappointed me was the color. the light from the flash is glaring and unnatural and without the flash everything is reddish grainy and blurry. i never found a decent middle ground. i take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light and my samsung wasn't great but it was better than this one. when i look at the pictures i've uploaded on my computer i can see the difference when my old camera died and i got the nikon. the worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else's camera and wishing i owned that one. do some research before you make a mistake like i did. i've heard similar things from others who owned the same camera ",negative

" last year i purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my nikon 2100. i am extremely upset over this purchase i have made since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures. the nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside. the indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint and does not focus well. however the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp. i tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures. the outdoor video works well on this camera too. i am giving this low one-star rating since many events tend to be held indoors. this was definitely my final nikon purchase ever ",negative

" i have to say i am very disappointed with this camera. i had really high hopes for this one. i waited for the hd2 to come out and when i saw a lot of positive reviews i bought one i should have waited. for sanyo to call this an hd camera doesn't make sense. the picture has more grain and noise then my old high 8 camera. outdoors in bright light the camera is ok. low-light is horrible pros: - nice form factor love the look and feel and it's so tiny it fits in your pocket. very portable and something you can take anywhere. - secure digital cards are great can transfer and edit on the computer quickly - still pictures are pretty good. although still digital cameras are better. - hdmi output can plug directly into your hdtv (although if you are used to watching things in hd you will be disappointed) cons: - indoor and low light situations very grainy even with the high sensitivity button. - don't attempt to take still shots while you are filming it works but when you watch the film you hear loud noises and the shot pauses for 2 or 3 seconds and then continues. very cheesy. - you can hear the data being written to the secured digital card on the video which is annoying. i thought sd was supposed to minimize noise. - watching the playback of movement with this makes me dizzy not even fast movement either. - image stabilization is not that great either compared to other cameras i have used. - audio sounds a bit tinny in my opinion this camera is geared for portability and being able to capture moments quickly as this is something you can always carry with you. if you aren't too concerned with quality picture it's probably fine. i really think sanyo has a great concept and one day this could be the end all be all device. for now it should come with a warning of it's limitations. i am not saying it's total garbage but if you have high hopes like i did you will be disappointed.

" i got mine today and it is being returned today. i had high hopes given the reviews so far and the supposed improvement in low light sensitivity. i was hoping for an all-in-one device for stills and video. here's my results: 1) stills. pictures are not too bad but do not compare with a similar 7mp canon sd500 which i own. the zoom works well focusing is ok but slow. the pictures themselves have quite a bit of noticeable noise in them flash or not like they are all taken at a high iso setting on a regular digital cam. so slight disappointment here. 2) video. if this is improved low light sensitivity i would not have liked to see the results on the hd1! video does not even come close to comparing to my regular sony dv camera. focusing is hit or miss and shake is much more evident at high zoom than with my sony. i really was hoping for the be all end all combo device but the hd2 does neither very well. ergonomically it is beautiful and fits in one hand very well. the finish is great and the buttons are well placed. but it doesn't justify the price or quality misses on the photos and video themselves ",negative

" the look and feel of this camcorder is very good. unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities. for example evening party indoor school activities kid drama and orchestra. this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities. earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 which was way better than this camcorder. this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price. one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom. most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors. these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light. if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light i do not recommend it.

" after a week of using this i find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing. mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect so maybe the motor was already fixed :-) my mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender. the zr 500 is ok in low light but you can adjust the exposure manually to correct if it isn't to your liking. you can also adjust the focus too! my friend who is a mini dv guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par. i've made two practice dvd's (with firewire no problem at all) with this camera and like what i see. for those of you that have bad motornoise: try your video software to edit the noise out. power director has that feature. i am happy with this product but i would rather have a higher end model now that i have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder. a great camcorder for beginners!

" the panasonic is very compact very stylish sexy as my wife called it but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa. the colours are good and it does take very good videos but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. if one investigates such things will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi same as sony's canon improves this to 180 and nikon is at 300 dpi. it is not just about megapixels folks but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model do yourself a favour. try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format take the photos pop the sd card into the computer compare the images in photoshop. enlarge to full pixel size (100%) and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. that is what i did since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store but it was very educational for them too ",negative

" my title says it all - i was really disappointed with this camera but before i get into the specifics as to why i must mention a few things first. this was my third camera in the exilim line - prior to purchasing z850 i have owned z60 as well as z600. both were great cameras. i mean what's not to like? clean sexy look; easy to use; great picture quality. but having to work for kodak in the past i decided that i want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing and in order to do that i needed something with a little more manual control so i sold my z600 and got a z850 instead. big mistake! i ordered it directly from amazon and it was a brand new camera. right of the bat i got a defective unit! the problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures especially close-ups. the shots were blurry for the most part and the colors were a bit off as well. how is that for quality and reliability?! but i thought to myself it's okay it happens so i returned it back to amazon (thanks to their great return policy) and got myself another one this time from techtoysforless (it was a lot cheaper comparing to amazon). one thing to be aware of - techtoysforless sells what it's called grey market cameras. i knew about it ahead of time but someone might not and then be unpleasantly surprised. for those who don't know what it is - the grey market refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer. only new products fall under the legal accepted definition of grey market. grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods. frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another. this situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment such as cameras. entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply often at retail but sometimes at wholesale import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there. so the product is legal it's new and it's cheap. but... in some instances there could be minor differences between the authorized product and the grey market one. for example a grey z850 doesn't have an ebay mode but offers an auction mode instead. it's a bit different with respect to settings. also there is no full blown manual in the box but rather a short how to instruction in various languages. however the full manual can be found on a cd-rom. another difference and that's actually a plus i think is that it comes with a european power adapter whereas american sold models don't have that. the biggest concern with grey market products however is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty so you have to be aware of that and check before buying. i knew all of the above but still took a chance mainly because the price difference was significant but also because techtoysforless had a 10-day return policy and i thought that it would be enough time for me to explore the camera and find out whether it's defective or not. in any case i placed an order and three days later held a new z850 in my hands. i didn't waste any time and when the battery was fully charged i started taking shots left and right. all of them were crisp clear and sharp so i knew the unit was good and the lens wasn't defective as it was with the previous one i had. however and i noticed it right away because i tend to take mostly pictures of people the colors were a bit warm. what i mean is there was a slight cast of pink present in all pictures. you wouldn't notice it in pictures of architecture food or nature but people's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural and it was very obvious. neither z60 nor z600 had that problem. i still kept the camera though because i could take care of it by doing some minor editing/post processing. what finally made me gave it up (i sold it on ebay) was the casio's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a broken movie mode. the original firmware version 1.0 that the camera came with had a problem with stair stepping - the movies were jerky and noisy. after numerous complaints by the customers casio released two new firmware versions 1.1 and 1.1b that supposedly fixed the movie issue. but what they in fact did was just cripple it - the movie angle was cut by 40% in version 1.1b and the picture quality actually got worse! version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything but rather improved already decent picture quality and added support for high capacity memory cards. also i've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality. i didn't want to wait to find out so i got rid off it. i didn't do my usual pros and cons type of review in this case and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera but it actually does have a few good things. for one in addition to its big super-bright display it has a viewfinder! a big plus in my opinion especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine. also on top of its numerous preprogrammed best shots it has some manual controls giving you even more flexibility. it's a nice little camera. unfortunately it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability. i wish i could say that i enjoyed using it but it was more of a hassle than fun. however i still stand behind casio products. after i sold z850 i got myself a p700 model which has been discontinued for some time now and is virtually impossible to find anywhere. it's a semi-pro model and offers even more manual controls than z750/z850 models. excellent camera! a true performer! built like a tank has a sharp canon lens and made in japan for a change! (all other exilim models are made in china which could be the reason for poor quality) i've used p700 for a couple of months and... sold it :-) yep... call me crazy call me whatever you want - i just decided that i want even more manual control and flexibility so i got myself panasonic dmc-lx2. one word - wow! what a camera! optical image stabilization wide angle leica lens raw format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera. i've had it only for 2 days now but i'm already in love with it. don't forget to check my review of it which is coming shortly. i didn't completely abandon casio's though - my present to my wife for valentine's day this year - casio ex-s770 in red color. i'm definitely going to get my hands on it also so come back for another review soon. once again i hope i've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions. good luck ",negative

" i have been searching reviews of the nikon coolpix s7c to make sure that it wasnt just me - and i am finding that indeed countless other reviewers are having the same problem and many have taken it up with nikon only to be told 'sorry'. in a nutshell i am a professional photographer and have owned about a dozen digital cameras ranging from the early elph to nice new slr models. i purchased the nikon coolpix s7c for my wife and it is by far the worst one i have owned for many reasons but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is horrible pictures. the 'electronic vr' is simply digital image sharpening the iso adjustments in low light are terrible and what i simply cannot believe is how terrible the autofocus is. couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily and you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures ",negative

" the camera feels slick. the software that comes with it gets a 4 star for efficiency though the intuitiveness is not its strength. while the large lcd display is terrific (the main reason i got it) it is worthless in a high glare situation. you can't see what you are shooting. it's worthless! and since nikon did not give you a viewing lense for such situations there are times whey you have no idea what you are shooting. while the viewing wheel to rapidly cycle through the shots you've taken is quite handy the rest of the navigation is less than intuitive and often takes so long to figure out that you give up. pictures are generally good though the conditions have to be perfect or you get grain or blur. there is one lovely feature but it is only useful on a tri-pod. it is a function which allows you to take a flash photo and have the aperture remain open for a little while after to fill in the background. it creates flash shots without the black void background typical of such pix. i use that feature a lot but its worthless without legs for the camera. i bought this on a whim counting on the nikon reputation. had i known i would have stuck with the canon ",negative

" i really don't know how to write a helpful review for this camera i'm not a photographer; all i can say is that i was not satisfied with my purchase so... *** if you're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get (like i was a few months ago) save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras. *** here are my complaints: flash is too strong (blinding in fact). please do not take this complaint lightly the flash is brighter than you think (it actually hurts i'm talking physical pain here). i actually fear it might have some long term effects this alone is a deal-breaker for me! it's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at nikon. sure you can turn the flash off. but that only brings me to my other major complaint! the lighting must be almost perfect if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash. the lens do not respond well to artificial lighting at all pictures either come out all grainy (if it's slightly dark) or with huge white patches all over if there's a lot of light in the background. even when the lighting is almost perfect you lose a lot of quality (even when using the highest settings 6mp). the scene modes didn't help much i tried everything all the different modes offer so little difference very gimicky in my opinion. even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash there's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear why? i have no clue what so ever. i might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a slightly different pose (but still stable) and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear! must admit though the swivel design is very practical and makes things so much easier. the video mode is great as well. if you don't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash then i must admit the pictures do come out nicely.

" this frame looks great until you turn it on. the picture quality is less than stellar but that isn't what annoyed me about this frame. when you buy this frame don't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program. what does that mean you ask? that means that your photos won't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode. you will have 2 black bars on either side of your images; this will not take advantage of the entire frame. if you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame making peoples faces distorted. i have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation. see below. the build quality of the frame is pretty good. if mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen this would be a nice little frame. a little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio but i figured it out. 16:9 stretches the image making it look distorted. these steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal. i set up a macro in photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse. you will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image. some of your images might be better served one at a time. start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program. 1. go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77% (or 788 pixels) this will make the image look distorted. that is ok. 2. then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77% (or 591 pixels) the image is ready to save. you might want to save as in to another folder so you can go back to your original if needed. 3. copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame ",negative

" in my experience this camera takes great pictures but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily. it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise. this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable. my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended. i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate ",negative
" i'm going to be completely honest with you. i hated the hp camera's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur's out if you do not stand still taking the picture. i've had an old hp camera and i have had this newer hp camera and they are all the same. it doesnt seem like it really matters what mp they are. still bur's out and it is disappointing. i guess it really depends on the person about this camera but i'd rather have a sony samsung or some other company's item. = ",negative
" i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years. i was extremely happy with my olympus but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting. this camera was such a disappointment. just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it. (this only happened when using the flash. i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash.) plus if you used the zoom at all the pictures came out fuzzy. the first digital camera i ever owned (7 years ago) took better pictures! the store i bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy. so i sold the camera and took a $100 loss. i'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera ",negative
" there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website. if there are dust particles floating in the air they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white round glare spots. this symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly. however this is not a malfunction. read: your low-light pictures will have spots all over them! sony does not think this is a problem. it is a design flaw. if you are only going to use this camera in full sun then it is fantastic but seriously there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!

" i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago. i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor. sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one. only patches of the software are available to download. the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device. this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged. sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services. think twice before making your buying decision.

" this is an awesome little camera. except that you can't use it at night! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used. apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera and so dust reflects badly. it's a known problem [...] also it's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology. as a result the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh have you heard of usb??!!) and you have to buy a sony memory stick which probably won't work with anything else you have. on the flipside you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology. but other than that the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick. the lens is not one of those that pops out so not sure if that affects image quality at all but as far as i could tell quality was good. in the end what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??

" this is tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures. and it takes wonderful video. the downloading is easy and in general it's a fine camera. however.... the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare. it's constantly over exposing every subject. i find it practically un-usable. the only way i can get the image i'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the iso to 800. if it had a 1600 iso i wouldn't need the flash at all practically but it doesn't offer that. the other thing i don't like that i didn't realize i wouldn't like is that it doesn't have it's own cradle in which to charge the batteries. the batteries have to be removed and charged seperately. doesn't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it. the batteries lose their charge even when the camera isn't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice. intensely dissatisfying. this camera also has a really long delay from pushing the button to taking the picture. this results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces. i know that most digitals have a delay but this one is epic. i am getting ready to sell this camera and buy a canon. i am a wedding photographer and shoot mostly with my canon 5d. but since this was rated camera of the year by american photo (a publication i trust implicitly) i decided to stray from my canon. bad idea. i'm going right to a powershot. do not pass go. do not collect $200. i reccommend you do the same.

" we bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all eurocam for an upcoming trip to europe. it promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip. sadly the camera is not up to filling this role. we will need to take another camera along with it. however we will take the v705 for its wide-angle lens the reason that we picked this model in the first place. it is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review. the need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera. if you do not need a 23mm lens or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens then you do not need this otherwise mediocre p&s (point and shoot) camera. good: fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens; the 23mm is the default lens; rapid start-up time; internal focus and zoom; chromatic aberration well controlled; can use 4gb cards; freeze-frame and extract any video frame. mediocre: soft images; perceptible shutter lag; slow shot-to-shot times; exposure compensation is easy but steps are too small for digital and is reset when camera turned off; flash does not come close to covering the 23mm; image numbering basically limited to 4 digits; flimsy construction; no manual controls; no raw format; no optical viewfinder; histogram on display but too small to be useful. bad: the absolute worst menu system to be found on a camera; excessive and unadjustable jpeg compression; poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery; unacceptable visual noise starting at asa-400; forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images with inability to save the individual panoramic shots; panoramic component images forced to 5mp; overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image (even with display on `bright'); mpeg-4 video compression gives very poor results. synopsis: if you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot this and the older v570 are the only choices. if most of your images are in bright light the 7mp v705 gives better images. if most images will be in low light the older cheaper 5mp v570 is the better choice. the camera seems very fragile. treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance. if you chose this as your sole camera you will likely be unhappy with your choice. the only reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens. = = = = = some expanded comments = = = = = twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens. this lens has almost decent optical quality; though the camera's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it. on power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens which is ideal for us. however considering that this is truly a specialty lens it would make more sense that the `normal' lens should be the default. best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens. better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens. the camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction. this works fairly well at the cost of even more image softness but even-so barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length. this in-camera correction can be turned off. doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance. however being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is. the only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as: manual settings a physically larger sensor chip raw image files or at least a choice of degree of jpeg compression. at the other end of the camera's focal length the 114/117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion. there are very few circumstances where one would want to use `digital zoom' so as with all digicams the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus. after reaching optical zoom limits one is much better off doing any further 'zooming' in an editing program. kodak's advertised 5x optical zoom is at best misleading. actually it is just flat out untrue. the camera has two lenses. the only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens which is not quite 3:1. the wide angle lens has a fixed focal length. (note in some places kodak claims 39-114 in others 39-117 optical zoom.) also misleading is the claimed anti-blur technology. as best i can tell from looking at the images and at the exif metadata all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa. certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera. speaking of asa. this is an opportune time to address the camera's incredibly poor menu system. it is byzantine: being both awkward and time consuming to use. to adduce `auto' asa ranges from 50-200 to set a faster (or to lock in at a slower) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels. to change from `auto' to the next fastest (400) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls! on either of the other two p&ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control. the menu system is next to unusable in the field. still on asa settings the camera does have sensitivities up to asa/iso 1000 (though the manual only documents asas up to 800 1000 is available on the camera). unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime will never-happen-again moment then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying. at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5. the previous version of this camera v570 had only 5mp but the same sensor size. by increasing the pixel count but not the physical size of the sensor the new v705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor. this has happened with many of the current p&s cameras as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality. my initial experience with low-light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact. another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which when calibrated to the sensor in the camera allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise. doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10 prints at asa 800. if one really wants to get carried away combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography (where dozens/hundreds/thousands of images are averaged together) makes 8x10's at asa 1000 doable. people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak's target market. back to earth. the v705's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p&s cameras. mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression which is not adjustable (e.g. `best' `good' etc). my guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used. this results in small files with a lot of compression artifact. the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5mb in size those from another 7mp p&s i have are 5-6mb. my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8-10mb. the more the compression the worse the image. most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point. kodak picks it for you and picks poorly. the v705's video performance is very disappointing. it uses mpeg-4 compression and at very aggressive compression settings. unless it is a video of your baby's first steps or aliens landing in the backyard you will likely find it hard to watch. the total output datastream is about 0.5 mbs. compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs (total adding sound error correction and time codes is 36 mbs). better to have stuck with mpeg-2 which would give less compression but decent enough (tv quality) videos. that is the choice that most manufactures have made. as a result the videos from my other p&ss have about a 2 mbs datastream and so are of much better quality. the battery. kodak's claim is 150 still images per charge. i am getting 100-120 with minimal use of flash and the lcd on `energy saver'. even 150 would be poor compared with my other digital p&ss where i expect at least 200 and often get 250+ if i am at all careful with power-management. this camera has a proprietary (and hard to remove) 720 mah battery. my (several) other p&ss have 790-1120 mah batteries and i suspect more efficient processors. since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle the battery will likely last most of a day. we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera. though the body is of aluminum the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two. the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use; there is no cover for the charge socket. the media door often dislodges open. truly my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used: that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the (not included in this model) easyshare dock system. this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory and the overly aggressive jpeg compression. shutter lag the bte noire of digital cameras is very evident with this model. i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter and the image being recorded. however based on over 50 years of tripping shutters it clearly varies and i estimate is at best 1/4 second up to a bit over 1/2 second. in addition to the shutter lag there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens. together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment an active child at a particular instant or a wary animal almost impossible. the shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation/price p&s cameras from other makers. the accompanying `manual' is poorly organized childishly written. finish reading this book so you can take and share your best pictures! at best it was written for 8 year olds. the manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the `full manual' however the address given is incorrect. when eventually found the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level. panoramics one of the advertising points of the camera are another disappointment. basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in `panoramic mode' each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image in order to allow alignment. as with most `panoramic modes' focus and exposure is locked on the first image. so far this is all ok; however it rapidly goes downhill. first the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 (not 7) mp. next the image overlay is so dark that even with the lcd set at max brightness it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements. however it gets worse. the images must be joined in-camera! the individual images cannot be stored! in-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry. aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2 lcd in the field gives in spite of the camera's best efforts much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger and higher quality computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home. the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single-stills making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings. of course my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera so we will not be dragging it along. you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production. much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved. reading back through this review i see that it is mostly negative. this makes sense for as i disclosed at the beginning it was my disappointment in this camera's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place. likely i have said all that needs to be said. so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens. except for this unique lens the camera's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p&s cameras currently on the market. if you need a true wide-angle p&s you need this camera. otherwise forget it ",negative

" i too loved the camera despite the small lcd screen size until it got the infamous white screen of death that this particular camera is known for which usually occurs after the warranty expires (1 year). photos outside are great poor low-light photos though but i paid $100 for it (and with $20 coupon it was $80). small lcd screen means that it takes less battery power so the rechargeable aa batteries lasted a long time. white screen of death temporary solution: turn the camera off and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the cybershot logo on the front of the camera. then turn it back on. repeat if necessary. it'll probably happen again but it beats buying a brand new camera if you're on vacation and don't have time to bargain shop ",negative

" i was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review. it's lightweight but sturdy easy to assemble and disassemble and very adjustable. i used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted like a short tripod and it was wonderful. it's also nicely finished and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs it stays together and doesn't flop around while you're toting it. unfortunately that evening i had trouble docking our new sony camcorder and when i looked at the bottom of the camcorder i saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera! to my great relief i was able to pull out the pin with no trouble but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes. i was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod so this is not consumer error.

" it's unfortunate that with a name like canon you expect a quality camera. that's why you shell out the money for an item that you think canon will stand behind. unfortunately this is not the case. i bought this camera to use in graduate school (industrial design). i needed it to do research for my thesis. i figured between that all the product photographs and the need good portfolio pieces spending the 500.00 on an 8mp camera would be well worth the investment. i was wrong. about a month after i bought the camera it started to malfunction. the lens got stuck and would not come out. neither would it go all the way back in so the lens cover would not close (not only putting the lens in danger but draining the battery as well.) it was still under warranty so i sent it to the canon service center in elk grove village illinois. it was received and i was informed that my camera would be returned in 7-10 business days. that was almost a month and a half ago. i have put my thesis research on hold because i do not have the proper camera for it. every time i call the service center i am told that the parts are on back order. evidently they don't know when these shipments are due in their center so they don't know when i will have my camera back. the best part is when i called two weeks ago they offered me a brand new s215. the told me it was a great deal and that i should accept the offer because they never do that (meaning they never offer a new camera for one in repair.) i pointed out that the s215 was only 5mp had a smaller screen and cost nearly 300.00 less than my camera. i also reminded her that my camera was brand new when it broke and i had to send it in. today i was told that there was no information on my camera the backordered parts or when they could send my camera back. the woman on the phone asked me why i didn't accept the s215 that was offered and when i explained and asked for a camera the same model as mine she said they were not authorized to do that. i told her that i was going to spend the time originally set aside for my thesis research to write letters to both the service center and canon corporate headquarters and she suddenly had a technician she could consult and my camera would be back to me by the end of the week. i won't hold my breath but a copy of this review will be sent to canon.

" this s80 used to be the only wide angle compact point and shoot digital camera on the market. it has now been discontinued i'm told. but we're in luck! there are three other digital point and shoot cameras with a real 28mm wide angle lens! these are: 1) the panasonic dmc-fx01 for $250 and the 2) canon powershot sd800 is for $400. and 3) the kodak easyshare v570 for about $350. so you ask who needs a 28mm lens? you do! most people concern themselves with how long is their telephoto lens. but most people who know know that it is the wide angle lens that is most important---most of the best shots are made with a wide angle lens. for example you're in europe and you are trying to get a shot of that cathedral of notre dame over there. you need a wide angle lens. you are in the california poppy fields and you want to get the expanse of the golden-yellow poppy flowers with the huge blue sky filled with white clouds above---you need a wide angle lens. you are sitting at thanksgiving dinner and you want to take a photo from the foot of the table with everyone sitting on the left and right---you need a wide angle lens. you are in the garden of the california mission and you want to take a photo of the entire garden surrounded by the mission walls---you need a wide angle lens. it's christmas day and you want a photo of the entire group of visitors in front of the christmas tree---you need a wide angle lens. this is where the 28mm lens on this camera comes in! so you need this camera! otherwise you'll be cutting off heads and leaving aunt sylvia out of the christmas group photo this year---and she'll disinherit you and as a result of not having a wide angle lens you'll live a life of poverty and misery everafter! :o) if you agree or disagree or know of any other digital point and shoot camera that has a wide angle lens please write email:boland7214@aol. here's one more wide angle candidate: kodak easyshare v705 7.1mp digital camera with 5x ultra-wide-angle dual-lens optical zoom ",negative

" this is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners away from. the first red flag is the ridiculously high advertised magnification of 600x. do you know what you will see at 600x in this scope? nothing but a dim blur. note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. all telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. therefore with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x the increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good. the finder is useless; a 6x30 is barely adequate and this is not even that big. finding any object other than the moon will be an exercise in frustration. the 1 1/4 size of the eyepiece is creditable but too high a mignification for this scope. and the field of view is in doubt and don't even think of using the barlow. buy this scope and after a few outings it will most likely sit in the attic. the review immediately before mine is correct. this is no way to get started in astronomy. in a way it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope. their upper-tier instruments are quite good but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this. in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models. just make sure gentle reader to stay away from the toys. using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. it is a learned skill. and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. if you want to see the wonders of the sky contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on this website) then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8) dobsonian; celestron's own 6 starhopper can be found on amazon for under $290. for more information on buying telescopes see my encyclopedic guide on amazon: so you want to buy a telescope. ",negative
" this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy. here's why: 1. the objective is too small only 60 mm 2.36 inches so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe. i suppose it is adequate for the moon but that is it. the planets will appear as very small disks. one will be able to see saturn's rings but the image will be very small. forget it for deep sky objects clusters galaxies etc. 2. the mount is an altazimuth which will not follow the celestial object in the sky. the earth is rotating and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision. a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects. 3. the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope. the observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening) and will in most cases cause blurred images. the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece. the barlow is a 3x which again is too poweerful for this scope. 4. the mount will vibrate when touched which will cause the image in the eyepiece to shiver which is very frustrating. even for the low price don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. save your money for a larger scope with a better mount. jim konedog koenig astronomy buf ",negative

" i owned this sony for a single day before i returned it to amazon. first off it records in mpeg2 format which is fairly compressed and looks it once you upload to your computer. it is also not natively supported on the mac without a 20$ additional quicktime mpeg2 plugin. which has to be converted before editing. which makes it a slow tedious affair. also the included software is surprise pc only. other problems not computer related - the chroma shift in night mode is intense making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly. i'm not expectant of miracles in night modes but it seems like a simple solution on the production side(sony). the auto white balance could also use the same attention. like the previous reviewer pointed out not a bad camera for the money if you're not serious about editing and you're using a pc. the lcd touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use. all in all i would go for a canon ",negative

" we bought one of these in the spring of '05. we took it on vacation in july of '05 and the lcd screen blacked out a few days into our vacation. i called hp and was informed that a reconditioned (used) camera was all that i could get. the camera was still under the manufacturers' warranty but their policy was to replace it with a used camera not a new one. i had to settle for the reconditioned camera. it has been ok since then. hp's customer service is at best mediocre. there are the usual annoying and seemingly endless voice prompts in order to get to an actual service rep and since hp has out-sourced all of its tech support to the third world i had a hard time understanding the reps i spoke to. this camera also eats a ton of batteries and takes a few seconds to engage after depressing the button which is annoying if you're trying to photograph anything other than a posed shot. all in all disappointing. i will never buy another hp camera ",negative
" normally i wouldnt write a review but i have had numerous experiences with this camera that i thought i would share. my sister first bought the camera and i was amazed with how user friendly it was and i thought the pictures turned out pretty well. shortly afterward her screen blacked out without any great impact or weather damage. naturally i assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way tough luck. i then proceeded to buy one for myself and a couple of months after i had it my screen also inexplicably failed to work. and then for christmas my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one and yet again shortly after purchase the screen was broken. i do accept some responsibility for the damage i imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag perhaps it got rattled around a bit. but three times? i dont find this to be a coincidence and i do not reccomend that you risk your money because you too may have to replace it after 3 months ",negative
" i have owned this joke of a camera for over a year now so as someone with alot of experience with it i advise you not to buy one. i wouldn't reccomend this camera if it was only $19.95 and came with a free sledgehammer to take your anger out on it when you realize you just wasted twenty bucks... - without buying a memory card this camera holds a pathetic number of pictures at any setting above vga. - non hp memory cards are incompatible. - it eats up batteries seriously. - it shuts off without warning for no reason whatsoever. - it will often not recognize rechargable batteries as being rechargable. at this point i am shopping for a new camera because my m407 claims that brand new batteries are depleted and shuts off lovely ",negative

" i ordered the sony dcr-dvd108 on april 9. i still haven't received the camera. what i have received are 2 e-mails stating that the product is late without any sort explanation why. as far as i'm concerned it is too late! the first stated that the shipment would leave on april 16. when i purchase the camera i did so because the add stated that if i wanted the camera by april 12 i needed to order it in the next 11 hours and 23 minutes. this i did. the next e-mail that arrived just this morning and i've been informed that it will arrive between april 26 and may 3. i have already missed recording one of my seven year old daughter's gymnastics competitions and now if stick with their delivery dates i'll be missing 2 more. well i'm not missing 2 more and amazon is getting the camera back. the best part of this is that i don't even have the option of canceling the order because amazon is and i quote ... preparing these items for shipment and this portion of your order cannot be canceled or changed. if you can't get the order out on time you should respect your customer enough to offer cancellation of the shipment or better yet try some real customer service and have the product shipped from a competitor at your cost. i can tell you with certainty that sort of customer service would bring your customers for life.

" i bought this item as a gift and it ended up becoming mine. i have to say i am greatly dissatisfied. here are some main issues i am having with the camera: 1. it is very poorly designed. the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant. buttons are really ugly and operating the camera is awkward and for some functions requires both hands to operate.. 2. the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally. 3. the worst by far is the picture quality. colors are just plain terrible. automatic settings are a disaster of photography. i have used a canon (2mp) before getting this one (5mp). the canon was far superior in quality colors lighting.. i don't need large files of trash i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures. as a result i am strongly recommending getting a different camera. i have had great experiences with canon; and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too. but hp must stop making cameras and indeed many other devices.

" this camera looks cool. but it's so so not cool. the people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves. this is by far one of the worst products i have ever purchased. ever. by the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place. it clips on... but not for long. the camera's internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow. it's complelety unreadable. even with a 150mb card i could only take a few short quality videos. you can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings. and i'm talkin' low quality. worse than any video you've seen online. more problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it. the controls and interface are not intuitive. you'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep. oh and the earbuds that come with the camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk are huuuuge. they aren't comfortable in the least and the cord is too short. i had the camera in my pocket and when i stood erect the earphones were violently yanked from my ears. they're obviously intended for oompa-loompas. i'm sure i could have found more problems with this thing but it eventually died on me for no reason. don't waste your time with this. you will be sorely disappointed. in fact if i could give this product a rating of-10 stars i would do so. i'm so extremely disappointed with this camera ",negative

" received the dxg-506v yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount. many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam. this is kind of like false advertising. this is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices (like the optimus that radio shack sells) and there is also no image stabilization. geez how hard would it have been to put a simple  inch plastic mount on the bottom. as for sound the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting. you can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting. that is pretty bad. the resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970's cassette tape recorder. the best thing this cam has going for it is that it can save movies in avi mov or asx format at different resolutions which is why i got it in the first place. it is also pretty easy to learn and its buttons and functions seem fairly logical. it also has a lens cap. my advice to dxg is this. 1. add a tripod mount. 2. move the microphone forward and do something about that hiss and tinny sound or perhaps add a mic jack so that i can use an external microphone. that would be sweet. 3. improve the cam so that it will do a better job in normal indoor lighting situations. the optional settings do nothing to improve this. i tried them all. bottom line is that i would have kept this cam if it had a tripod mount. there are just too many situations that this comes in handy and it would have allowed me to add a light to the cam for indoor use.

" they have made several changes - some good most bad - since i bought my last sony handicam in 8/2003. first of all there is no carrying strap. this is very inconvenient if you plan to use your hand for anything else except for holding your camera. i managed to jury rig one but it is a royal pain. the docking station is just one more thing to have to carry and when you want to upload your mini cassettes to your computer you have to take the camera off the docking station to change cassettes. this messes up my editing program. fortunately i still have my old camera. the ability to take still shots is better - more megapixels - but not good enough to zoom in or enlarge. while i was told most people prefer to use the led screen (i don't knoiw why as it eats up more power and you can't see clearly in bright sun) i like to use the viewfinder. it no longer has a tilt up feature so i end up mashing the battery into my cheek. this last complaint is about the batteries. sony lied about the amount of time that a battery will hold. the 5 hour battery only charges to 194 minutes on my camera. that's slightly more than 3 hours; it is nowhere near 5 hours. the 7 hour battery does not get anywhere near 7 hours either. their packages should be accurate. all in all it is not as good as the older product. there also should be a setting to stop it from running if the rec. button is not being pushed. this will be my last sony unless they make major improvements ",negative
" for quite sometime lured by media publicity i thought sony a good brand. but this was not at all true for digital cameras. i bought this p73 for myself and an hp 4 mp camera for my cousin much cheaper than sony. both 3x optical zoom. the hp one was far better in image quality. main problem is that photo quality is not so good. it lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy. this fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a cannon or an hp camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions. also in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom say 5x or so in other brands. also during video every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off another irritating fact. not recommended ",negative

" this is the worst camera i have ever owned in my life. i had a fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera that took better pictures than this one! i have taken this camera on 2 vacations now and both times i brought along my olympus slr film camera and both times the olympus pictures are clearer brighter and all but maybe 1 will work with this stupid sony cybershot i end up deleting 3/4 of the pictures because they are blury or have all kinds of funny things happening the only pictures that do work with this camera is during the day time or in bright lighting. on the first vacation i went on with this camera my friend brought along her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free and it turned out better pictures as did my olympus on the second vacation i returned from today as i write this i just downloaded my pictures and deleted 2/3's of them because they are so bad the ones that came off my film camera are perfect! my sister also has the exact same camera which she brought with her and as i went through her pictures same thing over 2/3's of them didn't work i would have just assumed i'd gotten a defective camera if it was only my sony that did not work however hers didn't either i would also assume perhaps it was myself that was the problem however i took a number of the exact same picture on this sony as well as my olympus (as a back up and thank god i did) and the pictures from the olympus as well as every other camera i have ever used have come out fantastic on this camera though they come out horrible so bad in fact that i'm embarrassed to show people! believe me if i hadn't gotten it free as a present i'd be writing a nasty letter to sony as it is though my next camera i'm saving up for and buying from a brand that does nothing but photography equiptment therefore knows what they're doing. sony makes great tv's and home entertainment systems anything else i've bought from them or known someone who has has been junk their camera their car stereos their computers! sony should stick to tv's and home theater it's what they're good at camera's not so much unless you're looking for something cheap that you'd only use in the day even then i'd recommend a disposable they even work better than this camera ",negative
" we had this camera for about a year until on thanksgiving day while out of town it broke. the lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera. we ran out to best buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad. (2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird.) at first we liked the camera and it took good pictures. they look great when we got them developed (costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up super cheap too) and the quality was good. within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap. evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems. inside or outside. i am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i know one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it. also the flash quality is horrible. it takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it's of an object (anything really just not a person) it comes out pitch black. inside the lighting is bad too. the camera can never focus and it's just annoying. i also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by sony that for no reason just broke. one of them broke while in a store getting them developed (in the little machine) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing. the people said there was no way it was their machine that it had to be a default in the memory stick. also the camera is pretty big and clunky. at the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market now it is huge! i am looking into now buying the canon powershot 6.

" i have owned several digital cameras and this is my current digital camera in hands. i would write a short review as a critical person with concentration only on important things to watch for. pros - uses only 2 aa batteries. - battery life is very good. - small camera size. easily fits into a pocket. - can set '+' flash level which forces camera to make a stronger flash. i use it almost every time. cons - resolution. the images are not sharp in terms of that you can't distinguish individual pixels when looking at the real size picture. i would say there is no much difference in quality between 4 mp and 50% (1 mp) scaled down version. the same problem exists in sony dsc w1 camera. - i had many problems with on button. sometimes camera refuses to turn on. it can be fixed by shaking camera and trying again. (it could be a defect in my camera only). - some camera parts are painted plastic which can be scratched. - camera can lose all settings and preferences if left with discharged batteries (~several hours) or without them at all (10 minutes). - video quality 640x480 is pretty good in high quality mode but eats flash space very quickly. windows 2000 didn't have the right codec to view the file. i had to install it by myself. - camera is performing slightly below the average in low lighting condition with auto settings ",negative

" i will start off by saying i loved my sony cybershot. when the alpha came out i couldn't wait to get one. it died after 200 pictures on day three of a three week once in a life time trip through south america. amazon said it was out of their hands because it must be returned within 30 days. i've spent 3 hours so far dealing with sony. most people i spoke to or on-line live chat support were unfamiliar with the product and transferred me around to business support computers video. they also contradicted one another. when i did get to someone who knew the product i was told firmly that despite the camera being a lemon and malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they the would only 'repair it' not replace it. now i am stuck with a lemon and i fear i have a history of further disappointment and frustration with this camera. i highly recommend you read all the customer reviews. other people have had problems with the camera i ignored them because i had faith in sony and thought the other alpha owners' dud cameras were unusual. if you decide to purchase anyway i highly recommend you do not buy through amazon but through a real store with a good and fair return policy that stands behine their products. places like microcenter will exhange no questions ask. i am kicking myself because amazon was $100 cheaper then microcenter. penny wise pound foolish. i love amazon but i will never buy anything other than books and dvds from them. lesson learned on electronics.

" my wife got this for me for christmas. i was thrilled and thought it was a great idea. i charged the device and transferred pictures to it. i work in technology so i agree with many of the other reviewers that the software is terrible -- to delete any photos you have to delete them from the device not the software. image quality is ok but not good enough to be sharing with people. and after a few days of sorting through pictures and transferring and deleting them it got a bit old. other than looking at it straight-on nobody on either side of you can see the image. it's back-lit which is fine...but it doesn't help much. unfortunately the battery didn't last all that long. the device refused to charge after about two months and eventually it died altogether. the only way to make the unit work was to plug in the usb cable; the battery would not charge. so i contacted support and got a basic run-around telling me that you shouldn't charge the battery for more than 2-3 hours at a time and that i could request an rma to return it for replacement. warranty is no good and it can't be returned. i'm holding onto it because i'll probably take it apart and use the internal parts to build a desktop photocube so it can run off the usb cable. but i agree with others that -- even if this worked longer than 2 months -- it's just a novelty that gets tedious quickly ",negative

" downside: 1. i'll have to add my complaint to several others who had the same problem. the camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months of having no problems. i switched batteries...let it set for some time without batteries or memory card in it...nothing is getting it to work. on top of that i now have a memory card with photos on it that i can't transfer to my computer without a working camera to do that. 2. not good with indoors pictures especially if you try the night mode. if you use that mode even with a tripod keep your subjects to still-lifes only...if you photograph people and they happen to move even the slightest they will at best be blurry at worst they will look like double exposures. 3. indoors pictures set at normal mode with or without flash are no better and may even be worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera. upside: 1. through its usb cable it booted right into apple's iphoto software making the organizing and editing of photos that i took a breeze. 2. outdoors with plenty of sunlight gave me near-perfect pictures that got a lot of praise. kodak did well with this aspect of the camera's ability given the price. 3. we won this camera (free) so for me it's almost all upside...except now i have to shell out $$$ for a good camera (that will hopefully read my current memory card ",negative

" i bought my kodak v570 less than a year ago. at first the only annoyance i had was the fact that i had to use an attachment to transfer the pictures and that the video was in mov format that made it diffcult to edit. but a few months ago the focus refused to work properly. in wide angle it was fine but when i zoomed in the image was unacceptably blur. i tried every setting finally gave up and called kodak service. i was asked to mail the camera to sydney from melbourne where i live. a few weeks later the camera returns with a note that there was noting wrong with it. since i still could not take acceptable pictures i contacted them again. this time to be told to send pictures via e-mail. i did and to my surprise the answer was that poor lighting caused the shutter speed to slow down and hence the blur images. but the pictures were taken in broad daylight. when i disagreed with the logic of the comment i was told to call them for a discussion over the phone. but the number they gave me was a fax number. using my resources i got in touch with technical service by phone. this time i was told to try using a tripod and if the pictures come out alright it's probably due to shaky hands! it's as though they have people in tech support who have never owned a camera and who have never taken pictures before in their lives. it is so frustrating thinking of the damage the camera has done to my recent india trip when many of the pictures turned out blur. now i have to put up with illogical and incompetent service people. there is no way i will ever buy another kodak again. i can recommend it only to my worst enemies. i have now to again send the camera in for troubleshooting and going by the level of service so far i am not holding my breath for answers. still want to buy a kodak? go ahead but don't say i did not warn you. by the way my other camera is a casio and it works beautifully shaky hands or not ",negative
" i have to say that i really wanted to like this camera. it takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature. it is quite compact and has a nice screen. the software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface. why 2 stars? ok here's the bad stuff: 1) in the first shipment i got the normal mode (non-ultra-wide angle) didn't work. the images were garbled and almost unrecognizable. the ultra-wide images were fine. i attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange. the second v570 i got from amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me. so i don't think it is just a random problem. there appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that i would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem. my v570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and i use a casio exilim ex-z70. 2) the stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel. you have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle. also since you have to charge the battery in the camera you can't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other. for comparison my new casio ex-z70 has a usb cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger. so if one battery is dead i can leave it behind in the charger while i take pictures with the spare. 3) the movies that you take with this camera are stored in mov format instead of avi or mpeg. while it does play in most pcs if you have installed quicktime it is not supported by my streaming media player (d-link dsm-320rd) and is difficult to work with in the video editor/dvd creator sw i use (sonic mydvd). i can't say how widely mov is supported compared to avi and mpeg but that format created problems for me. so i applaud kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital. but i think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations ",negative
" the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz1 (and by extension the fz3 which has an identical body). i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz1. with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out. if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all. there's also no padding to speak of with this case. by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again. targus makes decent laptop cases but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently. apparently it does fit some cameras just not the panasonic fzs. considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price ",negative

" this is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners against. the first red flag is the ridiculously high maximum magnification of over 700x. do you know what you will see at 700x in this scope? nothing but a dim blur. note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. all telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. therefore with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good. the finder is useless smaller than the bare minimum size of 6x30. finding anything but the moon will be time-consuming and frustrating. the low power 20mm eyepiece may or may not be usable on the scope depending on its design and field of view. that the design information is not given in the ad is disturbing. and don't even think of using the 4mm (high power) eyepiece or the barlow. i do not recommend equatorial mounts for beginners. their tracking properties are primarily for astrophotography and for this they require careful setup. the equatorial mount on this scope is provided primarily as a marketing gimmick to impress nave buyers with its complex scientific appearance. in a way it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope. their upper-tier instruments are quite good but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this. in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models. just make sure gentle reader to stay away from the toys. using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. it is a learned skill. and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. if you want to see the wonders of the sky contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on amazon) then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8) dobsonian; celestron's own 6 starhopper can be found on amazon for under $290. for more information on buying telescopes see my encyclopedic guide on amazon: so you want to buy a telescope.

" this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy. here's why: 1. the objective is too small only 60 mm 2.36 inches so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe. i suppose it is adequate for the moon but that is it. the planets will appear as very small disks. one will be able to see saturn's rings but the image will be very small. forget it for deep sky objects clusters galaxies etc. 2. the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope. the observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening) and will in most cases cause blurred images. the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece. the barlow is a 3x which again is too poweerful for this scope. 3. the mount will vibrate when touched which will cause the image in the eyepiece to shiver which is very frustrating. even for the low price don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. save your money for a larger scope with a better mount. jim konedog koenig astronomy buf ",negative
" my ownership of this camera was brief. first you must know i love nikon. i have 2 other nikons--an old cooplix 2200 and a coolpix 5700. they have wonderful lenses and give great pix. i thought my experience with this model would be similar. not!~ from picture numero uno the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate. i got pictures yes but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens. what a dissappointment! i traded it in for a canon a520 and am happy with that camera. i suppose it is just what it is. if i'd saved and spent a lot more money on a d50 or rebel who knows? anyway that is my sad tale with the nikon 4800 ",negative

" here's the good news: i have had many cameras in my life digital and film and i have found the z1 to be my favorite. the camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color. my previous camera was a minolta dimage 7($800) and i found that this camera's photo quality was just as good. the best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily. owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life. here's the bad news: recently my camera broke and when i tried to contact fuji to get a replacement or a repair the service was terrible. their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support. summary: great camera as long as it doesn't break. it's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get fuji to repair it ",negative

" having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch i was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas to see what a commercial frame would be like. after using it for a few weeks i have to say that if it wasn't a present i would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation. the good: * screen is bright images look great * resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me. doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen. * computer connection worked great - i plugged it into my xp box all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up. it would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue. the bad: my main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before. if i bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $50 i could have forgiven it for the poor design but in 2007 for $180 it is completely unacceptable. we live in the future here people get with the program! i have not used other frames on the market but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12 screen on ebay for $70 strap it into a cheap frame and make your own pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame just by running a screen saver for under $150 i'd say this frame is not worth the money at all. this screen just doesn't deliver the goods for the price. some details: * menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the setup button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global * remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny ir hole in the front of the screen. * screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame (i.e. as a 480x640 frame) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this feature off. * the slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images. your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that doesn't change. * no way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system. * good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens ",negative

" the me-1 provides a modest 1.2x magnification for viewfinders on olympus's e-300 and e-500 cameras. ideally this would allow sharper manual focusing and more precise framing. unfortunately this did not happen when i used the me-1 to make a number of trial images with my e-500 so i will be returning the me-1 for a refund. (for the record i wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting with my shooting eye corrected to 20/20 vision.) like other folks i find the e-500 viewfinder a trifle small so that it's not always easy to frame a shot and see exposure data at the same time. the camera must also be pressed against your face when framing which is not always comfortable. in some ways the me-1 created more problems than it solved. the me-1 kept the camera further from my face (though it seemed to bump harder against my glasses) but at the cost of *narrowing* my angle of vision in the viewfinder. divide the viewfinder into four equal columns and rows so you have eight squares. the four squares in the middle of the viewfinder were easily visible but those along the sides top and bottom were *less* visible than before the corners considerably less. to frame a shot i had to move my eye around the viewfinder much more with the me-1 than without it. to see exposure data i had to shift my eye almost completely away from the image. more hassle than i need when shooting in the field. fortunately there is another option that works for me. the e-300 and e-500 come with an ep-5 eyecup which is definitely too small for my taste. but a larger eyecup is also available the ep-6. the ep-6 keeps the camera a little further from my face. and with the viewfinder diopter properly adjusted (a critical step no one seems to mention) the ep-6 allows me to see both the entire image and exposure data without shifting my eye very much at all. all of this will vary from person to person of course and there may be circumstances when the me-1 is exactly what's needed -- so two rather than one star. but not in standard shooting conditions especially if you need to compose set exposure and shoot quickly ",negative

" not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on. i would turn it off and on and nothing would help. finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in. this seemed to fix the problem a few times. after that i thought it was just operator error. but it wasn't. the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile. an event came up about a month later. i got my camera and tried to turn it on. nothing happened. so i changed the batteries. still nothing happened. i'm not sure what happened. i do believe i purchased a lemon camera. i'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung. it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. so i guess you get what you pay for!

" so this was my first digital camera got it last july for my birthday. i go to a lot of concerts so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. well two days after i got it i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. it would still take pics only you couldnt see them. after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on it went back to normal. alarmed i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again. but that was only one thing wrong with it. this is a horrible camera for concerts the pictures are always blurry. shoot even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. tuesday i went to see my fav band again and the dumb thing goes white. it woudnt stop no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. you can't trust this camera. you never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.i wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute!

" this is the first digital camera that i have owned. overall i am generally satisfied with the quality of the pictures it produces. however there are a few things that if i had known beforehand would have prevented me from purchasing this camera. 1) camera is not plug-and-play (even if they say it is). you have to install the kodak easyshare software to download pictures. this is a huge negative. in the future i will only buy cameras that show up as removable storage drives when plugged into a computer. 2) video is stored in apple quicktime format (*.mov). the is also a huge negative. the codecs for this format are not widely available for application integration. you have to download and use apple quicktime to view them. you can not view the videos in windows media player. it is also not compatible with some photo-album software. i would only buy cameras in the future that have an option to store video in a non-proprietary format. update: after review i have found that winxp and vista plug-n-play with the camera when it is plugged into the usb port. it does not work on win2k. thanks for the comment that made me double-check ",negative

" i bought this product from a nearby retailer. the packaging is deceptive. the photoframe must be plugged into an external power source or you must buy a uniquely designed battery from the manufacturer. the battery is $35.00 with shipping and it is poorly designed so that when installed the battery case rubs the connector wiring. this frame has no on-board memory so to use it you must have one of the two types of memory it accepts. this is an additional expense. after purchasing the photoframe i discovered the plastic frame was chipped and the device did not perform as the instructions said it should. i took it back to the store and opened eight boxes before i found one which had an unbroken frame. i took that photoframe home and discovered the device would not work as the instructions described. i then went to another of the retailers' locations to exchange the device (the original location had shipped their entire inventory back to the manufacturer). with the retailer's very helpful clerks i tested three more photoco photoframe devices none of them worked as described (they would not scroll through and album of photos). i returned the item to the retailer and received a full refund for the device then by email i requested a refund for the price of the battery. photoco replied that if i sent them the battery they would refund its price. i mailed the battery on may 6and then inquired about my refund on may 14. photoco replied that the only employee who could process the refund was out sick. on 3/17 i sent an email demanding immediate processing of my refund. photoco said that my credit had been processed but that i might not see the credit for 7 to 10 days. i still have not received my credit for the battery. if you want to avoid a headach avoid doing business with this company. read the other reviews before considering this product ",negative

" the battery is good after a full charge. it lacks in holding the promised charge. i find after 2 weeks it is questionable depending on how many pictures were taken before the camera sat waiting to be used again. i got over 100 pictures when used in 3 days which is more that my aa nimh 2100mah. which i bought from walmart {so probably not a super battery} the wallmart batteries actually hold the charge longer {very sad}.the charge time is not to long when charger from half charge. over all i hope the next ones i buy will be better than these. my solution is to carry a non rechargeable battery in my case for when the delkin dies. i also try to give it a full charge before leaving the house as there is no memory effect. i also recomend checking to see if there is a firmware upgrade for your camera. every camera shuts off when the battery is at a different power level. my nikon coolpix 3100 seems to shut down sooner than later. all reviews should mention what camera they are using for this reason. have been using 3 months now.

" i purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework and reading all the reviews i could on the different kinds. the one i purchased was flawed and would take 5 or 6 tries of inserting the memory card before i could get it to boot up. when it was running i was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures. what the description of this product does not tell you is - the frame does not come with a usb cable- so it does not hook up to a computer. this means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera or that you must have/purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card.( a side note - if you have a sony digital camera memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format - so forget about using pics someone else sent you took with another camera or you reformatted with a photo program). i went with the digital pic frame from brookstone instead - far better quality and much more user friendly ",negative

" i am [...] the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card. 16 mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough! read on! if you call they will tell you that the slideshow from cards is not possible because on page 13 refers to excluding pictures from the slideshow on only on internal memory. this is not a definitive statement that slideshow is not possible from a card only that excluding individual pictures from a card is not possible. (because the unit is not capable of writing to a media card.) looking further on p13 it states: choosing slideshow frequency note: this function applies to photos stored on all media. page 27 in faq states: 2) q: can i switch between different slideshows photos by using different memory cards? a: yes. when you connect your memory card to photoframe(tm) it will slideshow photos stored on that specific card. finally the quick start guide faq states: q can i switch between different slideshow photos by using different memory cards? a yes digital photo frame will slideshow photos stored in the card or camera currently connected. clearly the three references i provide indicate that the dpf can operate slideshows from a media card. in reality slideshows from media cards does not work. philips how about a firmware upgrade? i bought this thing to allow my mother who is not computer savvy and lives far away to look at family pictures. i was planning on sending preloaded cards to her. all she would have to do is insert the card and turn it on. (mom is 75 and this is as technical as she gets..). do not buy this dpf for older none computer savvy people. since media card can not be used you have to use the internal memory for slideshows. the internal 16mb memory can hold about 70 pictures - that's it. it is also unclear the maximum size a file can be. i believe the internal memory converts the file to a dpf friendly format and renames the file when copying from a media card. (how is mom going to tell me which picture to print if the name changed?) why have media card slots if they are useless? internal memory is way too small! do not buy and save yourself the hassle.

" i bought this camera for its great price good reviews and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter. i returned the camera after three weeks however due to abysmal low light performance among other things. the catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child. i took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor/delivery and follow up. unfortunately when we returned home to view our footage much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes. the camera does include a light and a magicpix option but unless you're using a tripod you're bound to end up with a strobe-light effect (perfect for recreating thriller music videos but not much help otherwise.) i also found the image quality with the gs31 to be fairly lackluster and pixilated. granted you get what you pay for but i was really taken aback that my 1992 camcorder shot much better footage. that being said the camera did a lot better in good/outdoor lighting (albeit still somewhat pixilated) and the zoom is incredible. the camera is very light and smaller than i anticipated. in the end i returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment (...) i will say that amazon did a great job with customer service throughout. also if you do buy this camera make sure to buy the dv cable (firewire for macs) through amazon or some other online retailer.

" i was extremely disappointed with this camera. it's a shame there is no option for zero stars because it doesn't even deserve one. i bought two of them for a vacation to belize because we were planning to do a lot of activities in and around the water and we were hoping to capture those memories without risk to our digital camera. now i really regret not putting a little more money into a waterproof case for our digital camera rather than wasting money on this camera and developing pictures that were only worthy of the garbage can. all of the pictures from both cameras were very grainy - terrible terrible quality. the camera that we took pictures with while diving was slightly better than the one we never even submerged in the water. those pictures were so grainy that we couldn't even tell what the pictures were supposed to be of. extremely disappointing for a camera that wasn't even submerged in water. not to mention both cameras said that there were more pictures left on the roll when there were none so we took shots that we thought were going to be really amazing only to find that they weren't even on the negatives. i was so disappointed in this camera that i wrote to kodak and they offered to send me two new disposable cameras. unfortunately our trip to belize was a once in a lifetime trip so i have absolutely no need for replacements - the damage is done. and i have no desire to ever use one of these cameras again. if you are planning on using a disposable waterproof camera for capturing valuable memories do not waste your money on this one. the only thing you will receive from the photo lab is disappointment. i wish i had done more research before purchasing this one - please don't even bother with it ",negative

" in theory this camera is perfect. fits into your pocket. video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of mpeg-4. pictures are good if you know how to finesse it. perfect all around anytime camrea right? here's the thing. i got the camera mainly for video. i just had a daughter and wanted something for those candid moments that i could always have on me. also i did not want minidv because uploading to the computer is real time. i wanted the sd card as film even if it would sacrfice some video quality. but the thing that ruins this camera for me is the mic picks up the lens motor/ auotfocus nosie. on the playback i cearly hear the zooming in and zooming out and every time the lens focuses. it sounds like someone smoking a hooka. and get this it even says so in the instruction manual page 35 caution during video clip playback the sound of a motor is audible....during recording the sound of the optical zoom movement or autofocus movement was recorded. this is not a malfunction. awful. by the way the take a picture while recording video function is worthless. it leaves a pause on your video image while the sound keeps recording and the still image captured is usually blury. whats the point anyway i think the camera has a built in function to extract a still from the video. or you can do it with whatever editing software you use. oh and one last thing. i have to keep the still camera in sports mode to get a clean pic. my hand shakes too much. there is a digital stabalization for the video but no optical stabilization for the stills. its a big shame too. the camera is very cool. if not for the audible motor noise i would have given this at least an 8/10. but the lens motor noise is unacceptable! ps. all cameras today should have a built in lens cover. this is one has a cheap plastic one that you'll probably lose ",negative
" i really wanted to love this camera. the camera is compact and could fit into the pocket of my jeans! i did plenty of research before choosing to buy this camera so i expected all the quarks of the unit mentioned in other reviews. the 30 frames per second uninterlaced video is good - of course it's not as good as full resolution 60 fields per second video... but the unit fits into my pocket! another huge plus is that each shot is an individual file that can be dragged off the unit and onto a pc using a usb cable. no further processing - the file just copies and plays in quicktime etc. another great feature is the ability to zoom while recording a movie which most point and shoot cameras that record video will not allow you to do. now the sad part; amazon has shipped me two units - both with bad pixels on the lcd and ccd. the bad pixels on the lcd according to the manual are expected and not a malfunction; i disagree with that. for the cost of the unit there should be no bad pixels on the lcd monitor. the huge problem is the bad pixels on the ccd! this results with white pixels being recorded on the files; this is compounded by the image stabilization. the image stabilization shifts the image the ccd receives around in attempt to stabilize a shot of video - and it works great! however as the video is shifted and stabilized the white pixels are shifted around the screen as well. it's almost like there are flies moving through every single shot you record. the bad ccd is the reason why i can't love the c6... i gave up hope and sent both back to amazon. i'm not sure what i will buy now.

" i bought this camera in the beginning of january. i was looking for a compact camera (not necessarily pocket size though) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality. based on test reports at dpreview and other customer reports i decided for the fuji f31fd. i was intrigued by the new sensor that fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive which is true. after receiving the camera i took a lot of test pictures under various conditions with and without flash bright light low light different iso settings different exposure times etc. i compared the pictures with my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 and the results were amazing. the picture quality of the fuji was very poor. colors were 'smeared' but the main problem was noise. even under bright light conditions and iso 100 settings the white had considerable noise same with other colors (rgb noise). i didn't check grey/black noise (as they do in the test reports) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying. what a disappointment. the lens seemed to be pretty poor as well at least there was no comparison to the sony dsc-v1 with a carl zeiss lens. after one week we returned the camera and i bought the sony h5. this is really a great camera i must admit. the picture quality is even better than with the v1 and i thought that the v1 was already pretty good. i can only recommend sony's h5 even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller f31fd. what i liked about the f31fd was its size its responsiveness and the monitor and menu. however if the picture quality is so poor it also doesn't really help ",negative

" this is an awesome little camera. except that you can't use it at night! there are horrible white spots in nighttime photos when the flash is used. apparently these appear because the flash is so close to the lens in this camera and so dust reflects badly. it's a known problem [...] also it's totally annoying that sony uses all their proprietary technology. as a result the cable for connecting this camera to the computer is unwieldly (uhh have you heard of usb??!!) and you have to buy a sony memory stick which probably won't work with anything else you have. on the flipside you can take movies that aren't limited to 30 seconds with this guy - i think that might be a result of the memory stick technology. but other than that the design and operation of this little guy seems pretty slick. the lens is not one of those that pops out so not sure if that affects image quality at all but as far as i could tell quality was good. in the end what good is a camera that can't take usable pictures with its flash??

" this is the 7th olympus camera i've owned over the years from film to digital. i have always been very pleased with olympus cameras and their usual superior optics. this camera though is a major disappointment mainly because even though it can shoot in raw there is no compatible conversion available yet leaving you unable to process raw images. this renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in jpeg. olympus should have ensured that vendors such as adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible raw conversion plug-ins available before this camera hit the market. there's no excuse for olympus to not have made sure this was the case indeed it's downright irresponsible. having said the above the camera lens is quite nice the camera itself operates well. you can take quite good pictures. however the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low-light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken----if you're taking pictures of people they will have moved by the time the picture is taken. the battery life is very good. the camera fits nicely in your palm. and having a 28 - 500 mm lens is great. if you don't shoot in raw and you don't depend on flash photography the camera is worth a look. otherwise look at other products at this time ",negative

" the case looks exactly as in the pictures above and the camera fits perfectly in it. however the case is hardly a protection it's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag. the velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so i've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors. fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around so my camera stays with me in any event. there is a little strap on the case supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps but it opens too easily so it can't be trusted at all (the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case which is not much). there is also a small pocket in the back providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries (4 aa batteries) and the usb cable. again the velcro on it is too easy to open even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket. definitely this is not designed as a practical solution. just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches. if you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun while not being worried of losing the case around -or its contents don't buy this one. spend some more money and get a decent carrying case. i will ",negative

" the night owl optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as i started using it. the system uses high voltage derived from 2-aa bateries. occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. if one is using the instrument the light actually hurts the eye. i have returned the monocular to night owl for repairs. i do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. they told me to ship it at my expense. another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours. other than the above the monocular has performed well. epilogue-night owl optics did repair the unit and returned it.

" this is not the best way to get started in astronomy. the low power eyepiece is fairly useful the higher power one less so and don't even think of using the barlow. the maximum useful magnification for a 60mm scope is about 120-140x assuming the objective lens is of good quality. when you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown. to their credit the manufacturer has provided a reflex red dot finder in place of the useless 5x24 finders that plague so many similar scopes. even so what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited. some star clusters will be dimly visible but galaxies and nebulae will be barely--if at all--visible. in a way it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope. their upper-tier instruments are quite good but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this. in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models. just make sure gentle reader to stay away from the toys. using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. it is a learned skill. and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. if you want to see the wonders of the sky contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on amazon) then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8) dobsonian; celestron's own 6 starhopper can be found on amazon for under $290. for more information on buying telescopes see my encyclopedic guide on amazon: so you want to buy a telescope.

" this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy. here's why: 1. the objective is too small only 60 mm 2.36 inches so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe. i suppose it is adequate for the moon but that is it. the planets will appear as very small disks. one will be able to see saturn's rings but the image will be very small. forget it for deep sky objects clusters galaxies etc. 2. the mount is an altazimuth which will not follow the celestial object in the sky. the earth is rotating and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision. a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects. 3. the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope. the observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening) and will in most cases cause blurred images. the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece. the barlow is a 3x which again is too poweerful for this scope. 4. the mount will vibrate when touched which will cause the image in the eyepiece to shiver which is very frustrating. even for the low price don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. save your money for a larger scope with a better mount. jim konedog koenig astronomy buf ",negative

" i had high expectations when purchasing a laser range finder for use on the golf course. after a lot of research i settled on the pro tour laser. as previous reviewers have stated this unit is very hard to stabilize. i have a feeling this is true of all lasers. even with supporting both elbows on the hood of a car i found this unit very hard to find yardages for objects beyond 150 yards paricularly when bright sunlight is present. on the golf course finding the flag and obtaining a yardage at longer yardages is almost impossible if there are objects behind the flag such as trees or landscaping. this unit has been returned and i have gone to a standard handheld gps instead. once the center of the green is initially saved as a waypoint this is a very reliable and quick method to get a yardage you just have to convert feet or 1/100's of a mile into yards. i do this with a chart taped on the back of the gps. accuracy is about 2-4 yards which is good enough for anyone but a vey low handicapper. i am staying away from a laser finder until golf courses uniformly put reflectors on their poles.

" after reading the great reviews regarding the vct870rm tripod (here and elsewhere) i decided to purchase one for my sony hdr-hc1 camcorder. when i first opened the box the vct870rm seemed sturdy and well made. the tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch and the remote controls on the handle worked well. however the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly. it felt like the tension control knob was tightened but that was not the case. in fact the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed. i recently found a vct870rm review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning. however due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod i'm assuming that i just received a bad one. i'm now in the process of working with amazon to get a replacement sent to me. so far amazon has been great as they've already scheduled ups to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day. they say that i'll receive my new tripod next week. i'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives. update: i received a new replacement vct870rm tripod from amazon and this one works great. panning and tilting are both very smooth and the tension is adjustable. if i'd have received this tripod originally i would've given it 5 stars. the first vct870rm i received was definitely defective. i'm glad i returned it and i'm glad i bought it through amazon (best price at the time and a hassle-free return) ",negative

" if i could i would give this camcorder a 0 of 5. since i now have to search for a new camcorder from reading other panasonic model reviews i am convinced i did not just get a lemon but the panasonic brand is bad. we bought this camcorder 18 months ago at the birth of our son. it has had problems from the beginning. first i could not finalize the disk. i called panasonic support who basically told me the problems we were having were because the camera was not being held still while recording. this is ridiculous since i often set the camera down on a countertop so i can be in the video. then i finally got someone to tell me that i needed to be recording on panasonic mini-dvds. the best it has worked have been on the panasonic dvds which are some of the most expensive and even that is no guarantee that you will be able to watch the dvd after finalization. i still have freezing of the picture and sparatic playback when trying to watch. it has skipped over whole sections. i have 3 dvd players in my home (all different brands) and the disk works on none of them. i finally got an address to send it in for repairs. i was not happy to be without my camcorder for an extended period of time. i was told they would look at the camcorder see if there was a problem and call me. i waited a week after i knew it was in the shop to check the status. panasonic failed to mention that i would need to pay $207.50 up front for them to look at it then if any repairs were needed this cost would cover them as well. so i have been without a camcorder for 3 weeks while waiting to see if it needed fixing and the company i sent it to has not even looked at it because i have not paid them! this is crazy since i can get a brand new minidv camcorder for $225. the only reason it has taken me so long to take drastic action is because we are military living overseas and bought it at best buy. so you see why i couldn't just take it back to the store (or i would have a long time ago)! also after spending over $500 on this piece of junk i could not afford to just replace it. sending it in was not an option when my son was a newborn because i didn't want to miss any precious memories (which i ened up missing anyway!). so now the holidays are upon us and i will be forced to purchase another camcorder since i don't know if they will send it back to me in time for christmas. i will not pay the $207.50 for a camera that hasn't worked well out of the box. i also had to pay shipping both ways for nothing! plus another thing the still picture is bad quality. very grainy and you can actually see pixels when you print it. we only used that function once. i have lost so many disks and have so many others that only play part of the dvd that when i think of it i cry. i have also wasted so much time trying to figure out how to fix the problem with a customer support that is useless. i wish i would have never bought this camcorder! if you are buying this camcorder to capture memories buy another! i will not buy panasonic products again!

" i purchased this camera in december 2005 to replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder. unfortunately everything except size is inferior in the panasonic compared to the ancient sony. the color is not nearly as sharp the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long. the sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself. the camera's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer's editing program. the panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack. this allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights. it uses a toggle to control the exposure and while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the sony it is adequate. unfortunately it functions so poorly in low light it wouldn't provide adequate color in an auditorium. i thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the panasonic than my old sony. maybe it's because the camera is so small it's hard to keep as stable as the larger sony. video editing on a pc is equally easy on the sony and panasonic but the panasonic's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with sony's digital 8. if you don't have to record in minidv format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera i'd recommend buying an inexpensive sony digital8 for about a third of the price of the gs250. if you do have to have a minidv camera and you won't be shooting in bright sunlight try another brand. this upper end 3ccd camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless i need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day. otherwise i'll use the old sony so i can share the video i shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality ",negative

" i've just returned this unit. it doesn't play videos as advertised. i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later. i have now had 3 different brands of 8 photo frames in my possession: a phillips a pandigital and this coby. i have developed the following list of features in my ideal photo frame. first video playback: i've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov more later) i'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is to play movie clips in show presentations intermixed with .jpg photo files. second feature is to play .wma music files in addition to mp3. this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player. all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3. third i would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning off at night for example. fourth i'd like an audio or speaker out feature. none of these frames has home theater-like sound and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i'd probably hook up. video out could come in handy too. fifth i'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software manually or automatically. yes you can rotate them in the computer but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (this may depend on which photo edit program you are using.) sixth i'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. especially with the huge chips now available i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder) rather than switching out chips. here is where the 3 units i've had stack up followed by my next (fourth) unit. i am keeping the pandigital....which costco has for $140. it plays .mov video files but not within a slideshow. it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. it requires mp3 music files. it permits picture rotation. no folder management system. no clock/timer. no ability to play stills/video intermixed. i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok. the phillips didn't play video and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.) the coby won't play my videos even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations. the coby plays .wma music files won't rotate stills has no folder system no clock/timer. it has a speaker out jack. it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. picture quality is fully equal to philips generally the recognized standard. if all you want is photos and never turn your camera sideways this unit will be a good value. another unit i'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci. i've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos.

" my primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting without the use of a flash. the camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). the camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. i believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it. i used to have a cannon powershot sd450 that was awesome but it was stolen and so i needed a replacement. i had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash unlike the 900. i am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose this camera was horrible and it has since been returned. instead i just got a fuji finepix f30 which is supposed to be better without the flash. we'll see ",negative

" i bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak z700. i loved my z700 even though it was only 4mp and didn't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have. i figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6mp would be a no-brainer but i was disappointed in 2 major areas. first the lag time is so slow on the c653 when i took pictures of my kids i rarely got what i was expecting to see. the smile or look that i saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures. we experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference. the other disappointing area was low-light picture quality. anything i shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit. every background was grainy. terrible. using the low-light settings fixed the problem but then your subject is blurry because you're not in sports or kids mode anymore (which we used all the time with the z700 for taking pics of the kids). on my z700 (which is only $150 now) i could set it and forget it. set it to action and it took perfect pics indoors or out moving or stationary. that's what i thought i was getting in the c653 but i was wrong. i ended up returning the camera ",negative

" if you're looking to capture the decisive moment with the nikon coolpix 8400 stop---do not buy this camera!!! for that matter carefully check any digicam or other camera with which you want to capture action because what you think you see may not be what the camera has the ability to capture as an image. let me briefly explain where i'm coming from: i made my living as a field photojournalist for 40 years. by the time i retired out of the business i had probably created something like a million color and b&w film images. i owned and used mostly nikon equipment all those years (although i sure liked working with leica rangefinder cameras and short focal length lenses) starting with the original nikon f slr (which i still have) and finishing up with the n90s and probably ten different lenses of varying focal lengths. i like nikon equipment a lot. i decided to begin working with digital images last year. i was attracted to the coolpix 8400 because the spread on the zoom lens was the 35mm camera equivalent of 24mm--85mm. when i worked with film i probably used my 24mm and 105mm nikkors more than any others in my bag so this little coolpix beauty had just about what i was looking for in one package. let me say that while the problems with the viewfinder and shutter lag make this camera absolutely useless for editorial photojournalism it is nevertheless a marvel of human ingenuity. for many other uses---such as taking pictures of fire hydrants or cows standing in a pasture (put another way things that don't move) it works wonderfully well. seriously i shot an assignment here in tucson that was essentially architectual in nature. the images can only be described as superb (if i do say so myself). i worked only with the camera and a tripod on the shoot. working inside i simply changed the light balance within the menu on the 8400 (which you can pretty much do on any digital camera these days) did not have to check the scene with a separate exposure meter etc. point being that with film i often carried a bunch of light balancing filters and sometimes a separate gossen exposure meter and all sorts of lights to shoot an assignment. even then i'd sweat blood until i could get the processed film on a light table. of course with digital i (you) don't have to worry about any of that stuff. one can check the image immediately and know instantly if you're good to go. alas the shutter lag on this and many other digital cameras made these days is the downcheck which makes me unable to recommend the 8400. there is also the delay in the electronic viewfinder to deal with. the combination of shutter and viewfinder lag make it absolutely impossible to capture an image the precise composition of which lasts only a split-second. i have taken many good pictures of people working action shots and the like but it was only by taking large numbers of images of any given activity and then retaining the one or two that said what i intended that i achieved my purpose. essentially my shooting eye (which is pretty damned good) had nothing to with it. it's like a soldier trying to kill an enemy with a machine-gun---if he fires enough rounds one of them is going to hit the other guy. marksmanship has nothing to do with it. same-same shooting with electronic viewfinders and shutter lag. if you shoot enough images statistically you're probably going to get a good one. but it's not a very good way to do things. so if you're looking to capture what henri cartier-bresson (i'm not sure i've spelled his name correctly) so artfully described as the decisive moment look at a digital single-lens reflexes or wait for improvements in digicams. ",negative
" some digital cameras have no viewfinder at all but the nikon 8400 has a electronic viewfinder and the reviews have been good and the price is great so i bought the camera. the electronic viewfinder turns out to be too dark to see the face of the person you are trying to photograph indoors with the flash you cannot see any expressions just the outline of the person's head so you guess and shoot several times and then see the photos you just shot in the viewfinder. outdoors you cannot see enough detail in the viewfinder to know what you are including in your shot. the display lcd monitor is small and washes out in sunlight. the background of the flash shots is unacceptably dark. after 3 days of use and 90 shots i mailed it back to ritz on amazon this morning dec 5. they require it back within 10 days of receipt of purchase their date of order was nov 29 and it arrived at my house on dec 3. it's a good thing i already had a compact flash card to use there is not one in the box and if i had waited for the one i ordered to arrive well it's not here yet. it cost me $11.65 to return it insured with 2 day delivery and a delivery confirmation receipt. the camera had some strengths as well as it's weaknesses but with only a short time to try it out before the 10 days ran out and serious difficulty trying to see what i was shooting i gave up on it ",negative

" i have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my jvc gr-d70u which died and 2) to go online with a video blog. after much study and evaluation i chose the canon zr800 based on a salesman's recommendation frustration as to the number of choices which are available and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my must-have options). after returning home i read the review by miamian new reviewer and felt trepidation. after charging the battery i tried the camera. lo and behold miamian is right. there is an obvious noise when recording which was not present in my jvc. hoping against hope i played the tape back and just as i feared the tape had a pronounced hiss. this is not just tape hiss but a much more pronounced noise which transfers to the tv when watching. it rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. i took the camcorder back and like miamian ordered the sony dch-hc38. (i know it doesn't have an external microphone jack but after all this confusion i give up!! why don't they make more cameras with them??) the plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book. the joystick selector is so easy to use to select play rewind fast forward stop pause in the playback mode and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes. the wide screen viewfinder (lcd) is so nice to use and easy to see all others (in 4:3) become passe'. i didn't have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit. the picture looked ok; it did not greatly impress me however and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback. in essence caveat emptor; especially if you're hard of hearing. others watching and listening to the tape will not be ",negative
" i was attracted to the cannon zr800 due to the very small size and very low cost. however you get what you pay for although you get much more in other brands for just a little increase in cost. i've already returned my cannon zr800 and replaced it with the sony dcr-hc38. the smallest problem with the canon is the continued motor noise which you should be aware of it if you have read any review for any of the zr800 predecessors. the problem is that the motor is very loud and you will hear a very annoying whirr if you are indoors. this could be forgivable given the low cost but the problem with the zoom noise is not. when you zoom in and out a very noticable clicking noise occurs when you let go of the zoom switch. it is a loud click and when you play back your video this click is amplified on your video. it is impossible to watch a video and not notice this click. it is annoying unusual and a big flaw with these new zr cannon camcorders. i called technical support the person took a zr800 and tried it out and then acknowledged that a problem does exist (she seemed stunned that this noise was occuring). bottom line this camcorder is absolutely unusable due to this clicking noise and would not be worth using even if it were free. do not but it. btw i love the sony dch-hc38 which is a bit more expensive and like the zr800 just recently came onto the market.

" i found the same problem that other users of this product experienced. particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot. i found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash. this leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated flipping of the flash that some other users have reported. the item is manufactured by stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called gadget infinity under the listing title of flash bracket with 90 degrees camera rotate feature. buy it now price is $29.99. i just bought one and it arrived yesterday and i could not be happier. pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years ",negative

" the e550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens. so this means if the subject is moving around a lot such as my daughter playing soccer you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. as long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful. i unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off etc. another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot which can be difficult in bright sunlight ",negative

" this camera is a decent enough camera compact easy to use and takes good quality video and still pictures and the battery life is excellent. the battery that comes with it is good for a couple of hours continuous recording and the tapes only last for one hour. i acquired a second battery that is good for 240+ minutes so i never worry about running out of juice. i have only two complaints really one minor and one major. the minor complaint is the fiddly little controls on the touch screen lcd viewfinder. i find i need to use my reading glasses to see what i'm doing. the major complaint is transfering video to my computer via the ilink cable (not supplied). i have never persuaded it to work. by browsing various camera fora on the web i am finding a complaint identical to mine with this model in particular as well as other sony models. the computer will recognize the camera in usb mode (for capturing still pictures from the memory stick) but does not see it at all when plugged in via ilink (firewire/ieee 1394). all indications are that my firewire port and cable are perfectly ok. sony tech support both web chat based and phone have no clue and because i am out of warranty it will cost a flat $210 to send it in and have them take a look at it. if all you want to do is connect the camera to your tv to playback the video you take it's a good camera. if video capture an editing is what you have in mind buyer beware. because of this i can only give the product 2 stars other wise it would be a 5. update: i installed a new firewire pci card on my computer and using a new cable tried the video capture again. i also tried the camera on my neighbor's mac (on the theory that if a mac won't recognize it you really know you have a problem). the computer still won't recognize the camera. this camera has been used very little and definitely not abused. it was probably defective right out of the box and it appears to be a common problem. if you buy this make sure you test all of its capabilities as soon as you get it. don't wait like i did because i'm out of warranty and it will cost me to get the problem fixed ",negative

" the panasonic is very compact very stylish sexy as my wife called it but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa. the colours are good and it does take very good videos but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. if one investigates such things will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi same as sony's canon improves this to 180 and nikon is at 300 dpi. it is not just about megapixels folks but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model do yourself a favour. try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format take the photos pop the sd card into the computer compare the images in photoshop. enlarge to full pixel size (100%) and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. that is what i did since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store but it was very educational for them too ",negative

" i bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work. i didn't really have high expectations for it because it was so inexpensive. as soon as it was turned on i had the following problems: 1) five seconds after i turn it on it always says usb connected!-- and i don't have a usb cable inserted into it! this also freezes the device. i found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted. 2) i cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual. my computer does recognize the usb device but when i try to copy files over to the frame i get a path is not found error. 3) i thought i could live with the above 2 problems if it could just show my pictures. so i used a card reader to load .jpg files onto a cf card at 400x300 resolution. when i plugged the card into the frame these files show up as invalid when i try to view them. emailed coby with the 3 bullet points above got a response 30 hours later saying: coby tech support to me 5:25 am (3 hours ago) hello we have received your inquiry. it appears that your unit is defective. return the unit to the retailer for an exchange. what an inconvenience and disappointment. i will be buying a different product ",negative
" i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it. the price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out (displaying blue and green pixels). i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all. overall don't waste your time and money ",negative
" i've just returned this unit. it doesn't play videos as advertised. i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below. but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture. at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later. i have now had 3 different brands of 8 photo frames in my possession: a phillips a pandigital and this coby. i have developed the following list of features in my ideal photo frame. first video playback: i've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within/between chips and my computer is attractive. i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking (.mov more later) i'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is to play movie clips in show presentations intermixed with .jpg photo files. second feature is to play .wma music files in addition to mp3. this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player. all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3. third i would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning off at night for example. fourth i'd like an audio or speaker out feature. none of these frames has home theater-like sound and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i'd probably hook up. video out could come in handy too. fifth i'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame's software manually or automatically. yes you can rotate them in the computer but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation. (this may depend on which photo edit program you are using.) sixth i'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame's software. especially with the huge chips now available i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set (folder) rather than switching out chips. here is where the 3 units i've had stack up followed by my next (fourth) unit. i am keeping the pandigital....which costco has for $140. it plays .mov video files but not within a slideshow. it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny. it requires mp3 music files. it permits picture rotation. no folder management system. no clock/timer. no ability to play stills/video intermixed. i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok. the phillips didn't play video and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere. (no remote and no music with the philips either.) the coby won't play my videos even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations. the coby plays .wma music files won't rotate stills has no folder system no clock/timer. it has a speaker out jack. it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show. picture quality is fully equal to philips generally the recognized standard. if all you want is photos and never turn your camera sideways this unit will be a good value. another unit i'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci. i've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos.

" my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco. we put new batteries in that morning. the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset. when i tried to download the pictures to my computer they were all gone and the battery icon was flashing. based on what i've read here it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased. the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy. but what good is that when there aren't even any pictures the next day. i'm hoping the store will take it back ",negative

" this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market. after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures. the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download. it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child. the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up. even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver (the smallest one you can find) to achieve it. unfortunately i have wasted my money but luckily you don't have to ",negative
" first i want to defend this camera's lack of an lcd viewscreen--really unrealistic to expect something like that at this price point. what's wrong with this camera is that it tries to do so many different things that it doesn't do the one thing it needs to do well--i.e. take a picture with the push of a button. this product would be much better if you took out all the settings (what kid needs different resolution settings on a cheap camera for crying out loud?) and simply put in an auto-flash. as it is you must consult the manual push the mode button until you find the correct symbol for the flash (which is not intuitive so you'll need to carry the manual with you) press the shutter button to turn the flash on wait for the little red light to come on and then you can take a picture. then you shut it off or it goes off by itself after a very short period of inactivity and the next time you want to take a picture you have to do it all over again! oh and did i mention that it won't take a picture if there isn't enough light (there wasn't even in the brightest room in my house) so you must use the flash? clearly the makers of this product did not test it on real children. heck my digital camera is easier to use than this! we never even got to see the picture quality--after trying to get it to even take a picture i knew this was going back to the store asap ",negative
" this was a waste of money. my 5 year old loves taking photos. she uses my digital camera sometimes. i thought this would be a great gift for her. she could see the photos on the back of the camera like mom's. this was not the case. the lcd does not project the images and it is so small you can not read what mode you are in. if the batteries run out it erases the photos. i think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly. my daughter was frustrated quickly and it has laid in the drawer for 3 months. if your child likes to take photos i would invest in something else ",negative
" overall i was entirely disappointed with this camaera. the packaging and description were deceiving. there was no view finding screen only a teeny tiny window as in a regular camera. this was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera. i bought it because i wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen. the construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground. i would not recommend this to anyone ",negative

" this microphone is listed as a compatible accessory for the sony hdr-hc7 video camera on most websites including sonystyle. while the microphone may be of good quality (i didn't have an opportunity to thoroughly test it) it is only marginally compatible and a very poor choice for the hdr-hc7. the microphone does plug into the mic jack on the camera and appears to work but the shoe does not fit the hot shoe bracket on the camera. (note that there is no direct way to tell if it is actually working without playing the tape back at which point it's probably too late to make a correction.) after nearly an hour of very irritating chat room discussion and finally direct conversation with a sony technician i learned that there is a jury-rigged bracket that will allow you to attach the microphone near the camera on a tripod. otherwise there is no way to fix it to the camera. the sony technician finally admitted that it was curious that sony lists this as a compatible microphone. if you have a sony hdr-hc7 choose a different microphone! ",negative
" i ordered this mic after having to return the ecmhs1 (because it was in reality totally non-directional). well this one actually is directional but it is such a pain to use i wish i never bought it. 1st of all you should know this mic does not work with the smart shoe available on most sony camcorders - this means it will not receive any power from or transfer sound data to the camcorder through the shoe. therefore it is battery powered. this may seem like a minor problem but it means you need to remember to turn it on and off each time you video otherwise you will have either a soundless video or a dead battery. believe me at some point you will forget this. not being smart shoe compatible also means you have to plug the mic into a jack on the camcorder - this can be a real hassle if you have a small device and are trying to loop the cord around so it isn't in the way. (in my case the jack is under a rather cheap plastic cover that threatens to break off with repeated use.) (as you might expect i highly recommend you check whether a mic is smart shoe compatible. of course that means the mic doesn't need a battery or audio plug - not that it will simply fit into the shoe. it's a great feature.) finally while the engineers at sony have done some amazing things over the years they weren't able to do even a half-decent job designing the cap that covers this mic's battery. this cap will fall off with even the slightest touch. this can be incredibly annoying. mine fell off several times - fortunately i always managed to find it. i finally put a piece of duct tape on to secure it (doesn't look great but at least the color matches). considering the high cost this mic is a really bad investment. while the non-directional mics in most camcorders are pretty pathetic this is a very poor substitute.

" the panasonic is very compact very stylish sexy as my wife called it but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa. the colours are good and it does take very good videos but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. if one investigates such things will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi same as sony's canon improves this to 180 and nikon is at 300 dpi. it is not just about megapixels folks but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model do yourself a favour. try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format take the photos pop the sd card into the computer compare the images in photoshop. enlarge to full pixel size (100%) and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. that is what i did since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store but it was very educational for them too ",negative

" i bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the smartmedia (which only lasts for about a month). i would have to say that i am extremely disappointed particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the powershot sd1000 my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos. it's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. so blurry that i had to use photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. the right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable. maybe i simply got one with a bad lens. in any case no thanks i'll stick with my trusty old camera. i would rather pay for a new smartmedia card each month.

" the panasonic is very compact very stylish sexy as my wife called it but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa. the colours are good and it does take very good videos but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2. of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. if one investigates such things will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi same as sony's canon improves this to 180 and nikon is at 300 dpi. it is not just about megapixels folks but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi. so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model do yourself a favour. try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format take the photos pop the sd card into the computer compare the images in photoshop. enlarge to full pixel size (100%) and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. that is what i did since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d-lux3 10mp camera and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store but it was very educational for them too ",negative
" i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera. in the end it came down to panasonic's fx01 and cannon's sd600. i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic's images weren't top quality but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600. i was wrong. after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo. i really really wanted this camera to be great but it just wasn't. actually my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01! very disappointing. i ended up returning this camera to amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality. i mean wanting good photographs is why you take photos right? i know someone with the sd600 and he's very happy with the quality. judging by the customer images on the sd600's page on amazon i think i should've gone with cannon ",negative

" i was completely fooled. twice. my fiancee had told me she was getting me socks and underwear for christmas. so as i slowly open the box i see a pair of socks on top. there was more underneath so i start opening it further and there is a camera case a memory card and then finally at the bottom of the box the hp photosmart m525 digital camera! i was overjoyed at finally getting a digital camera of my own. no more borrowing from my sister when i needed to snap a few pictures. i put the memory card and batteries in and began taking some pictures. to put it bluntly ugh!!! the first thing that i noticed is that even in best picture mode the pictures were a little blurry/grainy even in the best of lighting conditions. the second thing that i noticed is that the pictures are distorted. there's a slight fisheye effect (imagine looking through a peep-hole on a door.) which is quite annoying. i talked to hp support (someone who spoke very poor english i might add. what is the deal with that?) and after about 45 minutes of discussion it was determined that the easiest thing for me to do was to go back to the store and exchange it for the same model. guess what? same problem! so after talking to hp once again i am returning this one and getting a different brand. this is a horrible product. my sisters kodak that i bought 3 years ago is a far superior product. i am very disappointed. hp needs to put out a better product and have some customer support reps that speak better english. it gets frustrating repeating yourself over and over again to be understood ",negative

" as an owner of the sony dcr-hc30 model dv handicam i want to warn everyone about my horrible experience with this product line. design and feature-wise these handicams are great. the problem is they are built like junk. from the day i opened my box i got a message that told me that the heads were dirty and needed to be cleaned. in retrospect i should have returned it for a replacement then and there. but being a basically optimistic guy i decided it just got dirty in transit and i got a head cleaner and cleaned the heads. it worked fine for about 30 days - just about the amount of time in sony's crappy labor warranty. and from that point forward i have gotten dirty head messages constantly which at first could be `cleaned away' but now even when the message is gone problems persist. i often get bars across the screen during playback and i have already determined that i have lost many a precious memory of my infant children. sony's solution to this situation is their standard flat rate repair program truly a bargain for $250 or so - more than half what i paid for the camera in the first place. and sony wonders why their brand value has all but disappeared? they are just another electronics brand now and one with sub-par quality and service at that. guess i'll be buying samsungs or canons next time around. are you listening sony?

" there is currently a known issue with many of the sony camcorders. this is being called the black screen of death. what happens is that the camera works great for 1-2 years then the ccd goes out like a light. the camera will not take video again. sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support. the fact is sony does not stand behind their product. if this happens to you sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars. there is a lengthy thread on cnet on this issue. search for sony black screen. wishing you luck in the purchase of your (not sony) video camera scot ",negative

" i have had this camera for about a year. it has been nothing but a problem. first the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems. i have spent hours trying to fix it. still has bugs in it no matter what i do. secondly the camera is very unreliable. i have a wedding to go to this weekend and i do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too. how do i explain the problems i have had? there are so many. the camera misfunctions continuously. sometimes it does nothing at all. other times the zoom lense will not shut. you turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option. i sometimes can not even shut the camera off i gotta take the batteries out to do so...if i can even find batteries that work in the camera. honestly i call tech supoport and told them the problems i have having and they tell me that only kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some. so i went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries. the camera salesman told me that kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter. i believe him. so my camera which would not work...i asked the salesman to help me out. it did not work with any lithium batteries.....reusable or rechargable. he popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked. well everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life. my camera now does not work with either batteries. probably only kodak batteries....maybe....or maybe kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me. i personally don't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good. really when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed. i am so anxious to get rid of this camera.....well would be but know i gotta fork over at least $250 on a good camera. trying to save money on this 'disposable' camera was a waste. stay away from kodak cameras! if you don't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews.

" i bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock. money thrown away!! the camera doesn't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk also in my opinion. it truly is junk now as i got so frustrated with it i threw it on the floor and smashed it. not kidding! when i first got iti called kodak and they told my son( who is knowledgeable in this stuff) how to reset the printer. we reset it and it worked for awhile. then it wouldn't work any more and i did away with it. no more kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked ",negative

" i bought this lens for my canon powershot g5 and because it requires the use of a long adapter not only does it cause terrible vignetting (that circle the other poster thought was cool but which is actually a design flaw) unless you zoom most of the way it blocks the built-in flash. i have owned four canon cameras over the past 15 years and the g5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment. (i would have bought the digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses but it didn't allow flash exposure compensation (insane for a $1000 camera body).) i do not recommend this lens or any of the g-series digital cameras from canon. when i've got the money i'll be buying the latest digital rebel and upgrading some of my old eos lenses and selling my entire powershot kit. if you are an experienced photographer you will not like this system at all ",negative

" i bought this to replace my broken digital8 sony camcorder and the same sales guy who sold me the sony 6 years ago advised me to buy this jvc on one single criterion: the near-infinite hard disk drive storage. this was almost the only claim that was actually fulfilled. summary: infinite recording time disappointing image quality and control for the price painful editing. not for the average imovie user. positive points: - the storage capacity: a dream. i thought that 7 hours of high-quality video would barely last two weeks of vacation. actually it took me months to fill them. mostly because as with digital cameras you can throw away all the bad takes at will. i decided i'd keep all my previous good takes until i really would need the space well... i still have my best clips from 5 months ago in the camcorder which means that i can always show them at friends and family on location even if i don't have my computer or dvd copies on me. - the size weight and shape: perfect. you can take this camcorder anywhere without facing hard packing decisions. it's small feels rather rugged. i added a wide-angle lens and the bigger optional battery which makes the camera 50% bulkier but still manageable. the shape is great at least for my hand size. i can really grab the camera properly in various situations of verticality and bumpiness... the microphones are not that well placed though and i often cover them with my fingers. - image stabilization: very good. by chance i shot a clip with my wide-angle lens in the way which gave me a good fixed reference to see how the beast is fast and smooth at correcting unwanted shakiness. - ease of connection: the usb2 link is ok. i'd have preferred firewire but here we are not dealing with video streams but video files. btw this allows faster-than-real-time transfer. a firewire link with the camcorder acting as a hard disk would have been great... ok points: user interface reaction time (even if it takes a long time to get ready) optics battery life (with the 3 hour batt. - actually a 1.5 hours). negative points : - image quality: considering the price image quality is disappointing. frankly. the viewfinder is flattering but color saturation is in fact low and clips shot on sunny days seem sadder than they are as i found out after shooting for a whole week in yucatan. clips shot on my digital camera (canon ixus 60) look better. there is also a lack of control on image quality. - digital camera: simply forget it. my phone takes better pictures. i'd advise you to buy a 2mpix+ cellphone and enjoy the benefit of sending your pics and videos immediately to far-away family and pals. - file transfer and editing: pretty horrible with the originally supplied software. in marketing copy mpeg2 files might seem nice as a target format but we always have to edit our videos and this is quite painful whatever power-users might tell you. you are in for hours of conversion except if you burn your raw takes at the risk of boring your audience. i was going to write don't buy this if you are a mac user. this is not imovie ready. i have both pcs and macs it's equally painful and disappointing except if you buy yourself a real video editing suite. still if you have a mac and an everio get yourself the wonderful mpeg streamclip free utility from squared 5. it allows batch conversion of the everio .mod files into useable formats. you'll have to buy the mpeg2 component from apple first and change the .mod extensions to .mpg prior to conversions. time- and disk-space-consuming but worth it as the image quality is superior to the one generated by the jvc-supplied software. neat thing: leave your computer at home though you can't use the camcorder as an external hard disk (it is write-protected) you can copy the photographs from the sd card to the hard-disk which means that with the everio you wont need to bring your computer on a trip just to store the pictures from your digital camera. conclusion: given the choice i won't buy this camcorder mainly for the below-par image quality as i'm ready to cope with the complications of conversion and editing. but i'd seriously miss the storage capacity ",negative

" this camcorder is terrible in just about every way: cons: - unacceptably blurry video; the specs say it records at 640x480 but it looks more like 320x240 (if that!) blown up to vga. - noticeable aura around any dark shape on a lighter background. - awful light sensitivity; forget about recording indoors--no matter how brightly the room is lit faces will come out too dark. the built-in led's don't help much (and not at all at distances over 4 feet from the subject). - noisy zoom that gets picked up loud and clear by the microphone. - zooming goes in irregular steps--completely useless while recording. - video lags noticeably behind camera movement; when image stabilization is turned on the lag becomes so atrocious that you can't tell when to stop panning--utterly useless! - when using av-in and av-out cables the firmware has frozen on me a couple of times; the only way to reset the camera was to remove the battery. - video encoding (through the av-in cable) produces an unacceptably noisy and undersaturated result. - the lcd display has a very narrow viewing angle; anything more than about 10% and you can't make out a thing. - still photos taken at the native 5mp resolution come out strangely grainy and uneven--something like a sharpen effect gone wrong. i can get better looking pictures with my 2mp canon powershot a40 camera. - the manual recommends keeping the camera motionless for 2-3 seconds after snapping a picture (that's on top of the 3-4 seconds it takes the thing to focus before it snaps); but you can't keep the subject from moving folks! welcome to the psychedelic land of image trails... - flash photos come out with wildly different color balance depending on the color of the background. - the manual is a sorry affair--only 17 pages long and doesn't go much beyond identifying external controls and menu options. - i could go on and on but i'll stop now as you probably get the picture... pros: - the camera body seems sturdily built; the controls also have a sturdy feel to them as do the battery and the usb port covers. hmm... it's the only nice thing i can think to say about it. maybe a child (think pre-teen) could find this camcorder exciting as a toy but i don't see how it can be enough even for an undemanding person looking to capture occasional life's moments on video ",negative

" i believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. forget about zoom lenses even if they are l. this lens is far better than 70-200l in my opinion. it is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. with zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens. it is very well built but not excessive heavy come with hood and bag but unfortunately canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the l lenses. combined with a tamron 1.4x teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom l lenses at 189mm focal length. yes i know i lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens. but i am really happy that i decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200is to 135/2l+1.4x. this not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures especially at wide open. better portrait lenses like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8 would cost several thousands of dollars. trust me once you play with primes you will not like zoom anymore. i am also using a 24-70l to shoot my small kid. after using this lens i don't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6x crop factor of digital camera. a 35mm/1.4l will become 56mm which is really not good. order from amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock. they shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated in stock soon. pros: very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5. very fast lens with f/2 very good bokeh (background blurring). overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color. smaller size less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s. it is a l lens: best build quality fast/quiet ring usm af with ftm. cons: no hard case. no inexpensive. effective focal length is 216mm on 10d/20d/rebel/300d which is a little difficult to use for portrait ",positive
" i recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my digital rebel xl. my worries were needless: just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that i have. when attached to my eos elan 7n film camera however the lens really truly comes into its own as the full frame 35mm slr delivers the entire focal range of this lens. the focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-l grade lens. and i agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it like the l lenses have. this glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money. solidly built too with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it. i highly recommend it ",positive
" the controls are a little complicated to get used to especially the all-manual settings -- which should by definition be easy to use -- but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable. after i bought it i took the d10 to budapest hungary. i had a great view of the danube and set my camera up for night shots. it did a brilliant job. how about this: take a digital night shot (use the largest image size possible) use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through shutterfly.com. image remained amazingly sharp. colors were fantastic. the camera made it easy to look like a pro. the only gripe i have with this camera is that i wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive canon digitals but this can be overcome with software so it's not a huge issue. the price is great it has a magnesium body (vs. the rebel's plastic body). you get a lot of the d1/d20/d30 without the cost ",positive
" this is one of the four cameras the only digital camera i used to learn portrait photography. the class was on how to take portraits not how to use the camera. i wanted to graduate from the point and shoot but had to consider my budget because i wanted an slr film camera also. i got the canon rebel ti packed with two lenses. it made sense to me to purchase a canon digital to interchange lenses. my original choice was the canon digital rebel however in my web search i found the eos 10d for $750 with no catch. there were no required additional purchases scam when i called. this allowed me to spend the extra money i would have spent on the camera on accessories. since it's digital i am not shy about trying out the features. when i first got the camera some of the photos were dark or very light. after tinkering around and learning what the sensor-indicators means i don't get that anymore. the 10d is more camera than i need that i'm sure i will have it for a long time.

" this is a good affordable uv filter for protecting your expensive lenses. i leave it on my lens all the time. this particular filter (l-39 sharp cut) is especially good for wide angle lenses (&lt; 24mm focal length) because of its ultrathin profile which prevents vignetting. i have used regular filters on wide angle lenses with very bad results. although this filter is not multi-coated i have not found it to be a big deal in the pictures i've taken. multi-coated uv filters can cost 2x or 3x the price of this one which i don't think is worthwhile. all in all i recommend this filter for canon or non-canon lenses ",positive
" this is a very powerful flash unit that works as a master to other canon flash units. you can get very nice results with a small amount of experimentation. it does what it suppose to. i used it with the 420ex i've had for several years and it worked fine. mounted on the camera it's a larger version of the built in popup on the 30d with some extra niceties and lots more power. thinking of the 430ex? cough up the few extra bucks for this baby you'll be glad you did. it's a one shot deal [no pun intended] you'll be using it for years to come. i bought the 420ex for my elan ii e about 6 years ago. it's been a great unit. this one recharges faster and has gobs more power. you'll love it! don't let all the dials and switches scare you read the instruction manual ",positive
" i didn't have a ton of time to research this flash. i've used it now on several occasions with my canon 5d and couldn't be happier with it. it's great for shooting portraits. i can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up. i would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser - get's rid of the typical flash harsh light ",positive
" i'm very happy with my speedlite 580ex is a new dimension for my photographic hobb ",positive
" i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work. when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with. unless you are going for a very shadowy high-contrast image this diffuser can save the day. it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind. sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences ",positive

" when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery. they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes. now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good business choice. so i said no. so i got the camera charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh i also got a 2g cf) worked great....so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots. keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase. well 6000' 300 pictures and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong still have 200 shots left for the trip home battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button. so all in all i think the battery life is great now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point the original will work fine. as for the quality of photos.....i love them ",positive

" this is a great camera. plenty of resolution. excellent shot speed. sturdy frame. the kit lense doesn't do the camera justice. buy the body separate and add a better lense. on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix. it was two months before the camera was returned. sorry canon... you lose a star for that ",positive
" i have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3.1m for the last few years to the canon 20d now what a pleasure to shot. the battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots which should be sufficient for most anybody. there is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera. the lens choice was a great idea which came from an earlier review of the excellent walk around ability of this lens from the general shots to the closeups of those favorite flowers. for those individuals who are on the fence about this product i tout it to all i have spoken to. it turned a good photo experience on our west coast road trip into a real serious photo shoot it also uses the commonly accessable compact flash. the built in flash works well have not had to explore the options at this time. the delivery of this item when promised was a nice bow on the package ",positive

" i shoot with a canon 20d and have used the canon ef 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 iii usm lens. i've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball. i reviewed the lens lineup at the canon website and decided on the canon ef 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6l usm lens. the 100-400mm is a great lens but it can be a bit soft. for that reason i decided to add the canon ef 70-200mm 2.8/f is usm telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection. this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers. being an l lens there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance. the construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups. the four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration. an improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image. the canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs/1470 g and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft/1.3 m. this lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x ii and 2x ii. be sure to get a good quality uv haze filter to protect the front lens element. being white this lens looks a bit strange but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun. some people are concerned that being white it attracts attention to criminals. from my experience my 20d attracts attention regardless of what lens i put on it. in addition i most likely have a camera bag and tripod/monopod with me to further attract attention. i personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload. i try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up. the dual is system has two modes. mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects. it is recommended that the is function is not used on a tripod; however i have used it on my monopod with success. the is helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle. while there are limitations to what the is can do it can give you a few extra stops. just keep in mind the is attempts to eliminate camera movement not the movement of the subject being photographed. this lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set. there is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m/4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m/8.2ft to infinity. included with this lens are the tripod mount lens hood and storage case. the tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod. this helps to balance the load. mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over. the case is a zippered soft case (lz1324) that can also be purchased separately. the lens hood (et-86) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations. often times amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood however they are normally included with the lens. the canon ef 70-200mm is such an awesome lens it almost fails to compare to the canon ef 75-300mm. the canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm is lens is more refined. the auto-focus is quiet and quick. this lens can be used for portraits landscape sports or as a general walk about lens. the f/2.8l combined with the is makes this a good option for certain low light situations. the features add creative versatility. the canon ef 70-200mm is lens comes at a price but it is worth every bit of it. pros: incredible clarity and sharpness quiet and quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual is system cons: heavy and bulky (this should be expected with these types of lenses ",positive
" nick xu if you can't figure out the difference between this lens and the cheaper consumer grade lenses by all means stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses. after all mr magoo of cartoon fame couldn't tell a chevy from a rolls royce. all kidding aside this lens is simply awesome in use. having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses. yes it's that good. i am using a borrowed version right now but as soon as i pay off my new 24-105 f/4 l is usm lens (very very awesome) i will buy my own 70-200 f/2.8 is usm. it's as good as it gets in this lens range but if you feel comfortable with a pinhole camera carry on as it's all about the end user. for everyone else this lens is the holy grail of mid range telephoto lenses. it is simply the best available in it's range and responds well to canon tele adapters. if you can figure out a way to afford this lens buy it as it is all that. if you are a nikon lover buy this lens anyway and buy a fairly cheap 20d body to make it work. it's ok to tell your friends that you used a nikon to take the pics but you will end up knowing that canon is the premeir lens crafter of the 21'st century.

" i upgraded from the canon digital rebel (grey body) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level. one thing i like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall ",positive
" hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image or the appearance of lens flare. shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. a hood is not required to eliminate these problems as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. the hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. this hood being a solid petal shaped offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. when in place the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. being shallow and petal shaped this type of protection is also limited. even if the protection is limited replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing the lens and easier to replace. this hood is manufactured for the canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 is ef and normally is not included with the lens when sold new. amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens and is worth considering. since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. this doesn't add to the length of the lens but does make it wider by about an inch. an inch may not seem like a lot but in a tightly packed camera bag it is huge. this lens itself isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem. while the protective benefits exist they are secondary and limited. i find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case) purchasing a hood is money well spent. pros: improves contrast and image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection to the lens cons: takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens ",positive

" this is a wonderful bag for the photographer that wants a light weight bag that can still hold a lot of lenses or bodies. the bag slings around to the front allowing the user to easily switch out lenses without having to unload the entire bag or worry about dropping an expensive lense. also the bag can hold a lot of accessories. i had to canon rebel xt bodies and 3 lenses in just the camera compartment. the flap that opens up to the user when the bag is on your chest has the memory card holder but it hold 8 memory cards which is huge! the top has a small pouch where you can tuck away larger objects like a water bottle or map. the all weather bag cover is built into the bag so you do not have to worry about folding it up and storing it. the bag cover also has velcro pulls that latches it onto the bag so that it stays on insuring a dry environment inside the bag. basically this is a top notch bag that can get through anything. yes i have actually used the bag on a few trips and find it very user friendy and reasonable ",positive
" the case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only. then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses. it makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera. you can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack. my digital rebel xt fits with the canon battery grip and my macro lens attached however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached. my canon speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag. the lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them. i bought a regular lowepro camera bag but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached. this bag is designed to have the camera with a lens. if you search google images for the lowepro slingshot 200 you will see what i mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal.

" this uv filter does it job to protect the lens well. the build is solid (metal construction). the glass is also descent quality. about the performance it absorbs some uv light. the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable probably the sky 1-a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me. now about the one problem which is the internal reflection. i've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). to put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand) when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture) the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). and if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time a lamp at nightime is often very bright. but the point that i'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. additionally the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). i'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens. and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet.

" my all-around favorite lens in the canon eos system is the 50/1.4. i find that most of the time most of the pictures i want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light. i bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens as a lot of my pictures weren't in particularly dark places and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing. i was not disappointed. the image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding. great color great sharpness. it might not make images quite as striking as canon's 135/2 lens but they are very good indeed. does this lens replace the 50/1.4? no way. the 50 is a lot smaller weighs a lot less and is still much better for low light shooting. but for photographing events where you don't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better the 24-70 can be a great tool ",positive
" just returned from a trip to hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test. i was very pleased with the results. this is a powerful lens yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use. i was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (canon eos 20d) and virtually every shot was a keeper. the is feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus. usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one. i shot in both portrait and landscape mode and i didn't see any problems with focus clarity or sharpness. all the images were clean and razor sharp. if you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment i highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.

" i purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x. just keep in mind--1.4x is only 40% better. it worked really well but didn't increase the zoomage enough. i decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead. i gave this one to my brother-in-law for christmas. you have to think about what you want--i want to get in really close to the birds. i have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm. it is an improvement but not nearly enough! if you want to get twice as close this isn't going to do it for you. if you want to get half-again-as close this almost gets you there. as far as quality the quality is definitely there. five stars for quality 3 for insufficient zoomage ",positive
" i was able to use the canon ef 1.4x ii extender for some nature photography recently in wyoming. i shot elk in low light conditions so i was shooting pretty much wide open. the extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all. you could see the hairs on the animals heads. it's fantastic ",positive

" ive gotten used to the disposable kodaks i got from the checkout isle at walmart. the problem with those though is that they run out of pictures pretty quick. the last straw was when we ran out of film at the family reunion just as cousin billy was about to show us how to catch a lizard with a rubber band and a twinky. at that point i knew i needed an upgrade. i ordered the canon eos-1ds mark ii the next day for [...] the feature that first caught my attention was the powerful zoom. now when i take a family picture i like to step back about a mile or two then zoom in and snap that high-resolution masterpeice. my wife always complains that i zoom too close into the big pores on her nose to which i respond by suggesting she use clean and clear pore cleansing strips (watch for her upcoming review of those soon). another useful feature of this camera is the continuous shooting mode. this is where the camera automatically takes pictures in rapid succession about 5 per second. the other day i set the camera on the dresser turned on the macarena and got wild. i then took the individual pictures and strung them together into an animated flipbook. now watching myself do the macarena is a mere flip of the book away. man i can dance. to summarize you will have a lot of fun with this cam like i did. definitely worth the [...] ! but remember there is a [...] that comes with it; so make sure you fill in the item number clearly on the [...] card and make sure you stay within the space alloted on the form otherwise the [...] wont go through ",positive

" if you've found these reviews you already know this lens is one of the best canon products out there. i did not bite on the is version and i have not found myself ever wishing i did; this lens is everything it's hyped up to be and performs well in low-light/indoor situations. i don't think it's weight is that big a deal. i really don't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day -- in my hands or in a bag -- even with a 1.4 extender attached. it can feel a bit heavy but i don't mind and neither will you when you see the results later on. i've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it's landed me front page ink several times. in my mind i could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography considering the 300 f/2.8 and it's friends are much much more expensive. the lens works basically just as fast and sharp in my opinion with the 1.4 at f/4 although some may debate this. flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro. if you can swing the price enjoy it! my advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products although i found most everyone agreed this is one of the finest lens around. it's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are ",positive

" i bought the rebel xt w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the xti was introduced but that's another story. as this is my first dslr i was blown away by the results. but after the initial euphoria there is always room for improvement. my first choice was the 28-200 favoring the longer zoom over the is but i found this one used at penn camera and got a deal on it and a 380ex flash so the decision was made for me. i like the zoom range it's great for framng portraits. if i need wider angle i still have the kit lens. i won't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes as i was prepared for this by these reviews before i ever saw the lens. i'm no expert on sharpness and still trying to get myself dialed in but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me. i have no l lenses to compare to nor would i make the comparison if i did. in my somewhat uninformed opinion this is a great step up from the kit lens. this is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with. being a working guy i'm extremely happy with it so far and glad i made the purchase.

" i had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the canon eos1. as exploration health safety & environment advisor work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans. the wait was for 35mm film quality with speed of picture taking (5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the eos 1 was desired). there was a parallel wait for an image stabilised 28-300 zoom lens. let's cut the story short. if i want a camera to bring on holiday it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky; instead i would choose the eos20d without hesitation. but having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames i decided not to wait any longer but to buy the eos1d mark ii because the 1ds mark ii is not fast enough at 4 frames a second. with 35mm cameras after a few seconds on the shooting i would have to run back inside to the cabin (of a ship) to change film. if there is large enough memory card in the eos1dii there is no need. this camera is built with seals against the environment (and so does the 28-300mm lens). instead of being scared of running out of film now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning (and hoping) the dolphins do their jumps into the air. with the 28-300mm lens attached there is no need to change lenses either. dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting. it is a disappointment that the battery is not lion but the older nimh. but as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare whatever the substance. i just wish canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky. it has connections for two batteries (yet it could only charge one following the other) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged. you just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit binoculars laptop mobile phone gps.......ext. hard disk....as hand luggage. for work i am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware. but for holidays i would choose the eos20d with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod? the camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down. why just 4.5 stars ? one of the beauties i had thought with digital slr was not having to do anything in processing just transfer the images to the computer. wrong. the .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough. post processing is required. why ? why is that necessary when the canon s60 (which i use for different assignments (with underwater housing)) doesn't need to ? that defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 meg when the 1.5 meg of the s60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? still there is raw if the standard output is not suficient. incidentally the eos1dsii also produces 5.5 meg .jpg and those also require post processing. for those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary (me) 16.7 million pixels would seem a bit wasted. i am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film. meantime i shall have to learn to shoot with raw files and post process. also incidentally the sensor size of the eos20d is smaller which means although itself is lighter than the eos1d series camera having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday. the magnification ratio for the eos1dii is 1.3 whereas the eos20d is 1.6. this means i could still travel reasonably light (compromise) with the 1dii and 28-135mm is lens attached. sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious. any regrets ? none what-so-ever. it is state of the technology at the moment. another benefit of using digital is that it doesn't matter if you had been shooting iso 100 all day. come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop just change to iso 1600 without having to bother about pushing2 the film in developing. it's a beauty when an is l lens is attached. you'd need is when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! good job canon. now you need to shoe horn in a more capable cpu (to process the images in-camera) fit the 1dsii sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1dsii and you may persuade me to part with more cash.

" many great things have already been said about this lens and i will support them! my copy delivers outstanding sharpness (nearly on par with my 24-70l) even *wide open* (rare for a wide angle of all but the finest german manufacturers) great color very little distortion (many objective tests have revealed that it's probably the best of breed ultra wide angle) and impressive contrast. surprisingly the build quality is not bad: tight fitting mount damped rings and no jiggles or rattles. if i were forced to offer a (slight) negative it would be the bokeh of the lens is somewhat marbly...however when shooting a subject with an oof area differential high enough to make bokeh a component of the frame then the subject is likely going to demand far more attention than the bokeh! ;) a fine lens canon: definitely worth the premium over the sigma and tokina rivals (both of which i sampled before purchasing this optic) ",positive

" i bought this lens to go with my canon digital rebel xt. i absolutely love this lens. i got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well. with some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot. i read the other reviews and must say that i have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before. and i have taken countless insect shots with this lens. it is a bit louder than the other lenses i have but i don't see it to be a problem. the one problem i do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower. when this happens i just flip it to manual and focus that way. no big deal. overall great lens for an even greater price. definitely worth it. (i submitted a photo of a bee that i took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example.) ",positive
" i purchased this lens back in march of 2005 to shoot static warhammer models with my 10d. i found that longer lenses such as the sigma 105mm the canon ef 100mm and the tamron sp autofocus 90mm all were too long with the 10d's 1.6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what i had room for to get the shot. the canon ef 50mm f/2.5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10d for this purpose. its small its compact and its short focal length do not require that i be standing three feet away from the model i'm shooting. as far as shooting at non-static objects such as insects the lens is slow to focus and loud in both noise and vibration which results in startled subjects and missed shots. the same also applies for non-macro shots as well. its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well ",positive
" this is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier canon digital elph that i lost several years ago. the 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality and the 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures. in fact the digital zoom also works great - just make sure the camera is steady (i purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome). although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have you can't beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes. the canon sd500 is a great little camera ",positive

" hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image or the appearance of lens flare. shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. a hood is not required to eliminate these problems as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. the hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image. photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. this hood being a solid conical two inch long offers some protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. there is nothing more irritating than reviewing your images to find dust spots or other flaws. when in place the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing or replacing a lens. this hood is manufactured for the canon 85 f/1.8 usm ef 100 f/2.0 usm ef 135 f/2.8 usm ef 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 usm ef lenses and normally is not included with the lens when sold new. amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens and is worth considering. since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. this doesn't add to the length of the lens but does make it wider by about an inch. an inch may not seem like a lot but in a tightly packed camera bag it is huge. fortunately canon provides a storage case with the lens that can be used in addition to your camera bag. while the protective benefits exist they are secondary and limited. i find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood. considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case) purchasing a hood is money well spent. pros: improves contrast and image quality offers limited protection to the lens cons: takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the len ",positive
" i bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 mark i (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that i purchased recently. canon specs the discontinued es-65 hood for this lens. the great thing about this et-65iii is that it is longer so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs. the interior on this mark iii version is also flocked providing a bit more light absorption. i've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college but this hood is definitely worth the investment: well built fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera) and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep). note that this will not fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 mark ii version (all plastic mount with no distance scale) ",positive
" the power-2000 xp-333 charges batteries in pairs with one led per pair not as described. the xp-555 charges each battery independently and slightly faster (3 vs 4 hours). the xp-333 charger is very lightweight the xp-555 is slightly heavier. they work on 110 or 220 v and includes plug adaptors for round european type plugs. i have used the xp-333 in the usa and overseas. power-2000 makes several other charger models as well. the xp-333 and 555 aas are 2500 mah and there are xp-33327 and xp-55527 versions now available with 2700 mah batteries. aaa batteries charge faster as they hold less charge. aaas from power-2000 currently come in 850 and 1000 mah capacities. i believe that these capacities for aa and aaa from power-2000 and other nimh makers are twice as great or maybe more than alkalines. as i recall some years ago duracell copper top aas have 1100 mah. i have not found recent figures on the web but got the old figure by calling the 800 number on the duracell packages. duracell ultras appear to have a bit higher mah figure but i do not know that that is. the 1.2 v for nimh vs 1.5 v for alkalines seems to make no practical difference as i am told and i believe it is correct that alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 v after initial use while i understand that the nimh holds its 1.2 v value for some time.

" this lens has gotten some bad reviews i think partly because it is starting to show it's age. this was the first usm is lens and the technology has really grown since then. if canon were to come along with an updated 75-300 usm is lens man it would blow everything away. that being said yes this lens is a little slow to focus. but if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games you should be okay. it also could use an extra stop (or two or three!) because when you are handholding you need that aperture to be as open as it can be. all of this aside i really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens. it lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for. if you have asteady hand and plently of availible light you can get some really nice shots. if you are in a low light situation... you will need a tripod. the is of lens works... pretty good but i have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that wouldn't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with. all in all its a good starter telephoto lens especially for digital slrs since it really extends the zoom on those. its great for the price and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon l beauties just sell it ",positive

" when digital cameras first came out i like many people swore i'd always be loyal to film. digital could never take the place of film. i'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely. there's still something i love about putting a roll of film in the camera shooting away sending the film to be processed and seeing the results. i also know it's a bit expensive. i know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion but digital cameras are improving in this regard and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital slr and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera. so i figured now is the time to get a digital slr. i have been a loyal nikon user for nearly ten years and have owned the nikon n60 n70 and n80. my first love was and still is the n70 (i've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought i was the only person who loved the n70). i purchased the n80 only after my n70 cost too much to repair but i've enjoyed the way my various nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if i don't have the time to use specific controls but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes. my nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes wildlife shots and all sorts of other things i can't resist to capture forever. i decided to purchase the d70 since it was close to what i've already experienced with nikon. in many ways it works in a similar way to the n70 and 80 except it's a digital rather than film version. like the film versions of the midrange nikon slr's it has a dial that allows an automatic setting portrait landscape sports close-up nightscape and night portrait modes the ability to select aperture shutter speed or manual controls. the camera has auto and manual focus abilities. photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires. the controls are easy to use though it takes practice to be comfortable. on a personal level the camera has passed the halloween test niece's birthday test and fall foliage in new england test and favorite scenic spots test. the only real difficulty i've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting. auto focus has not worked at all and i'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots but at this point i'm sure it's the photographer and not the camera. i do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera. the manual is very confusing. it uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else. i've had luck with the magic lantern guides with my other cameras but have not as of yet used it for this camera. i did purchase the nikon d70 field guide (david busch wiley publishing) which has been helpful. it can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography. ",positive
" i have owned this camera for about two months now and have taken about 100 photographs (keepers) to date. because i have been involved in photography for almost 35 years i have developed certain prejudices. in particular i have never been comfortable with auto exposure and even less comfortable with auto focus. in fact the last auto focus camera i owned was a nikon n8008s that i ultimately sold at auction because i could not adapt to using the various auto settings. however i like this camera. why? the d70s is a very easy camera to use and i have only had to refer to the manual to check on a couple of settings and look up some features. honestly set up takes only a few minutes and handling is not terribly different from a film camera. i should point out that this camera is really designed for auto focus lenses and if you choose to use your manual focus lot you will disable many of the camera's features. because i am both stubborn and cheap (but mostly only when it comes to spending money on myself) i am using my manual focus lenses on this camera. it is true that i do not get any internal exposure meter readings and must rely on a handheld gossen or the sunny 16 rule (quite effective really) for exposure determination. the lcd preview screen thus is critical for determining or adjusting exposure. i should also point out that the depth of field preview feature is also lost when using manual focus lenses. i was stunned when i could not stop my lens down and burrowed through the manual to find out what i was doing wrong--which was nothing except that i was using the wrong type of lens. while i really miss this feature i am not sure how big a loss it really is because of the viewfinder. others have made mention of the low magnification and tunnel like views through the finder and i can attest to this fact. i compared finder views to my trusty old fm and was just stunned by how poorly the d70 compared. ultimately the best camera is the camera you use and the d70 has become my camera of choice. even though i am using this camera like a vintage m series leica--i.e. handheld meter and presetting exposure in anticipation of a photograph--i find that i can live with this level of usability. at some point i will probably buy an auto focus lens (maybe the 35 f2) and make full use of the feature set. but for now i content on using the camera the old fashioned way ",positive
" other than the months of waiting for nikon to deliver them to amazon for shipping the battery itself in a good deal. they work well charge up easy and hold their charge nicely. priced well they cost less than the same type battery than canon or sony. i bought them for a d80 and the older en-el3a would not fit. of course i had 10 of the older batteries for my d70s and was rather surprised when they didn't fit the d80. basically the same size and shape but keyed differently. i was also surprised to find the 3e would fit in the d70s meaning they are backward compatable.

" i switched from the digital rebel xt. since i already had l-glass lenses i didn't run into problems with the 5d exposing cheaper lenses. the 17-40mm really shines on the full sensor! the burst rate is simply astonishing. missing flash doesn't bother me heck it's a $3000 camera i don't expect a built-in flash. i have the speedlite 580ex which of course is wonderful in itself. i also have the battery grip which i recommend as well as the rs-80n3 cable release. image quality is superb overall - the 5d really shines in high iso numbers - more so than even the 1d from what i've read. even at 1600 there's hardly any noise. it allows you to take great crisp photos in low light where other cameras would require a flash. the camera also is quite light while being very sturdy at the same time. the 3 fps might bother some but i prefer the incredible burst numbers.

" there are no professionals or would-be professional photographers in our house. instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family. we're not particularly interested in birds flowers bugs race cars etc. we want to catch our kids doing what they love best; football basketball swimming band golf... my only advantage is that i am very experienced with adobe photoshop which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots. this year our son is a high-school senior. instead of buying an expensive portrait package we voted to spend the money on a canon digital rebel xt kit (with lens). we choose one extra zoom lense (the 75-300mm f4-5.6 iii usm telephoto) for up-close action sports shots. we didn't chose the is lens because it was out of our price range. we are having great fun with this camera and lens. we have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic' sports setting on the camera (burst mode at full zoom). they are great - crisp and clear. these have been taken in full sun. we realize that we'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations. but i think we can do it. i would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots. they might not be professional quality but they are just what we wanted ",positive

" i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it or have already bought it--it's size. it is amazingly small it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera. i take it with me everywhereliterally it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket and i don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. there is also a small covering for the lens so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched. the picture quality surprised me when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but i was wrong! the picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration). however i do have a few things to complain about... first off the battery. this camera uses a lithium battery i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there. not only is it inconvenient but also the battery life span is short. the longest i've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes. this isn't uncommon in cameras though just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries you should be fine. another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function. such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong! very wrong. the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet. even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little resulting in a noisy start-up. the flash is very weak. really dissapointing. if you are inside you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room. the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function. the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject. to make matters work there is no manual override to overcome this problem. the focus is great though if you are not taking a macro shot. these are all the flaws i found in the camera it's not my first choice in cameras i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size. if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times then this is a great camera choice.

" pros: - reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. better to break the hood than the front element. - makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. cons: - will increase lens movement in windy situations kind of like a sail on a boat. - takes up more room in your bag even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - people take more notice of you will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile ",positive
" i received my 28-200 yesterday from amazon. having read the customer reviews i immediately put my rebel xt on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my canon 28-135 is. three shots each at f-stops 5.6 11 and 20 one set indoors at iso 1600 and the other outdoors at iso 200. focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera highest jpeg setting. after shooting both series i compared them fresh out of the camera side by side. results: the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances. it was visibly sharper at iso 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20 (the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10) and at 20 it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background. the 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise. both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in photoshop. there are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider; different test scenes conceivably produce different results. my conservative conclusion: the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your canon (unless you are going to drop $2200 on the l series 28-300 is and carry it) and the 28-135 is has no clear sharpness advantage. between these lenses its a tradeoff---an extra 65 mm of focal length (105 mm after a 1.6 conversion) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability. both lenses focus quickly and silently and both lenses produce usable shots.

" i love the new digital canon. the only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin. i had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working. the canon people have been great and very helpful but i'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory. the photos however are wonderful. film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.

" when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery. they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes. now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good business choice. so i said no. so i got the camera charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh i also got a 2g cf) worked great....so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots. keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase. well 6000' 300 pictures and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong still have 200 shots left for the trip home battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button. so all in all i think the battery life is great now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point the original will work fine. as for the quality of photos.....i love them ",positive

" if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye. this 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor. if you love the fish eye style and have that camera you'll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip. i was disapointed with this lens for that reason. the sigma 8mm is great. a note to the reviewer below. sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones. this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy. it happens often enough with sigma gear. with this lens its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want. bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out. decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy. i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge. sounds like you got a bad one ",positive
" i have not actually taken this underwater yet but it appears to be well made and of similar quality to other cases. it keeps the over-all size of the camera/case down to a size that could fit into a bc pocket. on the downside it does have only limited functionality of the camera through the available buttons. you can zoom and telephoto change from cameraplayback and to movie mode and shoot the picture. you cannot do any of the setup functions while it is in the case. regarding a stobe sony makes one that looks a little cheezy. there is a universal strobe by sea life (sl 960d) that fits but the fiber-optic trigger is just taped onto the flash of the camera. i'm waiting to how this works. one replacement o-ring comes with the case-replacements from sony were outrageously expensive. color-correcting (red) lenses are about $100 from sony but not needed if you use a strobe.

" i started with a d50 and have loved it from the very begining. i felt ready to step up to the next level but didn't think i was ready for the d200. when i heard about the d80 i read everything i could. the biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body. i don't use all of the mode setting and find myself in shutter and aperture priority most of the time but it's nice to have the others there when i don't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings. the in camera image enhancements are amazing--but a word of caution. vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots--if not too much so. i've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years. compared to the canon 30d (which i was thinking about) or even the new 400d (i haven't actually held one yet) this is the nikon to have. on batter life i had a recent shoot where i took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period. the battery was at about half and that's with quite a bit of lcd viewing. at this level both canon and nikon offer great equipment--you can't go wrong with either. just get one of each in your hands snap a few shots and go with the one that feels the best for you ",positive
" after way too much time infront of a pc reading reviews or a camera store counter (damn i was sick of it) this d80 is what i chose. bought it 2 weeks ago and then went on a 10 day trip west. after draging it everywhere i has not let me down. for the price its perfect. i'm still working out exactly how to make it work to its potential aswell as fighting understanding of other manufacturers camera layouts in my head) at work i have a rebel xt i bought last year as i need its compact casing. my brother has the canon d30 after he progressed from the xt and a friend on the west coast has the d200. having experience both i still love what i chose. my biggest reason however for going again with nikon was that i already have a n6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was i could use its nikkor af 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options. after reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop i found it worked fine. experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens. the 2.5 inch lcd is sooo much easier to read than the rebel xt. the info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the lcd on the xt (if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and i can't see through the viewfinder myself i certainly can't see the info screen if its below it). i didn't go with the 18-135 in the end for a lens as there is a vinyetting issue at the high end which bothered me. i got a great deal for the same price at cameraland in new hampshire for the d80 and the (d70s) 18-70mm tried and trusted lens. fab. now need to save up and wait for the release of the 80-300 vr lens thats coming out. would love the 80-400 vr but its 3 times the price. my hardest time was finiding someone with it in stock at a price i wanted to pay the set up i wanted and who wasn't trying to make a dodgie deal (like some of those cheap web based places in nyc).it really was the hardest part of the purchase in the end. i was surprised. many people were almost reluctant to make a sale. it was wierd. parts are hard to get too apparently like a spare battery and very few places have the 18-135 lens instock either. anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera. i hope it takes many great pictures for you.

" first of all i do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer !!! so i will not go into anything technical. i will leave that to people who know more than i do. but what i am is an international traveler. i simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with snapshots. i wanted someting much better and boy did i get it with this camera. i looked at the d70s and since i have very small hands i could never feel comfortable holding it. this camera is smaller without being small. i have only taken photos locally but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start. the built in editing features (filters etc.) are wonderful to work with. i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than point and shoot snap shots ",positive
" i am by no means a pro at taking pictures but this camera makes me look close to it. so far i have just used it as a point and shoot and the pictures have been of really good quality. i am tring to learn more of the functions and one i have run across so far that i enjoy is you can choose in certain functions for your photo to be black and white color or sepia. i am not high tech but i can use this camera pretty easily. my first digital camera was a canon digital elf with only 3.2 mega pixels and there is a huge difference in the quality of the pictures when you compare. so if you can affored to spend more for more mega pixels do it. the only down sides i have seen so far is it doesn't come w/ a great memory card which most do not and i imagine if i did not have small hands that the camera would be a little awkward to handle. it has lots of buttons and dials so you have to hold just right so that you don't hit any. but overal i am very satisfied w/ my purchase and hope to become a better photographer with the help of this camera. canon cameras have served my family and i very well over the years ",positive

" i am certainly happy i bought this filter kit. for a starting photographer the price was right and i have not noticed any quality issues. the uv filter stays on a lens at all times as it's cheaper to replace the filter than it is to have a scratched lens element repaired. the light polarizer is very handy and also works very well cutting down greatly on glare. i have not yet had the occasion to use the warming filter yet. the filter case is a nice extra it fits right in my camera bag and is out of the way untill i need it ",positive
" this is one of the best bargains that i've seen essentially you get 3 filters for the price of one. the image quality with these filters is great the 812 (warming) filter is by far a favorite giving back the color richness that flash photography so often washes out that is unless you have the patience for constantly tweaking your flash power. aside from the 812 the uv protector is basically a clear protective filter. while it obviously has advantages over clear glass i tend not to think of it as any different. this too is a great filter which i use about half the time because it doesn't affect color hues or change f stop values too greatly while it takes the worry out of carrying the camera around ready for any candid shots that may occur. finally included is the circular polarizer. this filter adjusts the amount of uv light entering the camera by spinning the filter to the direction the uv rays are entering (or turning the thingy till things look better). this lens is great for sunny days and will take surface glare off lakes and glass making them transparent again. it also makes colors more crisp in general when photographing buildings and other large reflective man-made things. so things sound great so far but now to why i only give this item 4 stars. while tiffen is known to be one of the best at photo and video filters they have quality control issues that do no live up to thier reputation. in my case the 812 filter arrived with a discoloration in the glass. while it was didn't hurt image quality with the flaw being towards the edge of the filter i none the less didn't want to find a situation in which the flaw would diminish quality. seeing as it was not amazon's fault my first e-mail went to tiffen for a replacement which they said they would gladly do but only after i send them the filter and they recieve it would they ship my replacement (not an option in my circumstances). instead amazon's wonderful customer service shown through again and within 3 days they had replaced the entire set. the second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters were in perfect condition i traded just the 812. i havn't had any other issues and i'm very satisfied with my filters. the only other word of warning would be to that of the circular polorizer. while i recieved 2 that were flawless occassionally i have read in reviews customers have received ones that were assembled backwards making the lens useless. a quick way to check to see if your cp is working correctly is to hold it thread facing yourself and look at an lcd monitor or tv and spin it until the picture dissapears(obviously working correctly). i still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what i do now chances are everything will show up perfectly but none the less if you're concerned order it before you need it and check everything over carefully. amazon is always the best for returns and will often ship a replacement the next day with overnight shipping ",positive

" i searched and researched the lens to purchase with my canon rebel xti for weeks because i knew that i did not want the kit lens. i also did not have the money to spend on a 5 6 or $700 dollar lens. in the end after reading countless reviews ones implementing professional techniques and ones using just opinion this lens looked to be the best value. for the money i really don't think that you can beat this lens. it focuses quickly it is really quiet while doing it and it is sharp enough for the money. plus it has full time manual focus which is a really big plus for a lens in this price range. the only problem is it is a little on the narrow side with the 1.6 crop factor on the rebel xti but i would much rather have to deal with that than a sub-par image. in summary i would recommend this lens in place of the kit lens to anyone who doesn't have the money to buy an l series lens. it is really a great value ",positive

" i just bought a digital rebel about a month ago. love the camera my old 380ex speedlight integrates with the camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the rebel. this flash does the job for the rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab that item. another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital rebel lacks. when this flash is mounted on your digital rebel you don't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash. the rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550ex to focus the lens; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs. the flash has tons of features that most of us might never use but as a advanced amateur i'm glad they're there so i can play with that if i should choose to try out some fancy stuff. the wireless slave capability is handy but you've got to have at least one more 420ex 550ex or 580ex to use that. i like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head it's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up/down---this should make the head sturdier than i've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts. this unit is a honker--really big and no lightweight either. get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you. what's the difference between this and the 580ex? the 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes for me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. all of the newer eos camera bodies are fully supported by this unit it also works on older eos bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that aren't there on older stuff. i like this flash it covers well cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use. when you get yours don't lose that book canon doesn't seem to have them online anywhere i can find and i've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one ",positive
" this is one fantastic flash. i had it on my canon a2e for four years and was ambivilent but if you match this lens with one of canon's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550ex's features you have an awesome powerful flexable flash that can change the way you shoot ",positive

" this isn't a full review but some thoughts i've had after using it for a long time. stabilization- the fact is that if this is the camera you take everywhere with you you are going to either lose shots or have to use the flash. if flash doesn't bother you no sweat. but i've never like the look of it. ease-of-use- great. voice memo- i use this feature all the time. it would be nice if it had a pause button because without it i end up with many small files. ex- this is where you set the exposure. casio does a great job putting everything in one place. the only thing they should have done better is that if you have changed a selection (e.g. iso 200 to 400) and hit the shutter release it should take the shot. instead nothing happens. you have to click set first. it's an extra step that you have to make during a critical time ",positive
" after checking prices with all the usual pricing bots i found a better price including free shipping by going directly to amazon. this lowest price did not appear in the other searches so it pays to go to amazon first. i replaced my canon sd400 with the casio and find the controls more logical to use. this is important if you don't use the camera for a while because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. also the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. you do not have to remove the battery in the casio to charge it as you do with the canon sd400. the vga movie quality is superior on the casio. still pictures appear to be about equal. amazon delivered by ups in record time even with a weekend inbetween. i ordered on a friday and received it the following tuesday. go with amazon!

" this was one of the first lenses that i purchased with my rebel xt. now after taking several thousand pictures with it i can honestly say it was well worth the cost. i very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod. i also have the 180mm f/3.5l macro lens which costs about 3 times more than this lens and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4x and 2x tc's it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod. the 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your iso up a little to do so. i have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results. all-in-all given it's small size and light weight i very rarely leave this lens behind when i go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot ",positive
" for its time and price (at the time) a fantastic camera. 6.3 mp is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro (non-studio) work and this camera works very well with what really matters: canon's fantastic lenses. battery life on this camera is very good. the shutter lag (between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo) is fairly well non-existent and the only real lag i have is when i am shooting multiple photos in raw format. as most photographers know the lens is almost more important than the body and outside of leica lenses i don't think anything really competes with canon's line. the 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...i used it at the beach and on hikes with my dog when i don't want to lug around my bigger more expensive higher-quality lenses. but for $75 or so you can have a 50mm 1.8 eos lens which will supplement the 18-55 nicely particularly for night photography. my one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings. when i shoot raw this isn't such a big problem because i can fix it in photoshop but most everything i shoot inside unless i manually mess with the white balance every time has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots and then is annoying after. i think the more advanced eos models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem and also help a bit with the lag between the raw shots...but for the money this camera is excellent and far far superior to for example olympus' digital exquivalent (for a similar price). the difference as far as i'm concerned is in the absolute advantage canon has in lens quality. you can use a high-end consumer body like this one use a professional piece of canon glass (lens) and take excellent photos. i wouldn't invest in a system that doesn't also boast excellent lens quality ",positive
" there are already tons of reviews on the eos 300d (digital rebel) but i do want to share my experience with the camera so i will keep this short. i bought this camera about 5 months ago and i am in love with. i was not new to photography or to slr's but new to the world of digital slr. i had previously used an ancient minolta x-570 a pro-sumer 35mm film slr with a vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens. first and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures very high quality and no distortion that i have seen. this camera is particularly good as a beginner's dslr because there are so many options to use and learn. but until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues you can use this just like a point and shoot. battery life has been excellent so far: thought i would suggest getting an extra to have as a backup for long days of taking photos. i have also been quite happy with the kit lens which i wasn't sure i would like since it is not as versatile as the lens i had been using on my minolta. but the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool: i have been able to take some great shots while also learning what kinds of other better lenses i would like to add to my setup. **the only issue i have had was a problem with a sandisk 2gb cf card. after about 300 shots the camera froze and stopped responding to that card. i was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact but don't risk it. if you're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera spend a little extra money on the sandisk ultra ii line of high-speed cards.

" this camera is amazing. out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 i've used this is by far the best beating out the kodak and the sipix. i originally bought the sipix and it was junk. don't buy the sipix that's under $150. the kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the finepix but the software was a little better being from kodak. this camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels but i don't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing. it comes with a 16mb removable memory card so you can take around 49 pics at 1mp around 24 at 2mp and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution or more on a lower setting. the lcd screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power and the 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long. it has a nice sleak design and the software has no issues with windows xp at least. the only cons i could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2x digital zoom which is pretty much useless and i never use it since it's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer. so you can consider it not having any zoom. the software for it works well but it could be better options wise. the filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day (since it creates folders based on date) you'll have to rename each pic. but i hardly complain since the pictures come out so incredibly well. i'm so happy with this camera! if you want a camera under $150 this is the one to get. don't even waste your time with the kodak unless you want the one with 3x optical zoom but that's $200. i use it for general purpose taking pictures of freinds and such. once in a while i take a picture of a sunset at 2mp and that will be photo quality printed on a full page. 1mp creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images and .3mp will created good smaller images to put on websites. there's no reason to buy anything else go with the fuji finepix a200!

" i got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer and it's great. as much as i'd love to have a canon powershot it's a bit out of my price range. all the people who think that using the lcd screen runs out the batteries after &quot;2-4 pictures&quot; are lying to you. i bought rechargable batteries from radioshack and i've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed. this is a good camera with good quality in good lighting. in dark or overcast situations it can look a bit grainy but that's easily photoshopped. i recommend that when uploading plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter because uploading sucks all battery power right out. i recommend this for someone who hasn't owned a digital camera before or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price ",positive

" i highly recommend the raynox dcr 1540pro teleconverter for the canon s2 instead of the canon branded one. hoya makes a 67mm uv filter for this and both are available at lensmate.com. the canon wc-dc58a wide angle converter however is really good. tiffen made a better one but it seems to not be available anymore. by the way the function that the s2 provides for settings using the lens adaptors and teleconvertors are to adjust for the autofocus function of the camera and are necessary unless you wish to try to focus yourself using the manual focus which in my mind because of the lcd both in the screen as well as in the viewfinder with a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder is iffy at best. trust the camera.....it really does an excellent job. one final note i would recommend using the focus bracketing option in lower light situations as the auto focus is weak in those situations. ",positive
" this lens does exactly what it should. the overall quality is extremely good. take a look at my photos: - first photo is without the lens - second photo is with the lens and flash - third photo is with the lens and without flash there are a few things to note about the photos: - there is a substantial amount of barrel distortion. this is normal. try not to have straight lines near the borders of the photo to make it less obvious. - fringing is exaggerated. you notice fringing (purple or blue tints) along high contrast edges of objects that are near the borders. you can see this on regular shots but is more exaggerated with the wide angle lens. - the lens makes a shadow when using the built-in flash. you can see the shadow in the photo with the flash. in a darker environment it is very obvious. the external flash is the only way to fix this. a couple details: - you can get an extender that is a nice brushed aluminum here: http://www.lensmateonline.com/s2.html - the camera has a setting (converter) to indicate that you have the lens attached. it's not obvious what it does but it is indicated by a change in the image stabilization icon so i assume that it affects the way that image stabilization works. overall i recommend this lens ",positive
" i'm still learning to use this camera and all the features. so far it is amazing. i've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots. i use the auto mode a lot and it works great. the zoom is amazing. i love that it tells me when i am focused. also it has great battery life. i'm very happy with this camera ",positive

" canon has three digital cameras for $2500+. the 1ds mark ii the 1d mark iin and the relatively new 5d. i chose canon over nikon (which i've shot most of my photographic life) because of canon's more impressive suite of lenses. here's the decision process i went through. as with most products it comes down to how you'll use it. all of them have tradeoffs. 1. megapixels. more pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged (and cropped more tightly)with less deterioration. the 1ds is the market leader at 16.7mp the 5d comes in at 12.7mp and the 1d at 8.2mp. if you're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1ds probably makes sense. if you're a wedding photographer the 5d is probably the sweet spot. in practice however the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people. at 8.2mp you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond the camera's native resolution. up to that size you certainly won't see much difference in prints from the three cameras. that said the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude. 2. full frame. the 1ds and 5d are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera. the 1d and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor (fovcf). for the 1d it's 1.3x. what that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor don't capture everying the lens is seeing - it crops the view in a little tighter. the result: your lenses are effectively 1.3x longer. a 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on. because the camera is effectively cropping the edges of the image that the lens produces it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses. whatever camera you use what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get and it doesn't affect the pixel resolution of the image. my 300 mm lens with a 1.4x extender and a 1.3x fovcf is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory. (if you're switching from film to digital some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the focvf. your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm.) 3. durability. this was most important to me though it may not be for someone who doesn't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years. both the 1ds and 1d sport complete metal bodies sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200000 cycles. the 5d - a very solid camera - is designed for 100000 is not weather sealed and has more plastic components. 4. weight/size. what a solid metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight. for those who prefer a camera with heft these have it. for many people this is a big drawback. the 1ds and 1d are 43 oz. or almost three pounds for just the body without the big battery. add the battery and you're at 54 oz. the 5d is just 29 oz. and 31 oz. with battery. the 1ds and 1d with built-in vertical grips are also more than 2 inches taller. if you're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around the 5d is it. 5. speed. there's a reason the 1d is the camera of choice for photojournalists sports and many bird photographers. it shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second compared to 4 fps for the 1ds and 3 fps for the 5d. for most day-to-day uses 3 fps is more than adequate. from using both i'd say the 1d autofocuses a bit faster too. the 1d has 45 autofocus points compared to nine for the 5d. 6. price. give or take a hundred here or there the 1ds is about $7200; the 1d about $3900; and the 5d about $3000. price will determine whether you get the 1ds or not. if you can afford it go for it. otherwise other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision. what did i decide? first i looked at how i'd use the camera: photojournalism travel and wildlife photography. the higher fps was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed so either the 1d or 1ds would do. in the end i decided i'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera. (i bought the 300 f/2.8 is for close to the difference in price.) so i went with the 1d mark iin. if my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need a new car i'd probably have gone with the 1ds. i'm very happing with the decision and the camera. for most people and most uses - general portrait landscape and travel photography - the 5d is probably the way to go. (or perhaps the next greatest camera that canon will announce later this year. ",positive

" i bought the 250d lens to use with my sony dsc-f717 and it is just wonderful. i can also use it with my canon g3 because i bought a canon ladc58b conversion lens adapter (which is required and is inexpensive). i had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and i have seen many wonderful examples of its use. i recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their macro photography shine. get one! just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and don't be confused as to which one will fit your camera. edit: just a clarification: this one 'is' the 58mm even though above (on this page) when you click the links see more technical details and see all product description it mentions 52mm. this is misleading and confusing. at the very very top of this page it says 58mm. let me just assure you that this particular one 'is' the 58mm and 'is not' the 52mm. late edit (aug 04 06): well it looks as if amazon finally corrected that misleading info i mentioned just above in my clarification ",positive
" this is just a plain sweetheart of a lens. it covers the useful 18-35 mm range (which is 27-52mm on a nikon digital slr which is a very useful range). this lens costs less than half the price of the (expensive) professional nikon 17-35 and does almost as nice a job. sufficiently nice in fact that most amateurs will not discern much if any difference. while not built like a tank i think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros. on a nikon digital slr which will use the center portion of this lens (due to the size of the sensor in the slr) you can expect excellent even spectacular results. this is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots portraits or just plain walking around taking pictures. someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent versatile lens. this one is great for parties vacations and the works. the images i have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast are very sharp and have beautiful color rendition. there just is not a lot not to like about this lens. i give it 4 stars for overall performance but 5 stars for value and price/performance. some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers. this is one of those ",positive
" well besides a whole bucket full of money one of them lets you take photos in lower light okay that's obvious. the 16-35mm is a bit heavier but not so you'd notice unless maybe you were carrying it around all day without eating and you're a bit over the hill. so why pay the extra money unless of course you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening? maybe you shouldn't because i've been doing a lot of photo taking with both film and digital and as one would expect from the l lenses the photos are crisp and sharp. in fact i keep i the 17-40 on the camera i carry around all day you know the one i might leave on the table in a restaurant when i got to the restroom. it's a lot less money to lose to someone looking for a five finger discount. however my gal pal sara and i take a lot of early morning photos. she shoots old houses and she never ever goes out without the 16-35mm. she swears by it loves it sometimes i think better than me. so there is a difference i'm the kind of person that could happily live with less expensive lense sara is not. however they both deliver gorgeous photos. you can't go wrong if the lense has that red circle around it. jack priest sailor home from the se ",positive

" when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery. they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes. now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good business choice. so i said no. so i got the camera charged the battery until the light went green (which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it) and started taking pictures (oh i also got a 2g cf) worked great....so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots. keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase. well 6000' 300 pictures and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong still have 200 shots left for the trip home battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button. so all in all i think the battery life is great now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point the original will work fine. as for the quality of photos.....i love them ",positive

" i like many people research high-tech purchases before buying because of the complexity of the items and the invariably high cost of some of the items. digital cameras are no exception. i was looking for a replacement for my konicaminolta dimage z1. my requirements were fairly straight forward: the new camera had to have a 10x zoom no less than a 5mp processing chip and third get my photography skills to the point that the camera after this new one could be a dslr. i have read the reviews here on amazon regarding the performance of the s9000 and while some of them i felt were right on others did not read the professional reviews before purchasing this camera. the intended use of this camera has never been a point and shooter. while the s9000 does possess automatic functions to streamline use these features are whoafully inadequate for the overall optical and proccessing capibilities that fuji strove for in it's design. let me for clarifications' sake say this loud and clear: if you want breathtakingly beautiful clear vibrant pictures with perfect exposure using this camera then you must use the manual settings. this is not a point and shoot type of a camera!!!!!! out of the box the s9000 has been a godsend. not only are the images super sharp with no hint of edge fall off that hampers other high res cameras but the exposure is so perfect that i question my ability for luck. the setups are very easy and the controls and functions are a snap. the white balance and shutter speed settings are not easy concepts to grapple with in potography and yet fuji has made short work of them with their intuitive design. there really are two photographic miracles at work in the s9000: one is the processor that captures detail and color that you feel guilty for paying so little for something that is better than much more expensive equipment and two is that the exposure is so good that if i did not know better i would think that i was using an advanced film slr. this is an absolute rave for this product. the fit and finish are superb ergos are comfortable and controls easy to find and use and it fulfilled my need for a camera that would get me ready for a dslr but not be too complex. the only downside to this camera is that it will take time to process the image before exposure but outside of some dslrs this is a problem with all digital cameras. it is true that this camera is big and heavy but then photographic perfection ain't free. home run fuji!!

" the other day i used a friend's standard digital camera for a little while. the whole time i found myself missing the manual zoom instant response and convient manual buttons on my d50. this camera takes amazing pictures. as an dslr beginner i used the camera in auto mode for the first several weeks now after reading some books on photography i'm slowing starting to use the manual features. the d50 lets me choose the level of control that i'm comfortable with from full manual to full automatic; and both options are just a turn of the dial away. the body of this camera is built like a tank. metal and high quality plastics abound. the buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable. it is a beautiful piece of precision engineering ",positive
" not much to add to the other positive reviews posted other than i am another user that loves my d50. have had it for a year now and shot over 10000 photos with excellent results (mostly landscape and wildlife). excellent image quality and the hand grip fits perfectly to both my hand and my husbands. the only con i can think of at this time is that there is no backlight on the top panel - this makes it difficult to adjust settings in low/ no light situations. also for people that are used to the little compact point & shoot cameras this might seem a little overwhelming at first and bulky to carry around (which is why i have a little pocket camera for my purse). i also got the 18-200 lens and love it - perfect walk around lens ",positive
" i needed a lens hood for my 50mm lens and paying $25 for a hood on a $75 lens might seem ridiculous. however that might be because the $75 lens is so inexpensive. if the lens was $250 then paying an extra 10% might not seem too bad. i just saw the total cost of the lens and hood for $100 and that's good for a terrific prime lens and its hood. however please note: the lens hood is rather shallow (1 star reduction) and it is a screw-on two piece kit (1 star reduction). one piece is the adaptor that screws-on where the filters normally go (uv filter) in front of the lens and is intended to be a permanent integral part of the lens and the second piece is the hood that snaps on and off this adaptor. the adaptor ring retains the same 52mm rim size so your protective filter can go before or after the adaptor. (1 bonus star) because $100 is still a bargain for a 50mm f1.8 super fast super sharp super clear light weight beginner lens and hood kit! i hope this helps rather than confuse. :) ",positive
" this kit is a must have for any of the compatible canon cameras. digital camera rule #1: always carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for that alone. the leather case is great: stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera. the neck strap is quite strong and looks good too. it may not be everyone's cup of tea but i like it. it comes in handy when i need quick access to the camera and don't want to fumble through pockets or bags ",positive
" although this is a good batch of accessories the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times. it has no carry strap -- the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top. so if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture you must open the case pull the camera's strap through the slit then lift the camera out. it would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy ",positive
" i have been working for a major daily newspaper in baltimore for 2 decades. perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography. i have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s. maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography. this may be long- winded but it's extensive and can be useful. i received the nikon d2h camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago. i think i got them shortly after the d2h system was released in 2003. since then i have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary sports daytime available light flash and dead- of- night -- for the paper i work for. this is the only camera i work with. first please read the manual. there is a ton of information there and the information is terrific to begin with. the d2h is highly- configurable with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use (resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera). i'll just punch right in to the way it feels. the camera is a rather heavy beast and for some there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day like i do. but the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through. i've long since given up using any camera bag. all i have are a fanny pack for a 14mm 55mm teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt. and the d2h's hold the 17-35mm nikon and the 80-200mm nikon one- touch or the sigma 120-300mm 2- touch. shooting is a breeze. the batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge. i have my d2h set on iso 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower iso as often as i can because the higher isos bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation. just today i purchased digital noise plug ins for photoshop to limit this and that's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at iso 800 and above. i now have little problems with capturing images in even barely- limited lighting. i recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an airbus at 36000 feet over the pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8 and it looks tons better than night shots via the d1h which lacked the internal digital noise filter. that filter kicks in at around 1/2 second and longer exposures and can make you wait as long as your image you've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise. when you shoot this way (and in general) don't simply react by cranking up iso because you will not be happy with your results. the camera can be loud. at over 7 frames per second it can make you obvious in a quiet room. shooting sensitive situations can be testy so limit your shooting to single frames. i wish this camera had an option to silence this camera but since the mirror has to raise and lower there's no chance to do this. am i happy with the d2h? definitely yes. are there improvements that can be made? yes. but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. people have been bailing out of using the nikon system and going canon which has some incredible gear i won't deny that. but instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment learn how to use the d2h well and you'll be much happier than ever. and that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations. for instance white balance. this can be the best thing for you or the worst thing you've ever dealt with depending upon how you approach it. daylight grey skies dusk and dawn are easy because you can set the camera to daylight flash shadow (for dusk and dawn times) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark. but the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue/green or orange- red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you don't properly use white balance. preset white balance is king here. i can get grey black and white when i preset in mercury vapor light. and i used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting can't figure. there is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well! if you do this (and i can go on for miles here) you're on your way. so with trying this d2h or considering it read through some of the digital d2h forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances. generally those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it. i can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail. when you have decent light you'll have a decent image. but when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable. in closing i have not been paid by anyone i have no nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that i'm giving the d2h credit where it's long overdue ",positive
" now that i have had this on my camera for a while now my camera feels so weird with it off i love the grip it gives and the extra battery life is great for those all day shooting events that i go to. i wish the buttons were the same plastic/chrome color as the ones on the camera but its a well built product and works fine so i cant complain ",positive
" canon's bg-e3 battery grip is one awesome extra you cannot be without. i found the extra weight and size not to be even a minor burden. i rec'd product 2 days after initial receiving date/17th st photo did a fantastic job (once again) ",positive
" my 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him. and i also don't like the washout look when i uses flash. so i researched about which slr will best meet my needs mainly catching fast action candid moments and low light photos without flash. the canon 30d comes up top on the list. it has the best high iso performance in its class (better than nikon and sony). and when i combine the 30d with the fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/2.8 is the result is amazing. i can stop any action in daylight capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod. portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background (bokeh). even the dimly-lit decors of the disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there for the halloween party at night without flash or tripod. this is really an important factor for me to buy this camera as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old. but you will need a good lens to make this work well. if you use a cheap kit lens then it will probably not matter which camera you pick. remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens (not the kit lens)and crop the pictures to magnify the details. the sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and don't need low light performance (use flash and save money). the nikon has more custom function than canon and it is really as good as canon. they both have their strength and weakness. canon just happens to have slightly better high iso performance and that suits my need better than nikon. to be fair i should mention that the nikon d200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year beating the canon 30d overall. but the d200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me better suits someone more serious about photography. the d80 is like a mini d200 but slower. so it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend. shooting in low light without flash will need good high iso performance a good fast lens (with wide aperture usually expensive) and image stabilization. if that's what you want the canon 30d with the ef-s 17-55 mm f/2.8 is will not disappoint you ",positive
" this can be a very easy to use camera. simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good jpeg images. it also can be about as complicated as you want to make it. it has many advanced features on it. i have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years. my most recent before this one being an elan ii e about 7 years ago. it's still working also. the 30d is my first digital and i absolutely love the camera. i generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 iso when shooting landscape. but the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod. i like to shoot raw so that i can tweek things a bit but the jpeg images are very acceptable. it also works extremely well for portraits. it actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher isos. 1600 looks about like 800 film to me. this is a very good value for the money in my opinion ",positive
" i upgraded from the canon digital rebel (grey body) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level. one thing i like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall ",positive
" be careful when you use this lens because it does not have is (image stabilizer) so if you have shaky hands and the exposure is any more than 1/8 of a second you are going to going to get some blur. this is why the lens is so cheap. this is especially bad when you are at the far end spectrum of this lens. if you are really zoomed in and it's cloudy then you should know to use a tripod just in case. this goes for any lens but if you will be using the 300-mm end of this then use a tripod. it's common sense but i've loaned out this lens and they complained to me afterwards ",positive
" this is the same charger came with my digital rebel however i like to charge two batteries at a time. so i bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip. the prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact flat and easy to take along with you. it's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with. ",positive
" i have been using this lens for about 2.5 years and it is an exceptional piece of equipment especially for the price! i very rarely feel the need to get a closer image than i can achieve with this lens. it's very solidly built and i am sure it will continue to be a primary piece in my kit for years to come ",positive
" i am thrilled with this lens's capabilities and the pictures it does. i test shot a corner of a window to determine if it would be good for my insect shots that i like so well. well it did great as it came but i found that i wanted to have the 1/1 capability so i bought the add-on converter and am thrilled to have added both of these necessary items for my set-up. i like nature photography the best and like to use my off summer days for hiking and finding photographs to take in perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles and subjects is what i like to specialize in. this lens will greatly enhance your experience in that 'little world' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away. i built a diffuser using a ping-pong ball over the flash so the lighting would work better. (works great btw). as usual it's great canon glass that does the trick ",positive
" i purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches. i use an original canon digital rebel and the shots are really very detailed. it is easy to use in fact i can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches. its f2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge. if you own a canon digital slr and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you.

" this is a good teleconverter that added 1.5x to the camera's native zoom. it adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots. of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement. overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots ",positive
" if you have the big lenses (400mm f/2.8l is usm or even the 70-200mm f/2.8l is usm) this is totally worth the addition. the 2x does not kill the autofocus on the f/2.8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges. check compatability on canon's website. you won't be disappointed ",positive
" purchased a printer dock and camera bundle from a local office supply store for $100. it only came with a 10 picture sample cartridge so i purchsed this from amazon. amazon had the best price around on this item and free shipping. it works great. no complaints. the paper is not quite as shiny and or as thick as the epson photo glossy paper that i still use for some pictures but works well for my classroom to give to my students. the pictures do not run like some inkjet pictures do if you accidentally drip water on them ",positive
" i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. i have had all types of cameras over the years mostly 35mm film canon slr's. i too bought all sorts of these 5-7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love slr's. i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i can't keep my hands off of it. it lacks nothing. although the kit lense is good i bought a 28-135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a wonderful new feature like low light or non-shake. this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be it won't hold you back. the battery life is great the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that's even better. i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. i always missed my 35mm canon slr's and now feel that i have an old friend back again only much much better. believe me you can't go wrong getting this camera its beyond description... ",positive
" i love the new digital canon. the only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin. i had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working. the canon people have been great and very helpful but i'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory. the photos however are wonderful. film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable. (it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos. ",positive
" now this isn't the fastest card on the market. but it is a solid reliable card. the camera itself is the bottle kneck and typically not this card. however if you are using a canon dslr of a recent flavor i would check if it needs to be rma'd. a known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images. scary. however i've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or rebel xt. i've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my pd70x and definately not with my rebel xt ",positive
" this is a great camera. plenty of resolution. excellent shot speed. sturdy frame. the kit lense doesn't do the camera justice. buy the body separate and add a better lense. on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix. it was two months before the camera was returned. sorry canon... you lose a star for that ",positive
" wow! is all i can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17-40. i've been using nikon manual-focus nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness. however after using the canon l series i've sold a lot of my nikkors. the color clarity sharpness and detail of the l lenses are amazing. the prints have this 3-d effect (without having to use those silly red/blue glasses!) 8-) within 3 weeks of receiving my 17-40 i ordered the 70-200. those two lenses will replace my whole nikkor collection. build is really good. the l zooms are a little bulkier but very managable. the nikkors are smaller but very heavy. but lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years i can see the difference. i tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun. the 17-40 surprising handles flare very well. with the sun just outside the field of view there was very little flare and loss of contrast. i also make 12x18 prints and this lens handles them easily. the body is going to be the limiting factor (refering to digital bodies). warning: once you use l glass you are going to be spoiled. you may not settle for consumer lenses anymore although some non-l lenses are quick good from what i read ",positive
" don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (ie the 20d 30d rebels etc) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already. great lens great color so well built super sharp just watch out if this is your first l lens you'll be hooked. this is a lens you will have for many years great investment ",positive
" hi have a rebel extreme and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up. i was taking pictures of dancers so needed a flash system that could keep up. the speedlite really does this perfectly - i'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos and this flash system is there each time. i don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo but if you want a flash that can keep up this one is great! i like it so much i'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot to run in slave mode with this one. ",positive
" i'm new to the digital slr world. i had been using the built in flash on my rebel xt. the built-in flash had done alright but was nothing to write home about. since i had spent most of my money on the camera i needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done. this flash met both requirements. if you are an advance user you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features. yet if you a newbie like me this flash is great! it has improved my picture quality dramaticly. ",positive
" i bought this flash to use on my canon rebel xt. the first thing i noticed was that without even reading the instructions i was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors. being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash. even when i set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down. it did not need anytime to recharge at all. i recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots. most of the pictures came back with great results. the only dissappointment i have is that when taking shots from further distance than i normally would the pictures came back darker than i would've liked. so to compensate for this i adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it right. another problem i have with the flash is the battery cover. it's flimsy and i find it awkward to open and close at times. i always feel like i'm gonna snap it off by accident. overall i am happy. it's a good flash for the price you pay. the battery life is good. i still haven't even had to recharge the batteries and i've almost taken 200 shots with it. my low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash. anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash. the difference is night and day ",positive
" the camera handles very well - it's light and drives my zoom lens and 18-55mm lens beautifully. i get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight which it does not have. the view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful showing photos as they are taken - with zoom on the back screen which immediately gives me the idea of the photo i want to use in my books. i say this is an outstanding lens and camera. ",positive
" this lens is outstanding. speed and sharpness are top-notch. i use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results. best lens in it's class at a reasonable price. it's well built sturdy and not so heavy so it's relatively easy to carry around. canon really impressed me with this lens. i use it with my eos system (traditional and digital cameras).

" had the 70-200 f/4 and loved it to pieces with a d60 and now with a 1d mkii but sold the 4.0 in order to pay for a 35-350 which is my work horse. due to the push and pull feature however the 35-350 gets dusty quick in good ol' montana land so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while and the f/stop isn't always desirable for certain situations. the 70-200 f/2.8 is amazing. the twist zoom is a little close to the camera so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it and imho is a bit too much of a turn to be from 70 to 200 in the time one might need for extreme sports. (rodeo nascar etc) the clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away. i did a comparison of images from my 70-200 f/4 when it was new and the 2.8 is still visibly sharper. i put an expensive filter on it as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions and i do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter even though it is a good b&w..... so when i can i shoot the lens with no filter if i require extreme detail. the 35-350l is nowhere near the quality of this little 2.8... if it weren't for the difference in distance this lens would be my one and only. oh and i love the is. as it is my first is lens i treasure is but know i will not buy another distance lens without it ",positive
" i use this gem on my 20d along with my 24-105mm and as far as i'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there. my 24-105 isn't the ideal indoor/low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens( although it is sharp just not quite long enough) the 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with is to boot! the photos i've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers. if you can afford it do it you won't regret i ",positive
" i spent alot of time evaluating this product. finally after reading the reviews i dug deep and spent the extra dollars to get this lense. it has been a wounderful addition to my canon reble. it is a very high quality product that is easy to use and delivers beautiful shot every time. ",positive
" from a pure image quality standpoint this lens will not please the pixel peepers. on the wide end of the zoom which i personally use more often than the telephoto end this lens is not very sharp and it suffers from fairly bad distortion. worse than that for me are the chromatic abberations; this lens is quite prone to significant ca when shot at the wide end which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness. given the price of this lens one should expect a higher level of optical performance. the maximum aperture of this lens is not very large being f/4 on the wide end and f/5.6 on the telephoto end. the image stabilization makes up for this some as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise but let's be honest here; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod. the small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark (using a tripod). yet i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars and this is not without reason. first of all the focal length range is quite handy. it isn't a mega-zoom that does everything however it covers the most often used focal length ranges and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations. the little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion and it's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end but zoomed in it's quite good. i have printed as large as 20x30 using this lens on a digital rebel and have no qualms with the results. yes there are sharper lenses out there but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print. this lens has ring usm which enables it to focus very quietly and very quickly whereas the slightly cheaper (and f2.8) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison. if you want to use this lens indoors you are best off getting a flash to go with it such as a 430ex. the lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting or during the day but won't give you good results in low light with no flash. if you will be shooting in lower light situations (people in particular) tamron and sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with f2.8 apertures and i would recommend those lenses over this one. if you'd prefer the extra telephoto range the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field (instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f/4 for instance without image stabilization you could use f/11 on this lens and get a sharp picture with better depth of field. this is even more useful in the close focus range - while this isn't a true macro lens if you take closeup photos without a tripod you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field and the is helps with that quite a bit. overall i've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens. if you like to worry about splitting hairs and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer this lens is likely to dissapoint you. if however you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded useful lens then i'd recommend it however would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options as they are also great lenses and do offer a somewhat better value ",positive
" i purchased this tripod from 47th street photo through amazon.com. the tripod appeared to arrive in good shape except that the operating instructions were not included. i immediately emailed 47th stree photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment. i asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions. they did not respond to my email so a few days later i emailed them again. once again no response. i then emailed amazon.com and informed them of the missing instructions and the non-responses from 47th street photo. no response from amazon either! as far as the tripod goes it appears to be a very good value for the money. i gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because due to the missing operating instructions i cannot be certain i have properly checked out all of its features. however i am certain that both 47th street photo and amazon.com rate zero stars for customer service. i will use neither one again ",positive
" i needed this tripod to use with my 20x50 binoculars since the least movement with 20x magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field. this tripod works well for that use. it is sturdy has lots of features and is reasonably priced. however if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars a right angle adapter will be needed. i found one on ebay for a few dollars.

" the digital rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. my previous camera was a canon a90 and i loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. i decided recently that maybe i should graduate to a slr because i was starting to get more creative with my photography. i spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the digital rebel. after a few months of owning it i still am amazed. the image quality is fantastic it's quick and responsive and every day using it i learn a little more. it's the perfect intro slr camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. i've gotten amazing shots that i could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. if you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot go for this camera you wont be sorry.

" i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. i have had all types of cameras over the years mostly 35mm film canon slr's. i too bought all sorts of these 5-7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love slr's. i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i can't keep my hands off of it. it lacks nothing. although the kit lense is good i bought a 28-135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a wonderful new feature like low light or non-shake. this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be it won't hold you back. the battery life is great the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that's even better. i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. i always missed my 35mm canon slr's and now feel that i have an old friend back again only much much better. believe me you can't go wrong getting this camera its beyond description...

" if you're looking for a high-quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors you may have found what you're looking for. the 70-200/2.8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135/2 prime lens (although not quite as sharp). the main downside to this lens is that it's big and heavy. i don't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight. and it's not exactly the sort of lens that i would want to toss into my backpack just due to the immense size. if you don't mind spending an extra $500 consider also the 70-200/2.8 is (image stabilization) version of this lens. it weighs even more but the built in is unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens ",positive
" i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well. then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories. it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have. i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not. i often carry 5-6 lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton. but when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt lowepro system it is actually very manageable. the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. but if you can overlook that this is the way to go. i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment which is nice. i really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you won't regret it.

" in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts the d70s has fallen behind the pack. (however if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.) nevertheless it's quite a good camera. what i like about it most: - it looks and feels solid. some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars. it's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it's category. - very good battery life. - backwards compatibility with decade's worth of nikon slr lenses. my gripes: - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week. - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses. - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800. - nikon's raw software and control software aren't included with the camera and are imho overpriced. (...and on top of that nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...) what would improve this camera the most: - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets and then pull them up on the fly. - replacing the idiot modes (i.e. portrait landscape etc.) with modes that you could customize ",positive
" this is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital slr camera and it was a good investment. i don't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera. it also looks nice on my canon 30d camera coupled with an l series zoom lens ",positive
" i started with the battery grip initially wanting the double battery availability. having used a 35mm with a hand strap and already realizing the value of the stability of such a strap this was my second attraction for the purchase of the battery grip and last but not at all least is the ability to use shoot from the grip itself allowing full ease of rotation of the camera. though i have never used the battery magazine that allows for the use of aa batteries having it offers a backup should the canon batteries need charging and i am in the heat of shooting. i always travel with my charge and four aa batteries. i would recommend this grip as a standard accessory for the eos-20d and eos 30-d. one thought to consider once on the camera it increases the overall height creating challanges with some camera cases.

" this is a great lens. i do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens. it is not so heavy so i use tripod without using tripod collar (costs 119.99 in b & h). this is the best value i have ever got for a lens. now i can't wait to get 17-40mm f4l too. you can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6 of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject. people complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective. i like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag. i think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful ",positive
" i owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version. overall i was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight. sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur. if you are shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend the f/4.

" this was the best item i ever bought for my camera. i do a lot of walking with my camera and thought i would use it as a walking stick which i do but the best part of this monopod is what i never thought would happen. my pictures are never fuzzy! i can take low light photos and have they come out clear. i paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. the three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. the carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched ",positive
" not knowing fully what i was getting into on a whim i purchased this monopod hoping that is was a half-way decent product i mean-it was so cheap. i was pleasantly surprised to find how sturdy the unit was and that what i had was a very high quality monopod. this was my second monopod and so i had another to compare it with (the other was bought on an auction website). in comparison the opteka was a far better monopod in height and robust thickness and i use it exclusively on my minidv shoots ",positive
" i have taught photography at the college level shoot 4x5 view camera work on occasion and am very demanding about image quality. i am quite satisfied with the image quality from my kodak p880 particularly after i installed the newest firmware upgrade available from kodak. i went through several 7mp to 8 mp cameras before finally getting the kodak p880. the p880 has better image quality than some high end sonys and olympus 7-8 mp cameras like the dsc-v3 or the sp350. i tested the p880 against the even higher end 10.3 mp large sensor sony r1 and the difference in image quality in a 13x19 print between the p880 and the r1 was barely perceptible after minor sharpening and noise reduction which the p880 images accept particularly well. the zoom lens has a very useful range and is generally pretty sharp throughout its range. balance manual controls and features feel high end and adequate for most semi-professional needs. the camera is a little slow processing and storing pictures in raw format and exposure bracketing modes but that really doesn't bother me because i do mostly landscape and fine art photos. raw file format is directly supported by most versions of adobe photoshop and photoshop elements as well as most other raw processing programs like bibble pro. unlike most sub-$500 cameras the p880 uses regular screw in haze and polarizing filters a real plus and it has a highly controllable hot shoe. manual focus is usable and manual exposure control works well. the direct mechanical zoom is also nice. overall the p880 is a digital camera that can either be a high end point and shoot slr-styled camera or one that can be used as fully manually as the most classic 35 mm film slr. although not small enough to slip in a pocket the size is still reasonable and light ",positive
" the new nikon en-el3e battery is a slight update for the nikon en-el3 provided with earlier dslr models such as the d70. it adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery. the battery is grey to distinguish it from the black en-el3. the en-el3e is backwards compatible with the en-el3: you can put it in your d70 or d50. the reverse is not true. the number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors including shooting style lcd usage and of course camera. (the 2.5 lcd on the d200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller d70.) it is sufficient for a day of shooting. unless you are using a d200 in some professional capacity in which case you'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery ",positive
" this is my first and very expensive entry into digit slr photography. i have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously. i was avoiding dslr's because i used to rarely use my eos film slr. the convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming. unfortunately so are it's limitations. so back i came and the only choice though expensive was the eos 5d for it's full frame sensor! the pain was reduced by the double rebates. wow! this is a revelation! beautifull images lot of control. i did notice that the af was not as fast as my old elan iie. i was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing. i am not happy with canon for this but i really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned. this camera also needs prime or l lenses because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses. this add's to the cost. this is an exceptional photographic tool that i hope to use to improve my skill as i explore all it's capabilities ",positive
" there's no question that paying $100 or more will get you a better monopod. but for $16 the sima smp-1 is a tremendous value. i have a sony dsc-w5 digital camera and have done everything i can think of to reduce camera-shake in low-light photos. this monopod has been great for adding stability and making my photos less blurry. the key is that it is small enough and light enough that i can take it almost wherever i go. and because it's so small i can bring it in to places that would frown upon a tripod. a monopod is not a total replacement for a tripod. but this monopod is now the only addition to my camera that i take on trips ",positive

" i've had this camera for three years. i bought it new when it was cutting edge and very expensive. i put a 128mb cf card in it. first i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software. i've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it it's been all over the country. the software has been installed on windows 95 98 2000 and xp and i haven't had any problems with it. the camera is solid performs well takes good pictures and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder. if battery life were that big a deal one could purchase a second battery and rotate. all that said i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera. they are razor sharp the color balance is perfect and the focus is great. when taking pictures of people however it shows every flaw in the subject's skin. scratches oil freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific. it requires extensive photoshopping to fix the flaws. other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better. i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. by the time the shot's taken something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted. i'm going to buy a real single-lens reflex (slr) to take baby pictures but i'll keep this as a travel camera ",positive
" if you're a professional photographer you can probably ignore this review. but then you probably won't be thinking about buying this lens anyway as you'll be off to purchase a nice l series. however if - like me - you just happen to have a nice canon digital rebel camera (or equivalent) and enjoy taking decent pictures this lens will probably work out very well for you. i've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks and it has performed very much as expected. for the price it's perfect for a go-everywhere lens. a few main points. okay it's not the best image quality. even on low/medium iso it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive canon lenses. it struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit but for well-lit outdoor shoots it's works very well. of course it would be nice to have a nice l series with is but if you can't afford that then this is a very good value lens. not for the real professionals but great if you don't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom - and let's face it who doesn't want a but more zoom ",positive
" i purchased this lens for my canon eos 20d digital camera and so far i really like it. it focuses fast and produces very sharp clear images. as with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake; i've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots. i really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots. the lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed which is typical for canon products. for the price range this is an excellent lens. you can only do better by spending considerable more money on an is lens ",positive
" i bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting. i quickly found out however that to shoot macro-only with this lens is a crime. it is a very versitile lens. its fast f/2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light. i pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my rebel xt eliminates most indoor oppurtunities. i frequently use this lens for family portraits the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject. as others have stated this is a heavy lens. it doesn't have image stabilization (is) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images. i use a beefy monopod for my best shots although i have a lot of handheld gems... if you are tight for cash this isn't the one lens that does it all. if you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits this is that lens. ",positive
" i wanted to get a macro lens and everyone told me this was the one to get... i'm so glad i did. with the smaller sensor on my 30d the 100mm is more like 150mm or so so it's a nice wide-open telephoto/portrait lens as well. i've uploaded a few photos i've taken w/ this lens to show what it's capable of in macro and telephoto. i thought the 17mm-85mm is usm lens that came e/ my camera was sharp - but compared to this lens the kit lens might as well be from a diy pinhole camera. my less than perfect rating is that there is no image stabilization available for the macro lenses. when i'm trying to hone in on bees pollenating a flower there is a lot of shake. i can't practically use a tripod when the insects are bouncing from bud to bud so i have to take 100 shots to get one that's not shake blur - and i miss some really cool shots. in addition to the lack of image stabilization i am frustrated w/ the sometimes unpredictable focusing that will happen as the lens is trying to decide whether it should be focusing at telephoto or macro. i wish there was a switch on the lens to make it macro only or telephoto only so it wouldn't be bouncing from one focal length to the other all the time. i've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro. the telephoto focal length is a bit long (for those of us who cannot afford a full-frame sensor camera) for most casual photography. i recently used this lens to shoot some promo shots of some massage therapists in a small eatery. i practically had to set up in the restaurant's bathroom to get the photos i wanted but opted for this lens because it's much faster (2.8) and i wanted to use natural light over flash. the lens is long and heavy for its range. with the addition of the battery pack grip this lens added on is very weighty so i may not take it w/ me in my kit bag on every shoot. once i add another short fixed focal length lens and a moderate telephoto to my kit my guess is that this lens will be pulled out for only special occasions. it's tack-sharp but it can be frustrating at times ",positive
" i read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens and i was not dissapointed one bit. i was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. the macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. the center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at f2.8 anything beyond f4 is tack sharp. be carefull with this lens though. the dof at f2.8 is extremely narrow. don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. the only thing i wish this lens had was image stabilizer. canon how about a 100mm macro with is?

" i love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it. the product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at. the s2 is is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags. this bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries chargers and extra media cards. there is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot. the correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens. given that limitation this is a great bag. the bag is very well made and holds my canon powershot s2 is very securely. i lay the camera on it's back and that means that even if i accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly. the material is great and the waist belt is very practical. the strap is well padded and after a day of use i believe it is one of the most comfortable straps i have used. buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it.

" after using both lenses i think this is much better. here are my reasons: 1- f 2.8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate. 2- bokeh is much better in this one. 3- macro is slightly better on this one. 4- 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size. 5- is is not very crucial in 24-50 range. ",positive
" i think it very well could be so i'm not going to differ with those who say it is.i bought this to use with a new 5d and itt's simply outstanding in every regard. so far i've kept it on the 5d and can't bring myself to take it off. i considered a couple of lenses including the is 24-105 f/4 which has a lot of appeal and the price is about the same. but this was the lens i chose in part because i already have a the 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 do is lens and the overlap seemed a waste while the extra stop helps. i have no regrets about it. sharp as a tack and quick. i note that this is not compact lens especially with the hood on and it can stretch out a lot when you widen the field. it is also not light. this lens and the 5d will give your neck and back a pain assuming you work with more than one camera. but the focal lengths covered are just about ideal and require none of the compromises that a longer zoom range require. for that i've got an 18-200 on a 20d. the 70-300 do while not an l specs out in that range and has the virtue of real compactness but it' not a lightweight. these two lenses cover just about everything for me. and i can keep the 10-22mm on the 20d for the extra-wide shots. since writing the initial review i've since traveled for several weeks with this lens and it fully lived up to expectations. given the difficulties of travel these days i am concerned about the problem of not being able to carry it with me -- not a problem to date except for britain. but always possible. and despite the weight i might favor the 70-200 f/2.8l is usm as a second travel lens- i like the brightness of the focus. one suggestion. there's a temptation to use this lens wide open a lot of the time. it's very good and sometimes that's the best thing. but i've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down a good deal for short night time exposures on a tripod and a remote release. the effect with lights etc. is considerably different along with the extended depth of field. ",positive
" if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye. this 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor. if you love the fish eye style and have that camera you'll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip. i was disapointed with this lens for that reason. the sigma 8mm is great. a note to the reviewer below. sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones. this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy. it happens often enough with sigma gear. with this lens its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want. bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out. decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy. i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge. sounds like you got a bad one ",positive
" 15 years of photography experience here... the sigma 15mm fisheye has been extensively reviewed and compared by other websites (go ahead and search) and this is a very good product. the canon has a tighter focus and a *touch* faster in focusing but with the massive depth of field with this lens it's not a problem at all. be aware that if you use this on a 1.6 crop factor digital slr that has aps sensors like my 20d or digital rebel then the fisheye effect is not as pronounced on film or 1.3 or full frame digital slrs. watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also...but that happens to any lens that has protruding or bulbous lenses. this is a much better bang for the buck lens than the canon equivalent which costs significantly more. if you search around you can find much lower prices on this lens ",positive

" it is a great compact camera with a good zoom. i can now leave a larger lens on my nikon dx 70 and use this for closer shots. you do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want. i really like it for most general quick shots carry it wth me most of the time ",positive
" this camera has been called a pro-sumer model and you should really take that title seriously. the quality of the pictures that it takes are just as good as a professional digital camera of the same resolution. the trade off is that it is really not happy being thrown in a bag (or big pocket if it fits). why? because canon have given it a really annoying power-on switch that is guaranteed to turn the camera on 90% of the time when you're moving it to or from a bag. to compound this problem the lens extends (in your bag) pushing off the lens cap and leaving it open for possible damage. so if you think of this as a professional camera to be kept in a real camera-case you'll probably be okay. if you're somebody like me who likes to throw his camera in a bag or pocket you're going to be annoyed by the power switch. that said i do love the quality of the pictures and all control that the camera gives you over every aspect of taking them. cons: stupid power-on switch that always catches and turns camera on; lens cap is kind of loose and falls off easily; widest angle is maybe a little too telephoto still (around 35mm?) pros: awesome pictures; tons of controls all over the outside of the camera allowing you to control a lot without having to resort to menus; professional features including flash hot-shoe and replaceable lens; great battery life; awesome picture ",positive
" i bought this filter for my 28-135 is canon lens and so far it has worked out great. unlike some of the other tiffen filters i bought this one fits just right on the lens. all sides are even and it sits flush against the lens. i haven't noticed any artifacts from pictures i've taken yet but i haven't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens. the night shots i've take so far i've been quite pleased with however ",positive
" i have another camera w/ 12x optical & tons of features but i wanted something compact & ready to take quick snaps. this fits the bill. on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots. the x-large screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera (canon a80)...either that or my hand is steadier. last but not least - the battery life was impeccable. i took a nearly 200 photos plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge. the battery is a 'custom' one which concerned me but the charger is very compact and travels well. it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use - no cables :) ",positive
" i absolutely love this camera. i've told everyone i know to buy it. the picture quality is amazing. there are so many options with this tiny little camera! you can edit pictures before you even print them. zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way and so much more. i take pictures of everything! i charged the battery when i got the camera which was about three weeks ago and it's still going. i have 7/8th of battery life left. i haven't had to charge it again. i am so happy with my purchase! i hope this helps you ",positive
" i wanted to buy a compact slim d-camera. those with larger zoom are quite bulky you can't carry around all the time. i think a slim camera is a better choice. i slip into my pocket while wondering around and come across something nice and take a picture of it. you can't do it with a huge camera. after i made up mind about a slim camera my choices were either casio exilim or sony dscw series. casio exilims are very sexy. they have a lot of mode scenes. they also function as voice recorder. you can take pictures of book pages etc. they have anti-shake capability which is said to reduce blurred images. i was almost buying a casio exilim. being a diligent person i wanted to search more and more. i found out that the so-called anti-shake feature is a bogus. many people found it useless. that was a good reason to choose casio. then i found the picture quality of exilim is not really good.i found some pictures taken with exilim. they were soft not crisp colors. search the web reviews made by photo professionals. casio exilim is rated significantly less than sony in picture quality. with iso 200 noise was still detectable in most reviews . those same reviewers however found sony dscw doing a better job . there was no noise with iso 400 which means even in lower light condition sony did a better job (less granularity in pictures with low light). big difference!. one feature of sony that made it very attractive was its strong macro. it is 0.74 inch which means you can bring your camera 0.74 inch (2 mm) close to an object (say a bug) and still take a brilliant picture of it. now comparison of exilim and sony to summarize: casio exilim anti-shake (it's a bogus) slim lower macro (2.5 inches) lower picture quality (detectable noise at iso 200) a lot of scene modes quick shutter sony dscw series slim (in fact it is slimmer) higher macro (0.74 inches) higher picture quality (no noise in iso 400) not a lot of scene modes quick shutter so.....i purchased a sony dscw 7 mp. i took lots of pictures. they are all brilliant detailed and crisp true colors. i tried macro and took pictures of bugs. you can see the hairs on the legs of bugs. absolutely no noise whatsoever no blurry. it's a marvel of technology. i took pictures of fireworks in july 4th using high iso setting. they came out brialliantly like professional pictures. it also uses a different kind of battery that you can't buy at your grocery which can leave you vulnerable. so you may wanna buy a spare one (about 40 bucks). but you can always recharge it. and it lasts much much longer than aaa or nimh batteries. it was a perfect choice. i highly recommend it.

" i just got this camera a month ago and i am satisfied with it. it has a lot of features despite its size. and for point and shoot i can say it's a great buy comparable to other power packed cameras it even takes better pictures sometimes. but i just had to give it a 4 because i thought i could do more with it. but you can't do much with the settings since it has it's own default settings for certain conditions. but over all it's a great camera. if you're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek this is definitely a good buy.

" yes it is a very fine lens. is and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this i decided to sell it in favour of my ef 24-70 2.8l after 2 weeks of usage. f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier. bokeh is also worse than the other one. the viewfinder gets darker in 1.6 crop bodies. 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size. plus the macro option is weaker on this one. if you don't care about the weight go with the ef 24-70 2.8l imho.

" i own several canon lens for my 20d and this is hands down the best. i had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews and i got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways. (of course it costs a lot more). recently went with the grandchildred to sea world and i got 100% good photos with several really outstanding ones. it is light accurate and has is - what more do you want? you can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it. bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment. if you have one lens this is the one ",positive
" i've had this lens for 2 months now and love it. it was my first l lens and i can see the quality difference in this line. first i tried the 28-135 is-pretty good. but i wasn't totally happy so returned it and ordered the 24-105 l. now i'm happy. contrast sharpness & ca are much better. build quality & feel are superior as well. plus the is really works. i will try & get all is lens in the future i believe it is worth the extra cost. focusing is very quick and zoom action is smooth & steady. if you're on a budget the 28-135 is real nice. but to go all the way i recommend this lens. the is on the 24-105 l is quieter i found. the price is a bit steep but optical quality is there resale value will remain good and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens.

" despite reading glowing reviews about this lens i was still surprised to see how well it performed. the lens is so sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes from a distance of three quarters of a football field away shooting hand held with late afternoon light which will print a 5x7 and still look like a pro took them! if you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and can't afford or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures then you should give this lens your serious consideration.

" at a recent nye event i shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness & clarity of this lens performance. its so fast and the colors are vibrant. i am not a seasoned pro but with the 20d and this lens it makes me look pretty close. i did shoot in manual and once i got my aperture & shutter speed dialed in it pumped out a lot of great pics. i have also shot some pics of waterfalls (slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image) and portraits of people and again it oozed excellence. the 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience ",positive
" for the price and quality i rated this lenses with 5 stars. if you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos i took in europe. i too around 5000 photos. i posted a few on the web (see link below). for the price i recommend this lens as walk around lens. the zoom is pretty usefull they are very realiable and (almost) very sharp. get this lens instead of the kit lens (18-55 mm) until you are ready to spend more. here are some of my pictures taken in europe with this lens (images have been compressed): http://www.laplazita.net/europa/ ",positive
" every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it. pretty infuriating especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it. yes you can always remove those on photoshop (or cheaper yet the gimp); but isn't it cool when you look at a picture and say: that is it nothing to do on it! ?? and it wasn't just the sky. any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks. with this blower greatly priced (pity that adorama doesn't have free shipping though) i put my camera on the tripod pointed it down squirted three or four times - and gone are the specs!!! great buy for dslr owners ",positive
" this camera is a steal. the reviews on amazon helped me decide on this camera and sure it is worth it. ",positive
" i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work. when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with. unless you are going for a very shadowy high-contrast image this diffuser can save the day. it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind. sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences ",positive
" this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed. the white box is for general use. also available are the green omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold omni-bounce for a warming effect. pros: inexpensive solution for better flash photography. a quality product that works. cons: non ",positive
" after checking prices with all the usual pricing bots i found a better price including free shipping by going directly to amazon. this lowest price did not appear in the other searches so it pays to go to amazon first. i replaced my canon sd400 with the casio and find the controls more logical to use. this is important if you don't use the camera for a while because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual. also the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera. you do not have to remove the battery in the casio to charge it as you do with the canon sd400. the vga movie quality is superior on the casio. still pictures appear to be about equal. amazon delivered by ups in record time even with a weekend inbetween. i ordered on a friday and received it the following tuesday. go with amazon!

" this was one of the first lenses that i purchased with my rebel xt. now after taking several thousand pictures with it i can honestly say it was well worth the cost. i very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod. i also have the 180mm f/3.5l macro lens which costs about 3 times more than this lens and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4x and 2x tc's it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod. the 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your iso up a little to do so. i have also used this lens for both inside and outside portrait work with very nice results. all-in-all given it's small size and light weight i very rarely leave this lens behind when i go out because you never know when you might see a great macro shot ",positive

" i recently moved into the prosumer level of digital. the canon d30 has proven to be an awesome camera. there maybe better (d60) but if you are serious about digital the d30 has to be one of the best cameras for the price. there is a slight lag between shots but if you are not photographing speeding bullets and express trains the time between shots is hardly a distraction ",positive

" this camera is amazing. out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 i've used this is by far the best beating out the kodak and the sipix. i originally bought the sipix and it was junk. don't buy the sipix that's under $150. the kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the finepix but the software was a little better being from kodak. this camera can take pictures of resolution up to 2 megapixels but i don't even use that option because the 1 megapixel pictures are so amazing. it comes with a 16mb removable memory card so you can take around 49 pics at 1mp around 24 at 2mp and it takes short videos for about 30 seconds in mpeg format at a 320 x 160 resolution or more on a lower setting. the lcd screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power and the 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long. it has a nice sleak design and the software has no issues with windows xp at least. the only cons i could think of are that the only zoom it has is 2x digital zoom which is pretty much useless and i never use it since it's the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer. so you can consider it not having any zoom. the software for it works well but it could be better options wise. the filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day (since it creates folders based on date) you'll have to rename each pic. but i hardly complain since the pictures come out so incredibly well. i'm so happy with this camera! if you want a camera under $150 this is the one to get. don't even waste your time with the kodak unless you want the one with 3x optical zoom but that's $200. i use it for general purpose taking pictures of freinds and such. once in a while i take a picture of a sunset at 2mp and that will be photo quality printed on a full page. 1mp creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images and .3mp will created good smaller images to put on websites. there's no reason to buy anything else go with the fuji finepix a200!

" first thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying. the kit lens comes with canon 20d 30d 300d or xt is the lower version non usm one. on the higher version usm ones you will see the red color usm at the front of the lens. according to the reviews compare with the non usm ones optically they are the same. however the usm motor does focus faster and much quieter. people complain about the build quality. actually i feel that it is really not that bad much better than the canon 50mm f1.8 ii. the usm auto focus performance is fast never hunt and much quieter than the 50mm f1.8 ii. it fits nicely on the xt. do not compare this hundred dollar lens to other lenses cost three times or more. we have to compare apple to apple. if you know the limitations on this lens and use it wisely the images will come out nicely. 1. this is not the lens for indoors low light conditions. if you need to take lots of indoor pictures and the flash is not allowed go get a different lens. (for example i use a canon 50mm f1.4 for this kind of situation.) 2. the distortion on 18mm is quite a bit. avoid taking strait lines (like buildings) pictures on the edge while wide open. however this can be easily corrected on computers. 3. step down the aperture to f8 or f11 the resolution will be improved a lot even at the corners. overall the performance is very good for a hundred dollar lens. it is very light weight and highly portable while traveling. this fits my needs as a cheap but fast with good image quality walk around lens.

" let's be honest... a kit lens that adds approximately $70 to the overall price of a camera body is not supposed to be canon l-series quality. sure you can find a better quality lens but not for $70 you can't! i plan to use this lens as a knock around lens that allows me to get more familiar with my camera and run off some shots. personally (and this is a personal preference) i find that i tend to want to be closer to subjects anyway - with the 1.6x factor on the rebel xt i'm in great shape with some of my other lenses. if you don't happen to already have a super wide lens in your arsenal and you are getting a digital eos with the 1.6x magnification factor then buy this lens. please don't let some of the other lens snobs sway you - a few of which are actually posers that snap less than 500 pix per year and spend more time looking at the technical aspects of the picture instead of its true artistic value. i can hear them now.. it isn't contrasty enough the barrel distortion is horrible at the wide end pin cushion is significant... i say bah!! are these statements true... sure they are... to a degree. but let's remember that not everyone can afford to be as picky. buy the lens load the camera with a fresh battery and a blank memory card and get out there!! if you find yourself shooting at the wide end often then sell/give this lens to a colleague and go in search of another (higher quality) lens... very little lost. enjoy yourselves and take lots of pictures... good luck ",positive

" i've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it's been a tried and true companion. i've easily taken over 10000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs. the features that really set this camera apart are the 12x zoom the image stabilization (a must with such a large zoom) and the rotating screen (great if you want to take a picture of yourself :)). i also love the macro mode i've gotten some great quality close-ups. for most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well. performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife sports landscape beach etc. my only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations. pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond sometimes not responding at all. also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular aa batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting (around 200 pictures) or less if i was shooting in cold weather. i would definately recommend rechargable batteries. overall i've really enjoyed this camera. i've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations (which i was rarely in anyway) it never let me down. both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it ",positive
" i had viewed concert photos taken with the s2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away. saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they didn't even come close. i was using the canon a80 prior and while i was happy with it my first round of photos with the s2 proved to be most impressive. while you can use this as a point and shoot this is a camera that you should spend some time learning so that you can get the most from it. and although the s3 is the latest version of the camera i'm not sure you get that much more for the money ",positive
" i'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power. it's compact not heavy has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right. in addition to the light output the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced an excellent feature. getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because i am totally brochure reading averse. twenty years ago i was a photographer with big equipment but had given up both. i was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit ",positive

" just returned from a trip to hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test. i was very pleased with the results. this is a powerful lens yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use. i was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (canon eos 20d) and virtually every shot was a keeper. the is feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus. usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one. i shot in both portrait and landscape mode and i didn't see any problems with focus clarity or sharpness. all the images were clean and razor sharp. if you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment i highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.

" this camera is really great. i knew i liked it before but i immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when i ended up with a rebel xt as a loaner while my 20d was in repair. not that the xt is a bad camera it just doesn't really compare to the 20d. the 20d has a nice feel to it; it is fairly large which is great since i have somewhat large hands. the features are great too. and the image quality is awesome. i don't really need to go into all of the details as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job. let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars. the only complaint i have about the camera is that it doesn't have spot metering. the ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d.

" this lens has only two faults. first it is big and heavy--quality construction often yields a heavy lens. second once the photographer has seen the results that this lens can produce there is a likelihood that he or she will be unhappy with the other lenses in the camera bag. results first: the images are razor sharp with this zoom mounted on my nikon d70s. i can get shots that i never could get before because this lens is so crisp that subjects taken at a distance nevertheless can be cropped to produce an acceptable close-up image. subjects taken at more normal distances are breathtakingly sharp--as if shot with an excellent prime lens. this is a fast lens (f/2.8 throughout its entire zoom range). almost more importantly this lens has the best bokeh that i have ever experienced in a lens. bokeh to the extent that i understand the concept (it is a japanese word meaning roughly unfocused) is a word describing whether the out-of-focus portion of an image (i.e. a blurred background in a photo in which only the subject is in focus) has a pleasing look to it. this lens produces wonderful creamy bokeh. the sharpness and bokeh combined with the excellent bright color rendition of this lens makes this one a true classic. i have occasionally experienced minor ghosting on this lens when shooting into a very bright subject i.e. the sun reflecting off of the ocean. this is a normal shortfall of a zoom lens comprised of a multitude of elements and i have sometimes experienced this. but such occasions are rare. the autofocusing action of this lens is very good. even birds at very long distances usually produce a quick snappy autofocus lock on my nikon d70s. very seldom does it hunt for an af lock and these occasions are likely due to operator error rather than the lens. this lens also features vibration reduction (vr) which enables it to produce acceptable images below what an f/2.8 lens would otherwise be suitable for. the vr really works too although it is by no means a panacea for dim lighting. this is one of nikon's professional lenses and the quality of construction is excellent. the critical mount is metal and the entire lens is built like a tank. the lens comes with a nice squeeze-style lens cap and a very good lens hood that can be easily reversed for storage. the reader can see that i am extremely enamored with this lens. the reason is that notwithstanding its bulk and weight this lens produces the best nature shots that i have ever managed to take by far.

" this camera is simply amazing! i started out with a canon g2 and then a canon g6 and then a canon 20d and now this canon 1d mark ii n. i debated and researched for 3 months between the 1ds mark ii 5d and 30d. my decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5d and this 1d mark ii n. yes i wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 mp like the 5d but you know what? it practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally i made my decision to go with this one and i'm 110% glad that i did. for me this camera is definitely the one to get because the 45 point focusing 8.5 fps and the 1d pro body/interface/menu/layout etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor. trust me if you don't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide. because of this 8.5fps alone i'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that i normally get lucky getting with my 20d. and with a 5d at 3fps i just said forget it...no way. i'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living. this is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20d to this camera is out of this world. with the phenomenal auto focusing additional metering it's like i'm now playing with a bentley (with the 1d mk2 n) coming from a mercedes c230 hatchback (the cheapest mercedes that people buy just because it's a mercedes name and they don't want to spend any more money on a real mercedes). this camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro. also i don't shoot action pictures all the time and i do love portrait photography and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures. but even with the 1.3 crop factor there is still a huge improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you won't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you'll have on a 5d. with this 1d mk2 n you can still take wonderful wedding photography landscapes etc. as much as i'd like to have 12.8mp like the 5d 8mp is really all that we need these days unless you're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8x10's or around there. unless you're printing extremely large posters and whatnot you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5d can. the resolution and mp is definitely enough. plus it's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to. the extra bonuses with this camera which i look at as a secondary positive are the weather seals pro-build high quality construction body easy to use and navigate menu system you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times dual memory card capability you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently built-in battery grip (you don't have to shell out extra for this) longer battery life than the other cameras best customization and most options that you can set to your liking more than the 5d or the 20d or 30d. i could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it. otherwise the 5d is also a great choice too if you need to save the money and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments and don't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that's great for ai servo.

" the cover over the lense broke/small lcd screen/ pictures are pritty good/battery life is pritty good/some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady/takes nice portaits/ easy to use/ has a veiw-finder ",positive
" i had a chance to compare it with a tokina glass. canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion same or even slightly worse on a sharpness and complete looser on a build quality. if you are ok with 12mm - get tokina ",positive
" up front: if you're considering this lens stop considering - and buy it. i had occasion to try the tamaron zoom in this range and noticed plastic-y digital qualities in some of the tamaron's highlighted-texture areas. none of that is a problem with this canon beauty. i am using it as my normal lens. the contrast is razor-sharp enough to shave with. it's graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a tv camera. it's also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical abs.... tiny problems include an understandable perspective bulging on subjects about the edges. and there is some blue fringing on very high contrast edges. photoshop nails the latter dead'er than britney spears' career. i've had a need for reasonably large blow-ups with most captures cropped yet still enlarged up to prints that are minimally 13x20. at that size not only does this lens reproduce a subject's pores but you can peer down and see the stuff inside the craters. ",positive
" in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts the d70s has fallen behind the pack. (however if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.) nevertheless it's quite a good camera. what i like about it most: - it looks and feels solid. some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars. it's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it's category. - very good battery life. - backwards compatibility with decade's worth of nikon slr lenses. my gripes: - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week. - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses. - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800. - nikon's raw software and control software aren't included with the camera and are imho overpriced. (...and on top of that nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...) what would improve this camera the most: - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets and then pull them up on the fly. - replacing the idiot modes (i.e. portrait landscape etc.) with modes that you could customize ",positive
" i am a professional photographer and i have owned this camera for nearly two years. i also have a d70 for backup. the batteries go forever it is very quick to respond the images are beautiful and it has the typical nikon durability and reliability. if you are already a nikon user the controls will fall easily to hand. that having been said the computer software with this camera is a joke. for the best image quality shoot raw files color balance with a grey card and render the images with software like capture one le. the uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars. come on nikon be real!!! shortly after i got my first d70 i shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog. i got an ugly feeling in my gut when i was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3/4 figure cropped to the head and shoulders and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog. by the time i found out it was already at the printer. as it turned out i was pleasantly surprised: the cover shot looked great. after that incident i have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results. this camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button. in resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera. it is imperative to shoot raw and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera. i can't wait to try the d80 ",positive
" excellent camera kit. versatile. i have a lot to learn about the camera though as it is no simple point-and-shoot. however in auto mode it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. i look forward to learning how to use it fully. lenses came with warranty cards but the camera itself did not. i bought the sb-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 gb compact flash cards to round out the kit. camera with lens attached is large which i underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. great camera though. price was the best i could find anywhere ",positive
" the digital rebel is the most amazing camera i've ever owned. my previous camera was a canon a90 and i loved using all the features on it [great camera!]. i decided recently that maybe i should graduate to a slr because i was starting to get more creative with my photography. i spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the digital rebel. after a few months of owning it i still am amazed. the image quality is fantastic it's quick and responsive and every day using it i learn a little more. it's the perfect intro slr camera for me because everything makes sense and it's easy to learn. i've gotten amazing shots that i could never dream of getting with a point and shoot. if you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot go for this camera you wont be sorry. ",positive
" i purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05). definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect. there are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera but after a year mine is still working perfectly ",positive
" i am new to slrs and i cant belive how good this camera is. this camera is worth every penny for the amazing quality it produces. i always thot my old digital pics with point and shoot were excellent but looking back they look terrible compared to this. ",positive
" i had 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses. while i had owned other digitals i keep going back to my old rebel until now. we got the back up battery pack. my husband and i love it ",positive
" canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price. i purchased this for a recent trip to grand cayman and cozumel. i didn't go scuba diving on this trip but i did take the camera snorkeling (diving to depths ~20ft). it worked flawlessly and i got some pictures i was very happy with! one thing i did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water. going from ac to the hot humid outdoors my eos rebel fogged up (condensation) and even after 30 minutes i couldn't take good pictures. with the sd110 in the uw housing i just wipped the housing's glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and i was able to take clear pictures. the instructions are pretty good but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the o-ring seal for cleaning/lubing. once i figured it out it wasn't so hard. the sd110 may be getting a little old but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing i don't have so much money tied up in the system that i would be devestated if it was lost or stolen. i will probably upgrade to the sd550 or sd500 (they both use the same batteries as the sd110) with the wp-dc80 or wp-dc70 housing at some time in the near future but i will definitely keep the sd110 and wp-dc10 as backups ",positive
" this small and cheep hood can save you realy a lot of money. it's doeing it job wonderful keeps you pictures brigth and clear but also the hood protect you lens from a lot of things which trying to hit you lens ",positive
" pros: - reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light. - helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches. - somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. better to break the hood than the front element. - makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you. cons: - will increase lens movement in windy situations kind of like a sail on a boat. - takes up more room in your bag even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens. - people take more notice of you will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile ",positive
" nice quality but overpriced. does a nice job of protecting the front of the lens and reducing glare in some situations ",positive
" good basic set of inexpensive filters. nice case. great for a beginner/starting set. if you're willing to spend more money on filters getting b+w or hoya will suit you better. ",positive
" when i bought a digital camera i already knew that i would need rechargeable batteries for it. what i didn't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines. i had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate! so i looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with monster cable's products. it performs better than advertised. the initial charge may have taken 3 hours but subsequent charges have been much quicker. i have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they won't operate the camera. the charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance and has an led indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged. it is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it. i have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger ",positive
" i bought one of these for my canon sd-800 and can recommend it. for many years now i've carried canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose. my only criticism of the canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media. i was hoping that with the tiny size of sd cards canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases but they haven't. on the plus side the case retains the superior leather construction uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of velcro or a snap and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body. the package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera. incidentally the sd-800 is well matched to the case fitting quite securely ",positive
" this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras. it fits in the pocket easily. i'm satisfied ",positive
" excellent case no question about it. it is stylish and well-put together. this can not be worn on a belt though it must go in a pocket purse or in your hand. the main thing is that it keeps the awesome camera safe and sound and it looks good doing it. ",positive
" case is pretty much what you see...i have no complaints. =) the case protects my camera very well ",positive
" photos were excellent. but photo print quality depends very much on the print shop. for the same photo file it can look like a 4m photo when taken to a below quality printer shop. photos taken indoor with marginal lighting (no flash used) turned out to be yellowish. battery life is very long despite its large 3 lcd. battery charging time is over 3 hours - too long. photos files viewed on computer looks just great. 8'x10' prints are great but have not tried larger prints. touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set. date on photo is red (would be better if it is black). and the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner ",positive
" the camera is a superb light-weight wonder. the controls are logical and the large display area is amazing. i love it. ",positive
" i've had my d70s for about a year now haven't regretted it for a second. the controls are laid out logically with everything to hand. the dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate. i personally love the optional grid overlay i have no excuses for horizons that aren't horizontal. the wireless flash system is great though you have to buy an sb-600 or sb-800 to get the full benefit. this camera is bigger and heavier than the d50 and d80 which in my opinion is a positive thing. ",positive
" i do weddings portrait and outdoor photography and i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch from the d70 (other than the d80 :). this camera is professional grade at the consumer price point. don't be scared by the 6.1 mp. i print at 20x30 all the time w/ out any problems. i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual ",positive
" this uv filter does it job to protect the lens well. the build is solid (metal construction). the glass is also descent quality. about the performance it absorbs some uv light. the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable probably the sky 1-a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me. now about the one problem which is the internal reflection. i've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). to put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand) when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture) the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). and if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time a lamp at nightime is often very bright. but the point that i'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time. additionally the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations. hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do). i'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens. and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet. i use this filter on my 50mm f/1.8d lens and on my 18-55mm lens. ",positive
" this filter is an excellent cost efficient way to protect your valuable lenses. ",positive
" if you are looking for a great all around camera this is it! our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all. also love the last 4 feature gets some great action shots. we had the fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me. love the new manual zoom (if you like 35mm lenses your like this) as well as the battery drain. i used to have to replace batteries every day now its more like once a week with the amount we use it. my other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where i forget to put it back in the camera after downloading! so there is always one in there!. the video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots. in general without spending a lot more you get a great camera that keeps up with an active picture happy family ",positive
" i'm using it for a few months now; i haven't found a single problem so far. earlier i was using an old finepix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment. this is not a problem any more. also i was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom. in general i was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out :-). sure there are better cameras on the market; however considering the price it is just a great deal ",positive
" i went from taking the camera out of its packing to taking professional quality pictures in twenty minutes. it's amazing ",positive
" these cameras are as simple to use as any i have ever seen and the quality of the pictures are as good or better than cameras costing 3 times as much. great buy ",positive
" the quality is definitely great. when attached to the s3 is it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots. if you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography i suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood ",positive
" i use my canon 10d mainly for astrophotography. most of the time it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods of time anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes. this ack-e2 adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or a drained one while i control the camera remotely sitting inside my house. continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flash storage. the package included several ac power connectors which is very useful while travelling. amazon provides a wide range of items to choose from. ",positive
" compare to the price of the product i highly recommend to any one who own canon eos camera... ",positive
" i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens. at $80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars. the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses ",positive
" this is a fabulous and reliable camera. feels solid. fantastic pictures. easy to operate. a new d40 has been announced over the past few days but its lack of an lcd display and buttons to manage basic camera controls (to reduce weight and make it more user friendly) would still make this my recommended nikon dslr. expect prices to fall as the d40 becomes available ",positive
" i am not a photographer but i enjoy taking good pictures. i never had a digital slr before; the camera i had before the d50 was a nikon coolpix (a compact one). i thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro. i realized that it was even better than what i expected (maybe because i was coming from a nikon coolpix). the colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good. the d50 is among the cheapest digital slr's and at the same time it is a very serious product. i don't think the d50 is much inferior to the canon rebel even if the canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution. i used both the d50 (which i own) and the rebel (at my school) and i think the d50 feels much more like a pro camera when you hold it in your hands while the rebel feels more like a toy. the lenses provided in the package are good but are basic. according to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80 but i think i should have bought the 55-200 as well: 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take. also the 18-135 that nikon sells with the d80 looks good to me but they don't make a kit with those lenses for the d50. the last thing that really amazes me is the .nef format (nikon's raw format). it is impressive how quickly you can improve a .nef picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse. if you want a good camera and you don't want to spend too much money for it i think this is the best choice ",positive
" i purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4x. just keep in mind--1.4x is only 40% better. it worked really well but didn't increase the zoomage enough. i decided to go with a 2x (that's twice the zoomage) teleconverter by kenko instead. i gave this one to my brother-in-law for christmas. you have to think about what you want--i want to get in really close to the birds. i have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm. it is an improvement but not nearly enough! if you want to get twice as close this isn't going to do it for you. if you want to get half-again-as close this almost gets you there. as far as quality the quality is definitely there. five stars for quality 3 for insufficient zoomage ",positive
" my first digicam bought it 2 years ago. simple to use great pictures and a year ago (and hundreds of pictures ago) i dropped it (no in its case) on a cobblestone road - no damage. have never seen the need to replace it. i like the common batteries it uses and the sd memory ",positive
" aside form the fact that canon charges an arm and a leg for a 1 dollar piece of plastic the remote switch does work well. it does not feel very sturdy and does not seem nearly as well built as the canon cameras. people with big hands may have a little trouble using this product. overall a must have addition for anyone interested in long exposures images with excellent sharpness and depth of field ",positive
" it is simple handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera. but i am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks... this wired release would be the choice only if you are not a digital rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button. ",positive
" i honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars. the moment i got it i was delighted with the quality of the pictures (except in very dark places - which is why the review gets minus 1 star) and by its portability. i've dropped it abused it took it to countless parties countries and it is now full of scratches and bumps (get the camera case!) and guess what: it still works as perfectly as the first day i got it. this little piece of technology is amazing so if you're looking for something affordable and with a great picture quality (for us amateurs of course) just go for it. actually i even took quite a few gorgeous pictures with it. i even love it and rely on it so much that i won't change it even now that it looks all messed up. don't think twice. just go for it ",positive
" had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it have'nt regretted it one bit. this lens is clear with excellent color saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing. coupled with an external flash it's great indoors as well. have been using it as my everyday walk around lens. zoom range is excellent(rebel xt/xti 1.6 magnification). though it's somewhat on the big side it won't tire you out carrying it around your neck. purchased the hood seperately which for the money should have came with the lens. anyway this lens offers excellent value for the money and you won't regret the investment ",positive
" this is the first is lens that i've owned. i had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that i took the step up. keep in mind that tis is an ef not ef-s lens. this makes its effective focal length about 45-215mm on my digital rebel. i love the zoom range (great for shooting action shots of kids without getting in their faces) and the ability to easily control the depth of field on my nature shots. just uploaded some of my recent shots with this lens under share your own customer images. pete leclair http://www.agentz.com/digitalimagesbyjpl ",positive
" from all the reviews i read i expected certain pros and cons from this lens. i was not disappointed. pros: very sharp lens with very good colors cons: vignetting at wide open and a little too contrasty for myself the pros outweighed the cons for the price. it is ideal for the 1.6 multiplier cameras where it becomes a 38mm lens ",positive
" this kit is a must have for any of the compatible canon cameras. digital camera rule #1: always carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for that alone. the leather case is great: stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera. the neck strap is quite strong and looks good too. it may not be everyone's cup of tea but i like it. it comes in handy when i need quick access to the camera and don't want to fumble through pockets or bags ",positive
" i've had my d2h for 9 months now. i've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great. it seems this issue plagued a minority of users. camera is very fast exposes well and delivers results. it's primarily designed to be a sports and photojournalism camera -- for situations where speed counts. it's a 4 megapixel wonder -- it's true it only has 4 megapixels but they are 4 great megapixels. images upsize wonderfully. i love my unit and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup or wait for the d2x. the price of the d2x is making that decision a bit easier and i'm leaning toward another d2h.

" i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography. i bought the 17-85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in raw. i also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound. i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there! strongly recommend. pay the extra $$$ and get this over the rebel xti. you won't be disappointed ",positive
" i upgraded from the canon digital rebel (grey body) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level. one thing i like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall ",positive
" the philips digital frame truly stands out from all other digital pictures frames that i've gotten. the resolution and picture quality superb and the sleek outer design is an additional plus. also the picture frame can be charged and last a couple of hours without a cord which is very convenient. as another reviewer said you have to scroll through your entire collection one-by-one on your memory card in order for you to get to the picture you want. it would be more convenient if you could skip through pages or have a blackberry type rolling scroll on the side of the frame to speed through if you needed to. also i would like to see philips next frame include a flashdrive slot as well that way we can upload pictures from our computers to the usb flash drive and directly insert the flash drive into the frame without tranferring them onto a memory card. thank you ",positive

" i am very happy with the resulting prints from this camera. i've used other brands in the past and never have had such bright colors and in focus shots. the winding mechanism is easy to use. finally i have pictures of my diving expeditions to remember. it's even suited for kids over ten to use. mine had lots of fun with their own quick snap ",positive
" this camera is perfect for me i have a [...] an a [...] an it always seems there doing something ide like to catch on film. this camcorder is small enough that some days i have it in my jacket pocket an the instant on makes it really easy to catch them moments that are usually gone by the time you get them big cameras out of the bag an ready to go. also it can extract a still picture out of a video clip so them candid shots are never missed. the settings for this camera are really easy to understand an use. it takes really good video's an pictures although ive not taken alot of still pictures because i like to extract that perfect picture out of a video clip. this camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc. ive got a few 2 gig cards so ive always have one in the camera ready to go. the battery does not last a long time so i recommend a couple extra there pretty cheep here on amazon an it usually takes one battery to download onto pc if you have it hooked up to your pc for any lengh of time. i dont know anything about camera's an how they work i just like to take the pictures an so far this has been the easiest camera /camcorder ive seen ",positive
" i received the xacti a few weeks ago and it's performing like i hoped it would. the controls are a very simple and intuitive. all the required hardware is included. does not require any additional software to run on mac or windows. i have a macbook with boot camp running windows xp pro. the camera works easily with either platform. it is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive. i am using a sandisk 2gb sd memory card. another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real-time like you would have to with minidv. the quality may not be the same as minidv but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference. the quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it's just a camera by it's small size. my old camera was a 2 mega pixel canon powershot a60. this is rated at 6 mega pixel. you can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies. when filming movies the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers. this is my first camcorder so i can't really compare to anything else (except my old camera) but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away ",positive
" i going to write the for non techs out there... i can use it my wife can use it my mom can use it and my 5 year old son can use it. it is just that simple to use. you do not need to know anything about taking shots other than how to zoom and pick the right settings and if you play with the camera for a few days you will know them. one other reviewer said to get the following: 1. at least a 512 mb memory stick pro duo to take 160 or so pictures in one go 2. rechargeable aa batteries and a charger 3. case and i must say yes yes and yes... to all they are a must... this camera feels good in your hands screen size is great. you can see the screen in both sunlight and at nights. the menu is very easy to follow and the quality of the picture are clean and clear. i can't comment on the software that comes with the camera as i have a apple computer and i use iphoto. for the price i felt like i got a $[...] sony...

" i'm a former 35mm photographer who's a little older and not as spry as i once was and i eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere i went. i got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more. digital slr's are pricey and as a friend pointed out i'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her. she recommended this model and the more i looked at it the more i liked it. it is a fixed lens model but with a 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need. it start up fast zooms and focuses internally so there is no moving barrel to have to hold on to. it has just about every feature an advanced amateur could want. it does macro. and it has an optical stablization system that works as advertised. so far i haven't come across anything that it can't do. this is a nice unit for an advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want to go full digital slr yet.

" for the price paid this is a great camera. should last me for a long time. debated buying a slr but this seems to have all the features of an expensive slr (actually it is a slr just no interchangable lenses) and a lot easier to use ",positive
" i am only an amateur photographer but still . . . this small camera with the long nose gives performance one might expect from an slr film camer costing a lot more and a lot more complicated to use. i caught the digital bug sevearl years ago. my latest before this beauty was a simple little canon sureshot 3mp. a great camera but this camera has the same simplicity but takes pictures which are much more refined in terms of sharpeness for not much more than i paid for that camera four years ago!! this panasonic lumix has a leica lens which can' t be matched by any other camera but it's twin leica camera--a much more expensive piece of equipment. the long lens might put you off if you are an average family photog but if you want an all around 35mm-12x camera without a huge heavy expensive bag of lenses like me this baby is for you. it only looks massive. it is quite lite and manageable. i use it for bird photographsy but it could be great for any situation where you need to get really close up in just about any lighting situation with ultra-fine resolution. don't want to spend mega bucks for a mega-camera? this is the answer. i love it and i think your will too. easy to use and easy on the wallet. if you're not quite there try the next model down with the same focal length but 6 mp for a couple hundred less. another terrific buy. no i don't work for panasanic. i'm a retired print editor. jim isha ",positive

" being in hawaii i spend plenty of time in the water...so having an underwater housing for my camera is almost a necessity. i have been very happy with the results shooting in the water (snorkeling etc) and above the water (surf footage-just watch out for water spots on the lens). some of my photos are up for view in other parts of the page for this housing. i treat things pretty roughly and have been using this for about a year with no problems. and i am in the water with it on an almost daily basis. i like being able to use all the features of the camera (minus downloading images or changing the battery or cf card) while the camera is in the housing-something you cannot always say when looking at aftermarket housings that are non-canon manufactured. everything mates up cleanly and works great i am very happy with my purchase. just remember to rinse it off/soak it in freshwater after taking it in the ocean or the pool to keep the corrosion at bay and put a little light silicone grease on the o-ring for trouble free use ",positive

" i just bought this waterproof case in order to use my canon s410 on a scuba diving trip. i was a little nervous at first (i could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone!) but i have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably! i used it on 6 dives and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet. i did not have one leak! a word of caution--i followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel (just a small amount). i would like to think that the camera would not leak without this but i did not want to take any chances. i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach ",positive
" 300 plus minutes of recording time (without lcd). i still got several hours with the lcd backlight on. for when you are out all day this is a good long lasting battery. on the hdr-fx1 i found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting. that helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me. i can't say i noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height though i didn't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time ",positive

" bought this camera to replace my 35mm camera. am pleased with the trade up that i made. the shape is similar to my old film camera. thought this would make it easier to adjust to the smaller size of it. it has made the transition relatively smooth. i'm sure there are smaller cameras out there but this one is small enough. the display is also a good size - bigger than most that i looked at. i am not a genius at computers so i was concerned that i would need to adapt to downloading pictures from the camera to the pc. but all i need to do is plug in the cord and click a button. very easy to follow any instructions. i did notice that the display freezes for a second or two after a picture is taken. this is not generally a problem for me as most pictures are posed shots. i did run into some lag time during an easter egg hunt this past weekend but still managed to get about a dozen good shots. overall i like the camera and only wish i had gotten up the courage to go digital sooner ",positive
" i bought my canon a540 recently from amazon and am completely satisfied. i added a 1gb sd card for $11 from ebay and a charger with 4 2500nimh aa batteries from the supermarket. the images are clear and large. you have the options of full automatic various manual settings up to full manual and a wide selection of preprogrammed modes. at work we needed a new camera to record tiny scratches and imperfections in our manufactured product so i took my camera in to demo. using the standard lens (a macro lens is available but i don't have it yet) we photographed a quarter using only ambient light. in less than a minute we had the image on the screen and were able to blow it up until the date filled the screen and still maintain good detail. as a result we are now buying one for work with a macro accessory lens. i totally recommend it as an excellent all rounder ",positive
" when i purchased this camera i was really conflicted on wheather i should get a digital still camera or a digital video camera. so when i decided still and found out the canon powershot had a video feature i was pleased but had very low expectations. boy was i suprised! this camera has so many fun features for both still and video pics. and the quality is awesome for both! there is a video email option so you don't have to guess if your videos are going to fit into an email. but if you want you can create some really good quality video with a quick adjustment. and all of it transfers easily to my computer. plus with still pics there are lots of easy features to choose from so you can quickly set up for any kind of shooting sinario.

" i purchased this camera for shooting product photos for our website. i had been using a nikon coolpix at 5mp and wanted something relatively low cost with higher mp for the next few years. we plan to purchase something totally outlandish in a few years for super-quality printed photos but for now this camera is an excellent investment. easy and small enough for everyone in the company to carry on trips abroad but inexpensive enough to not break our hearts if pocket-picked or eaten by a hyena. i've read some reviews that talk about blurred photos...i'm really surprised. i began using ours after i had my son so many photos were taken without a tripod one hand holding a nursing child and the other shooting photos...and none of the images turned out blurry. i have taken a few photos of my son now that he's a six-month-old super action hero that look like cotton candy on my nikon but turn out crystal clear on the sony. the movie mode is a real plus. i'm actually on this page today because i'm looking to buy one of these for my personal use with video recording in mind. we have a digital video camera but with plenty of 1g memory cards in hand i'd rather record action with this camera--the quality and sound are worlds better. this is a lovely little low-cost camera that's suitable for a wide range of users. i love it ",positive
" good camera for the $129 i paid. does everything pretty well and your picture modes are pretty customizable. only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than i wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.

" we canoe/kayak down various rivers and creeks. i wanted a way to take my $1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it. the sports pack is completely water proof (up to 7m). i've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry. the case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality. it is relatively simple to operate and assemble. you have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used. my only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area. so far i haven't had any problems but i've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs. all told i'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water i would recommend this case ",positive
" it is rated for 5 meters but i took it to 9 and there were no sings of moisture or a single drop. the antifogging solution provided works for more than an hour. the microphone records sound well. i have a high def cam and the s.pack did not decrease image quality inside or outside the water. in the specs it is stated that its buoyancy is positive and by experience i recomend to buy a weight for it to avoid the camera going up in the water while you push and push down - even more snorkeling. there are special weights that are mounted to the enclosure using the trypod whole. i would say a 14-18 onz it fine. it is a great item ",positive
" it is easy to mount and puts out a surprising amount of ligh ",positive
" for its size and price this little light can't be beat. very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors. i think this is a must have for camcorder owners. my vhs family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy so i see this as a miniscule investment for the long-term return. ",positive
" in short i love it. the xh a1 is a professional looking camera and has all the features you need. it is a bit complex for those who are not true prosumers or pros and the manual is not consumer oriented. the picture qualitity is so far the best i've seen in non-pro cameras. the 3 ccds at 1/3 inch each are truely spectacular. the 2 external xlr connections are the reason i looked at this camera. if you want to mic someone via wireless or wired lav mic this is the camer to do that. just make sure you read over the xlr connection settings in the manual a few times and change the buttons (unfortunately located in 4 different locations on the camera) to the right settings. a set of good headphones is a must-have when not using the wonderful built-in mic. by the way this built-in mic eliminated one of the situations where i always needed a mic a close up interview situation--the built-in is very sensitive and accurate for this type of thing. the downside to this camera is really only that it does not contain an hdmi adapter. sadly canon did not provide one; instead they opted for a custom (hdmi-looking) adpater that if you loose the cable you can't run down to fry's or radio shack to get another one. :( the other thing is that it is 1440x1080 instead of 1920x1080. their new canon hv20 ( a 1ccd camera due in april 2007) is 1920x1080 resolution--just seems odd to me. but then i'm the guy that will get a 10 megapixel camera simply because its better resolution. :) the bottom line don't get the sony fx7 get this one. the sony seems and is easier to use but it doesn't have an external xlr jack it uses 1/4 inch ccds and in a side-by-side test doesn't offer as good performance in low light situations as this one. the camera is a bit complicated but if you're willing to learn it is a wonderful tool. if you need true point and shoot i'd wait and get the canon hv20 ",positive
" i looked at this camera the panasonic hvx200 the sonys the jvc 200 and even canon's bigger brother the x1. i found this one to have fantastic reviews on dvinfo.net a great video forum. my concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction- there really isn't a difference. i like tape vs the hvx's expensive storage solutions. one concern i had was will it look like a pro camera? that is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent. as soon as i opened the box i was in love! this is a really substantial camera. especially with the opt wide angle from canon and the matte box provided this does not look like your mama's camcorder. i really like the manual controls so that you don't have to go thru menus to change parameters. the layout of everything is great. i really like the dual on/off and zoom controls- top of handle plus rear right side. holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned. only down side- and it is incidental. the matte box is a bit flimsy- lightweight plastic. that helps with weight but i worry about breaking it. some may say that hdv codec is not as good as dvcpro but my eye does not see it. the colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light. if you are looking for point and shoot this is not your baby but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price- this is it ",positive

" i don't like pink so i bought the blue bag. i had bought a black one but it was so skimpy i returned it and prayed until this one arrived. i had no trouble with amazon crediting me for the return either. it was so cute! i'm too old for cute but i kept it because i needed a case for my new hp r717. it is small yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it. i have dropped my camera and it was not injured. it has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera not the big aa batteries but the flat type that come with my r717. i recommend this little bag or the pink one even if you don't like pink...or blue. they are well cushioned and snug but not too snug you think they will tear. the are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures ",positive

" i bought this for my new hdv fx1 camcorder and it works great. unlike the century wide-angle lens this is fully zoom-through. lens is .8x which is less than the century and others but just about right for hd--since the fx1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out this just gives it an extra boost converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm. also very little barrel distortion. in all a great lens. only drawback is that it's a big (heavy) lens but then hey it's for a serious prosumer camcorder ",positive
" i recently purchased this camera. it arrived one day before i was due to fly out to palm springs. i took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures. this may or may not be because i am a novice photographer. even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry but all others came out better than i ever expected. i think once i play around with it my night time pictures will improve but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me. no regrets with this purchase though. also buy a larger memory stick. the one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and i had to run out and buy another.

" i purchased this camera so i could photograph wildlife on hikes. i needed something that was not too heavy was image-stabilized with telephoto power. this camera meets all those requirements. it does have one problem however. in bright light the viewfinder blanks out so one cannot clearly see the object to be photographed. i have solved that problem to some extent by pointing the camera at the object and letting the autofocus do the rest. this fix has resulted in many excellent photos. like many other small cameras the results tend to be contrasty and i modify this tendency in photoshop ",positive
" i love my new canon a710. large lcd makes taking pictures easy to frame color and sharpness is good all around and needing only 2 aa batteries is great. i no longer need to search and buy special camera batteries i can go into any drug store. only draw back on this camera is the size of the memory card 16mb. for a few bucks more put in at least a 1gig. overall rating for a camera in this price range - above average ",positive
" overall i am quite satisfied with the usability and photo quality of the canon a 710 is. this camera was an upgrade from my 3-year-old hp 935 -- the old guy still worked fine but was very slow and didn't handle low-light situations very well at all. i was also looking for a bigger zoom range. after weighing the options i decided that the a 710 is was the way to go. pros: - uses standard aa batteries. invaluable when you're on the go and need more juice. also the battery life has been very good - i'm using the same aa rechargables i used for over a year in my old camera and i routinely get 2-4 days usage from them before needing to recharge. - huge lcd screen that doesn't suck power. fast response too. - digital zoom that actually helps! because the camera is 7.1 mp and has an image stabilizer i can actually get usable images even at the full 24x combined zoom. very impressed. - very wide range of available settings. you can customize almost any aspect of this camera from sounds to shutter speed to flash speed/brightness to focus to.... - big enough and small enough. it will fit in my back pocket most of the time but it's big enough to remind me that it's there before i sit down. - fast processing time. taking a 3 or 4 minute video and having it ready to go again in less than 5 seconds is a true novelty to me -- my old hp took forever! the fast processor also helps in viewing the images on the camera - you can scroll through very quickly and also jump to an image very quickly too. much better than previous canon models even. - memory backup battery. remembers what day it is time it is and what image you're on -- even if you take the regular aa's out. very useful. - fast start-up time. it's ready to take a picture right after you turn it on especially if you bypass the welcome image sound and screen. - cool features like color swap and color select. also there's an option for when the camera is connected to your computer to set any image as your computer's wallpaper with just the press of a button on the camera. the camera also allows you to use the digital zoom while taking video a nice touch. - you can change lenses and add filters very easily. cons: - as i mentioned earlier one of the reasons i upgraded from the hp was to have better luck with low-light situations. i've had the camera now for just over a month and i still haven't figured out the best setting for clear low-light photos -- something that was very easy to do with older canon models say the a 510. as mentioned there is a wide range of settings available which can also be a negative if you don't know quite what you're looking for. - no action setting. similar to above the one setting i miss the most from other canons is that action setting. this camera requires you to set it manually. - video file sizes. a typical 4-minute clip can run upwards of 200 mb -- making it almost impossible to send via email or upload anywhere online. also takes up a good chunk of a 1mb memory card really quickly. canon would have done better to use mpeg-4 here instead of avi. - similarly the video quality doesn't reflect the large file size in most cases though the sound quality is very good. - the big lcd is great but is very hard to see outside in the sun. it does have a backup optical viewfinder but using that puts your nose up against that lcd and leaves a nice smudge on it if you're not careful. - buttons are still somewhat confusing after a month of use but that's relatively minor and will undoubtedly pass with time. - bundled software does not offer the ability to resize your images -- i have to go back through the old hp software if i want to take an image down from 3000 pixels wide to 600! overall as mentioned the camera is a huge improvement from my old hp and even with all of those little annoyances i'm sure the camera would be a perfect fit for pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog. it's no slr but it's getting there. and you certainly can't beat the price ",positive
" for years now i have been buying bargain cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one. finally i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex-z600. this camera is awesome. the screen is huge the picture quality is great it is easy to use and is sooo small. overall a great buy. the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock. luckily i have an sd card reader so i normally just use that to download my pictures ",positive
" after a week of testing this camcorder i found it good enough for daily use. the hd2 does not come with an sd card so make sure you buy one before or at the time you get the hd2. i got a 2gb sd a-data and a 4gb sdhc qpi class6. both worked fine. the 4gb gives me about 1:20h in standardhd mode and 55mns in superhd mode. i didn't notice a speed difference between a class2 and a class6 sd card using the hd2 i think you should be fine with an 8gb sdhc class2. my first impression of the camera is how small it is however it may not fit in a jean pocket. it turns on very quick you can start filming within 2secs of startup. it has a lady voice telling the mode you are using (ie camera mode) not sure if this is useful for others but not for me. the video and still pictures are great outdoor. the video quality is impressive during a bright sunlight. in a room lighten by a 60w equivalent fluo light the video quality is grainy/noisy this has been confirmed by other people as well. the high sensitivity feature (to boost the image quality at low light) helps but not enough. my 7yrs old sony digital8 does a better job at 1lux. i noticed that video quality is grainy at low light but 7mp still picture quality is very good for the same lighting. compared to my new canon sd800 at 7mp it is obvious the canon digital camera wins. on the video side i played with several configuration iso setting white balance resolution etc... it does helps but the video is still grainy at low light. this camcorder has not been designed for low light filming. i ran into an issue when transfering the video & pictures from the hd2 with its cradle to the pc via usb connection. i got errors transfering the files if you use the craddle (this will freeze the hd2). i am not sure why i have to check with sanyo on this. if you connect the hd2 directly to the pc (without the cradle) the transfer goes smooth. so there is an issue with the cradle and usb port. i am also using pinnacle studio 10.5 for my video editing. so far i have not been able to use it and control my hd2. you can however copy the files from sd to your pc and use these files with pinnacle studio. since i film most of the time outdoor during daytime this camera does the job fine and video quality is great. i would still give a 5 stars even with the video issues at low light.

" the zr500 and other low-end canon camcorders appear to be very fine products well worth their price -- but if what you want is the simplest and easiest way to make perfectly acceptable amateur-level home videos have a look at the rca small wonder. simple rugged totally easy to learn and operate no frills but still some very neat features takes perfectly adequate videos of your children your dog whatever -- and about half the price. bought one; totally satisfied ",positive
" this case was well thought out for snorkeling/diving and using your own digital camera without going to the expense of a really expensive camera. definitely a better choice than using those throw-away underwater cameras or renting one. the only drawback is that it triples the size of the great 720sw camera - since size is one of its strongpoint ",positive
" i bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends. i have had if for more than one year and it has performed above expectations under all conditions. the 1 minute video feature is great and was an unexpected bonus (since i didn't know about it when i bought it off amazon). the camera works great with iphoto and macos x. i bought a 512 mb card for it and so far it has been great. both my father and my father in law have the previous powershot s400 and they have had no problems with it. i figure at some point i'll have to change the battery because lithium-ions lose 20% capacity per year but so far it has worked flawlessly.

" i am not a professional photographer. i just happen to be a grandson of one. i use a fully manual canon tx slr for my work. so far i've shot 5 rolls of this stuff. every time there has been something wrong with the camera/me/lighting. every time i got a usable and sometimes great print. this film has a huge exposure latitute (you can really screw up and still get an image) when i show these prints to others they look at me funny and say &quot;this is iso 400?&quot; it has really fine grain. and because it's iso 400 you can use it for almost anything (i got usable prints after shooting a soccer game: my camera was set at iso 100 and there were light leaks in the camera door). it's a great film although i'm told the royal gold it replaces is still better. pick up a pack of this and see what you get. you'll be amazed ",positive

" this camera does everything it says; yes it's waterproof and i was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time!! only reason i didn't give it 5 stars: it is as slow as every other digital camera i've owned as far as focusing multiple flashes and then actually shooting. you get your subject's attention and they smile frozen as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken (in low light.) i was especially intrigued by its bright capture technology but it honestly doesn't seem any different in low light than my old sony u20 2mp tiny little snapshot camera. still that same flash-in-the-dark look. there is a fill-flash low light program mode (among many many others) but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob even if you hold your breath and try to remain still. my ideal snapshot camera is portable durable quick easy and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes. this camera has 3.5 out of those 5. it is way portable very durable easy produces ok results but you have to mess with settings if you're not in daylight and it's not very quick. overall i am very happy with the purchase and will carry it everywhere ",positive
" i can not find anything negative to say about this camera. i wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as casio's exislim. even though this camera is not as small as the casio it is far superior of a camera. size why's it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it isn't awkward or difficult to use. the pictures from this camera turn out spectacular the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera. the lcd screen is also very clear unlike the casio and other camera's similar to this one. you can't go wrong with this camera. highly recommended ",positive

" i bought this for my mother-in-law who is in her 80s and set it up for her. it's quite easy if you're already computer literate and the controls are very user friendly as well. the software could use a few tweaks to make it not look so basic but for someone like my mother-in-law it works well. wish i had a docking station for my nikon.

" the philips 8-inch digital picture frame is an excellent high-quality device. very easy to get it going - the included cable and computer software make it simple to select digital pictures already stored on your computer and copy them onto the device. no need to mess around with memory cards - although the device accepts those as well if that works best for you. everyone who has seen ours loves it. it looks great and the picture quality and size are excellent ",positive
" this is a fabulous gift for grandparents if you preload the pictures. just be aware that the customer support folks are not that knowledgeable probably since the product is new. don't bypass their software to load the pix if you're transferring from your pc to the frame - their software reduces the memory needed for each one. and even though the software for different size frames is labelled the same it is not compatible and you can only have one version installed on your pc at a time ",positive

" i bought this camera more than half a year ago. my intention was to get a decent camera for images but then also be able to use it for filming short movies. i'm very pleased with its performance. in good lighting conditions colors come out to be amazing. i really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling! in darker conditions well it still works fine not nearly as bad as i expected from some other reviews. photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people. as about filming it's terrific. i mean resolution is great (sth like 848 by 640 or so) better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera. and the quality is super awesome looks very neat on computer screen. respect. it has to be pointed out that you cannot zoom while filming but not many cameras out there can do that. oh it's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life. a great buy ",positive

" after buying this camera i was pleased for the most part as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good. it's a sleek smooth design with minimal buttons thus little confusion. there are 3 things however that i'm not happy with. one is that it takes double a batteries and eats them up really fast. the second thing is that there's no secondary viewfinder just the lcd screen. the lcd screen is large which is great.. but this is why the battery life is so low. you can't turn the lcd screen off so batteries go fast. the third and final thing i dislike about it is that there's no ac adaptor so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the tv not using it to take pictures you have to run it on batteries. that is unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt ac plug which is neither on the vivitar website or anywhere else online that i can find made specifically for this camera. i'm a little upset that it came with no adapter as that would be so useful for a camera that eats up batteries. i reccomend rechargibles if you're going to get this camera ",positive
" i've had this camera for a couple of weeks now it's my 4th digital camera. i am very happy with the photos i'm able to take they are truly outstanding. i'm still learning all of the settings but i'm finding everything to be user-friendly. i like the way it feels in my hand and i'm pleased with the battery life. i purchased a 2gb card to replace the one that came with the camera and it's been the perfect size for me. the video is amazing i was standing in the upstairs bathroom of our 2 story house and saw our little one jumping on the trampoline at the far end of our backyard so i decided to tape it. not only was the quality good the camera picked up the audio which i never expected! and i like that you can zoom in or out while you're taping i wasn't able to do that with my last camera. i've had no problems downloading the pics or videos to my computer and the prints i've gotten have been great as well ",positive
" we had a canon powershot s50 3 years ago loved it. so this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera we specifically looked for canons. we originally were thinking of getting the sd700800 or something like that. but after we compared these cameras together in a store near us. we found out sd900 has the finest lcd display more opitions in control panel... so we came back and bought it from amazon (our favorite online store). we used it in our last trip to grand cayon lv sf etc. this sd900 takes very good pictures especially in good lighting conditions. colors are also smooth and rich. the downside as you may already read from others' reviews no battery indication no raw(it's ok my husband doesn't do much editiing anyway it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer) control panel is sensitive... don't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and couldn't figure the way out during the time of shooting. stich is a great function which comes with but when in a very bright area you can not see the stich alignment very well on the lcd screen (i guess it's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on lcd dispay). overall it's a wonderful camera we love it. it's my husband's camera i uses canon 350d but i borrow it from my husband sometimes because it's tiny compares to my 10 lbs moose and it takes very good pictures.

" at 10mp this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures i have ever taken with a digital camera. the clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera. the display although pooh-poohed by others as too small is quite large to me. the cameras small lithe design is another selling point. nothing bulky about this camera. you can put it in your front pants-pocket if you needed to. do yourself a favor and get this camera. you won't regret it.

" i needed a new camera to replace my very old digital camera so i ordered this one and could not be happier with it. it has all kinds of features including some manual control options like white balance etc. for those people who like to mess with that stuff (i'm more of an auto person myself). i used it on vacation last month and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of pictures after taking only a few test shots to get familiar with the camera. the camera is very easy to use and gives you a basic user manual to get you started and also a detailed manual to help you find out how everything works on the camera. the movie mode works good too. the colors come out bright and vivid. the lag time between pictures is minimal which is one of the main things i hated about my old 1.3mp panasonic palmcam and the 7.1mp makes for some excellent detail in your pictures. the only bad thing about the camera in my opinion is that it doesn't have a movement stabilizer (or whatever it is called) so it can be prone to shaking especially when you zoom using the digital zoom. i like that the camera is small and lightweight but it is not one of those super thin ones that you feel like you could break in half. overall i think this is a great camera and i don't think you can find a better camera for the price ",positive

" i really did some research on digital cameras even tried out a sony but the canon brand is by far one of the best. i don't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera it does most of the work! i like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not iso aperature and all that jazz. the settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true. the digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry. there are so many features on this camera too many to list. i even found a great deal at best buy on a 2 gig memory card i get over 1000 photos with a high resolution! it takes alkaline batteries but i bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time. i am sooo happy with this camera i take it with me everywhere even a couple of days to work.

" the canon underwater housings are designed to protect your camera from the elements whether they are sand rain pool or ocean. for use on the beach while snorkeling or taking shots of your kids in a pool there is little or no need to worry about the buoyancy of your camera housing. if you free dive or scuba dive you do not want your camera housing floating out of your hands. these weights are an easy way to adjust the buoyancy of your housing. the kit comes with four weight plates so you can fine tune your housing's buoyancy. i prefer a heavier setup and have added an extra plate compared to what was recommended by canon. i'm very happy with the setup and they are very easy to use.

" i bought my k10d in dec 06 after owning a number of pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering. the combination of features if executed properly make this camera the best buy in 10mp dslrs right now. i postponed my review because i wanted to get some real field experience. i just went to mexico and panicked because i left the camera instruction manual behind. i can now report on that trip. i did a little fumbling at first mainly because i didn't have the manual but i was soon able to find the combinations i wanted and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively. the af button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed. i found myself in difficult lighting situations often and both af and exposure metering worked quite well. i also took some hand-held shots that i normally would use a tripod with (such as at 450mm) and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement. in a few cases i used bracketing and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots. exposure metering worked so well that i stopped bracketing. i particularly liked the display modes: i could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was soft or not right at the scene. the rechargeable li ion batteries although not readily available in stores seem to last forever (even using power zoom and full-bright display and some fill flash). i believe that i could have shot all week (700 shots in raw (dng) + jpeg) with the battery grip attached. in summary this camera was a pleasure to hold very easy to use and manipulate and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos (even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer). i bought it because of its compatibility with pentax lenses 10mp sensor shake-reduction technology larger display and especially the dust and water seals. but what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results. i am still discovering its features but i already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past. some of the features on this camera are unique (new program lines) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more making the k10d a good choice and a best buy. once again for pentax the engineering is supurb.

" a little background first... this was an upgrade camera for me just over a year ago. i was in 35mm format for over 20 years. i used a pentax k1000 body and several different lenses tele-converters and filters. at work i've had 4 years experience with a fuji fine pix 2mp point-and-shoot. it was provided by my work and was very durable (it had to be as i am in construction engineering). when i decided to switch personally to all digital i was very cautious. i first looked for pic quality and durability. from an advanced-amature photographer's point of view this camera is great !!! this camera never leaves my side. it travels with me everywhere i go. it is extremely durable as it is mounted to an ultra-pod ii and i carry it over my shoulder (i don't keep it in a bag). it provides me outstanding quality pohotgraphs (close far or fast: work or play) at a very reasonable price. it takes reasonable video (considering my 35mm took none at all). it is easy to use and learn (even for an old 35mm guy). it is lightweight and power usage is not an issue (nimh is the way to go). i take close to 20000 pics a year for work and play. i am always experimenting with this camera and it's limits. i am so pleased with this camera (and the previous fuji i used) that my next upgrade will be a fuji as well (looking to 10mp). for the $$$ you can't go wrong ",positive
" having been engaged in 35mm photography for 32 years i approached digital photography with great reluctance. i knew there would be an essential learning phase with less than ideal pictures like my playing with a brownie for a few years as a kid -- this further delayed my plunge. finally an upcoming trip overseas compounded with the knowledge of what airport metal detectors do to film forced the issue. my choice was cinched by some pictures we acquired from a friend of papal conclave 2006. we ran them as a screen saver and i was much impressed by the sharpness color tonality and depth of field -- especially in cloudy day pictures of crowds in public squares. faces far into the background were discernable. i asked what was used and it was this camera. at the camera store i was heartened to see it felt like a mini slr in the hand had a nice big viewer and uncomplicated straightforward controls. the learning phase in the backyard and around town gave me some doubts. lack of no-shake feature is the model's biggest downside; a lot got blurred especially using the zoom feature on moving subjects. some of this you learn to shake out using point focus but you still are going to lose a few precious moments despite your best efforts. nor with the limited equivalent asa range are you going to be able to get the sort of pics in museums or dark old cathedrals you are used to with a good slr and high speed film -- but remember this one is a starter. this thing is a monster battery eater too: always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets with you. on the plus side choice of black and white and chrome mode is very nice feature and the built-in zoom has a very decent range and performance on stationary subjects. speed of use may or may not compare well to other digitals i don't know but its a whole world superior to my old world. there is a rather steely patina to even the best color images i see now after viewing hundreds but that's a decent trade-off for the general ease of use and clarity. incidentally the lens on this camera gives you a lot more than what you would expect from a 4 megapixel rating. back from europe this week i have 2000+ jpegs (the keepers) all of very high quality an achievement i could not have come close to i am sure either with old film camera or with most other starter level digitals. the continuing issue of shake and blur i surmounted by simply multiple shooting a lot (sometimes 5-7 images); you can erase them almost as quickly as you shoot them and come to see this as a small nuisance in the bigger trade-off. i do not plan to spend the rest of my life with this level digital camera but even after i move up i think i will keep it around for sheer utilty and ease of use in the general every day world. for the price this is about as good a deal as one can hope for.

" the camera is great because it is small enough to slip into your pocket and take wherever. i have been the main picture taker on our family vacations and get-togethers. we had a 10x optical 5 mp kodak camera that worked well it was just big and bulky never to fit in a pocket. the 10x optical zoom on the v610 also works well the lenses never protrude from the camera when i use the optical zoom. the viewing screen is large and very clear. the menus are very easy to navigate and the on camera editing tools are great. it would also make a fine camera for a beginner. the panorama function works very well also. i have used it multiple times with ease and it created great pictures. the camera turns on quickly and the time between pressing the button and the photo capture is quick. i have had the camera for about a month now and the best thing is the small size without having to compromise in zoom picture quality or functionality. the lcd screen does take up some more battery than other cameras just because it is larger but don't let that stop you from getting the camera. you will be able to take at least 70 or so pictures on a battery and a lot more if you are conservative. my only small frustration was when going skiing i attempted to video my brother coming down the slope using the 10x optical zoom and the image stabilizer. it was at night and only the lights were on the camera wouldn't focus on him until he was close but that may be just because of the low light conditions and glare from the snow. otherwise the video has worked flawlessly. there is even a terrific function that allows you to pause the video at any time during playback and create a picture from that video frame. (very useful) my brother bought the panasonic lumix dmc-tz1k(a very good camera also) before i got the v610 and now he wishes he got the v610 ",positive
" this just arrived thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far. i am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so i won't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls etc. i agree closely with the other two reviews so i won't repeat their details. i'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the hc7 to the sony hc90 an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 mp stills. i have taken about one hour of hd video so far and have viewed it through an hdmi cable on a sony 46 xbr lcd tv (1080p). i captured a few indoor scenes a few neighborhood outdoor scenes and some footage at harper's ferry in west virginia - river mountain and two trains passing by at close range while i was at the railroad station there. i can say comfortably that you won't confuse the video from this camcorder with standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition they aren't kidding. if your tv can show the video off to advantage and you've grown fond of hd i think you'd be pleased with this camcorder. in my case the overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders was to get the hd video so this has made it worth the steep expense. my second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so i only have to carry one piece of equipment around. i already had this in the sony hc90 at 3mp so going up to 6mp was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself. my only output criticisms so far are that the west virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than i remember. i didn't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt. these camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which i have not explored. one or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage and i'm not unhappy with what i think i noticed in the slightest. the stills look very good to me so far but i've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the tv. i normally view stills on a pc. i don't have a telephoto lens yet so i can't report on the quality of the stabilization. i used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video. i was very pleased by the way with how well the camera did with the moving trains. very crisp where i expected a fair bit of motion blur. lcd size and controls have been mentioned in first looks. i'm perfectly happy with a 2.7 lcd instead of the larger one in the ux7. so this wasn't a negative for me personally. the controls (menus) are highly similar to those of the sony hc90 i already have. if you haven't seen them before there's a learning curve. if you have the hc90 or another camcorder with those menus you'll be right at home with the hc7. one note: you can configure p[ersonal]-menus to include the things you use the most in your own order in addition to the camcorder's menus. one thing i forgot is that each mode (video camera play/edit) has its own configurable personal menu. so i was looking for things to add to the play/edit personal menu that i was sure should be configurable but couldn't find them. that was because they belonged only to the filming side not to the playback side. so you've got three personal menus you can create not one. battery: check the sizes on the batteries. the hc90 batteries were very thin. i think three of the batteries for the hc7 fit entirely within its case. the fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that i thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1/2 or so. the other three will fit flush into the back of the camera though they're not behind a door or anything. battery life: my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate but the batteries drain faster than that of the hc90. this is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones. the ccds and the stills and everything are all more than in the hc90. so i think i'm fine with the battery life but you'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery. size compared to the hc90: this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the hc90. it's maybe 1/2 longer front to back and wider as well. i think the hc7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder i see in best buy. but it's noticeably smaller than last year's sr1 sony hard disk camcorder say. i don't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like i did with the hc90 but it's pretty light and still fits in the case i used for the hc90 if i don't load other stuff in there. fit in the hand: i found a best buy with an hc5 and ux5 on hand and played with both at the same time. these have the same footprint as the hc7 and ux7 as far as i can tell. the hc5's tape case is maybe 3/8 wider than the ux5's dvd case. the ux5's dvd case is maybe 1/4 higher. so i found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller ux5 and it felt slightly more comfortable. however i found that the hc5's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb. as i played with this in the store i realized it seemed like the hc5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this. absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you. just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level. tape vs dvd (really hdv vs avchd): i spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year's avchd ux camcorders would still be present and if i would care in any case. the detailed reviews still aren't out so i don't know whether there will be a noise problem there. but i can say i noticed nothing in the footage so far that i'd call noise so my decision to go with the tape and hdv format looks very good to me right now. i have never had the problems people report with mini-dv tapes so that whole transport discussion (tape vs dvd) didn't weigh on me much. the noise discussion did have an effect on my decision though. getting the video to your tv: how much money do we have? apparently. i played the tape back to the tv directly but that's not a long-term solution. i have heard that you can capture the hdv video and then will be able to transform it on a pc to formats suitable for blu-ray or hdv burners if you have the money. then you need a blu-ray or hdv player attached to your tv. for now it sounds like many people are archiving the hdv video to dvds as data files. then they burn playable dvds where the hd is down-converted to standard definition video. so they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce hd versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop. one other hc7 reviewer also implied that hd files captured by ulead software could be moved to a ps3 hard drive and played back to an hd tv from there. so far the easy and cheap path we have for sd video to dvds to tvs is not quite there for hd based on what i've read. the one extra feature i wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20x optical zoom. i'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively so i understand. but that would be #1 on my wish list. overall i am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now. i know we're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago. but it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around take some video and then have play it back on a high-quality hd tv looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment. i know better intellectually but it's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new tvs so beautifully.

" after owning and using the camera for a month or so now i am delighted with it. i have only replaced the batteries one time so don't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for. small lightweight many features. choice of 6 meg 5 4 3 2 and 1 meg photos at fingertips. what i really decided on this camera for was the macro capability as i take photos of very small coins and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that. it preforms magnificantly. my previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle. i love the samsung digimax s600.

" okay i am new to the world of stargazing. i purchased this telescope based on recommendations here at amazon.com. i have been completely satisfied. i am especially impressed with the clear crisp viewing of the moon. i can see a few planets but they are of course very small through the eyepiece. i do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope. take your time putting it together. read all the directions first. pay special attention to the details concerning the collimator. if you don't know what that is you need to. i almsot made some major mistakes screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone. if you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself especially on a clear night. the package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact. i couldn't be happier with my purchase. i am sure a more avid sky-watcher might want a little something more but for the once-in-a-while gazer this is the telescope. see ya next review.

" to my knowlege there simply isn't a better equipped camera for the professional investigator. it's ir-sensitive mode (nightshot) is in b&w (rather than cheeseygreen) far superior quality-wise to anything sony's got and it's the only 3ccd that i know of with a low-light mode. the image stabilization is exceptional and the image quality is production grade. time/date stamps can be burned in so they xfer via firewire - again the only camera i'm aware of with this feature. the audio can be turned off which we know is a must. and best yet you can disable the sleepmode so it won't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting for the camera to cycle back on. it's built like a tank and feels substantial in the hand but it's still lightweight thanks to an alloy frame. finally it's totally silent even with the tape transport in full swing. the only downside so far as i can tell is it's size - it's a big camera compared to the handicams i've had and wouldn't be well suited for close-proximity work. however the black casing dosn't print/siloutte terribly and the 16x optical lets you set back quite a bit. highly recommended!

" i'm by no means an expert but i really wanted a reasonably priced video camera that could produce the highest quality picture for the price. i did a ton of research and landed on the ag-dvc30 after much agonizing over to hd or not hd as well as brands and features. based on all the reviews i read this camera seemed to offer the most features and the best video for the money. i have not been disappointed. on my first outing i took the cam to the grand canyon and sedona. wow! what incredible color and clarity! i also really love the 16x zoom. it's smooth and powerful. i got great shots of the colorado river from the rim of the grand canyon. i'll agree with all reviewers that the audio is not great. it is not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close to the subject. if you're interested in good audio i'd suggest an optional mic. if you just want great video awesome color and ease of use this is your camera. at the price (plus the rebate) you really can't beat it ",positive

" this product is so cool. whatever your situation is if you have a lot of digital pictures then i recommend going out and getting an sd card...preferably up to 1gb (or even 512mb) for use this with this product. even if your camera doesn't use sd you can plop the sd card right into the picture frame and upload photos from your computer to the card! it's like a little computer this frame. another big suggestion i have is to find a program online that resizes your photos to the dimensions of the frame (photo size explained in other reviews). (i downloaded visualizer photo resize). this will take photos down from its original size (e.g. 1.8 mb) to a smaller size (e.g. 500kb). this will let your store dramatically more photos. so far i have fit over 1700 photos in about 430mb worth of the 1gb sd card that i have! the picture quality is very good and the frame can swivel to basically any angle and could be used horizontally or vertically. plus it is a philips which is a great brand. i have a philips hd tv as well and it is my baby...i love it. this is a great present for anyone! how can you go wrong with a picture frame that replaces its picture any time you want ",positive

" i had an olympus stylus 4mp and loved it but wanted a newer model. i purchased this 710 and love it. olympus makes it so easy to take pictures with pre-set options and image stabilization. i love the smaller size of this camera and it was easy to use. there is no way to give it 4 1/2 stars so i gave it 5 but there is one thing i don't like about the area for the usb plug in. you have to pop off this cap (it hangs off the camera) and maneuver the small end of the cable in the camera (tight fit with the cap hanging there) then pop the cap back on..it just seems flimsy and i wonder if that cap will eventually break off. in the 410 it was much easier to access this as it was near the memory card. that is the only design feature i don't care for on the 710. it is a great camera and i am very happy with the purchase.

" an excellent purchase that lives up to the sony name. my main concern before buying it was that it would swivel enough that i could point my mini-camera straight down to take macro photos of documents. it does this easily and the legs don't get in the way. it's small enough to chuck in my backpack and take it all the time in case i need it and it has its own little sturdy fabric carrying bag so that it doesn't get tangled up in anything else. overall i would rate it as excellent ",positive

" go to nikon's own website nikonusa.com and compare the technical specifications of this version and the 'g' version of this lens. there are only three differences. one is that the 'g' version has its aperture set only by the camera body while the 'd' version can have its aperture set either by the body or by a ring on the lens. all recent nikon bodies set the aperture. the ring on the lens is invariably locked on all recent camera bodies. the second difference is that one (1) of the 13 lens elements in the d version of the lens is made of extra low dispersion (ed) glass. if the dispersion difference is so important what is the deal with the other 12 elements? sounds like marketing to me. the third difference is that the 'd' version costs three times as much as the 'g' version ",positive

" this is a great camera for travel and everyday events because of its small and convenient size. we bought it to replace our bulkier sony dsc-f707. the large screen is wonderful! the video feature is a lot of fun but due to the small size it is hard to take a steady video. the battery meter is very useful as it tells you how much time you have left. the main downside with this camera is the flash. it doesn't work well in very dark conditions for distant or even slightly distant shots. if it weren't for the flash i would have given this a rating of 5 stars. this is overall a good camera. for more serious digital photography we prefer to use the sony dsc-f707 as it has a better flash and zoom. however it is too bulky to carry around ",positive
" we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism. naturally only time will tell if this is any different but in the meantime here's what you need to know about this baby: the good: 1) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket. much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i've owned thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere. the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting. 2) big lcd screen - you didn't need me to tell you this right? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying though sometimes it does not appear very clear especially if the subject is not static. however it is bright and rich in color. 3) infolithium - this is sony's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately of course. if use is consistent will provide you with a good idea. if you use one function then another then another it tends to vary much more and is not as useful. 4) integrated charger/usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer. minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger though the bright white color is far from a match. the bad: 1) focusing problems - the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it. i am not speaking about macros but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small near objects such as coins stamps or text. quick focus on objects farther away though. 2) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice. i don't know if the battery is universal but even if it is it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement. 3) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard but this camera uses the memorystick duo which is about 1/4 or so smaller than the regular memorystick. this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards. 4) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark. within a few feet is okay but farther subjects are not touched. 5) 3x optical zoom - c'mon this is 2005! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera. 6) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate. you can certainly take pictures in bursts but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick. previewing the images is also slow. this is also disappointing as it's not faster than my older p52. 7) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod you have to mount the camera on the plastic station then connect the tripod to the plastic dock. this is far from ideal. well there you have it. the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you in which case this could be a great value for you. i am certainly happy with it but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards compatibilities and dubious long-term quality ",positive
" i've owned the t9 now for just about 3 weeks. i purchased it after some extensive research. of course you never really know a product until you've had it awhile. here's my thumb nail opinion. i like: the ultra thin metal body optical image stabilizer great photo quality high iso performance large high rez screen auto focus assist lamp works well very fast start-up fast recovery even after flash lots of built in memory but you need to buy the 1 or 2 gig card ok slide show feature with music i don't like: redeye doesn't work that well too few manual controls needs white balance needs long shutter speed modes chews up battery time pretty fast. already ordered a second battery. no optical viewfinder (most ultra smalls don't) flimsy plastic cover over the battery will be first thing to break all in all a great little camera. takes awesome clear pics. not for the professional photographer but that's not why you are considering it (i hope).

" the panasonic pv-gs500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of panasonic's new 2007 models which will be available in the spring. the pv-gs500 is compact delivers stunning video in moderate lighting and above has a lot of features that will appeal to the aspiring pro-sumer videographer. it lacks an audio output jack which many will fault it for. it does have a separate microphone jack. the menu is driven by a toggle and is easy to use. it is reall aimed at the casual videographer who wants superb quality in a compact uncomplicated package and it delivers precisely that. low-light performance is poor but there is an accessory shoe so you can mount an auxillary light. i would suggest getting an accessory bracket that provides two or three accessory shoes so you can use both a shotgun microphone and an auxillary light for weddings parties and other group events. battery life is about what you would expect so carrying one or two spare batteries is recommended. all in all a very nice 3ccd camcorder for the advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality in an easy-to-use package. jerr ",positive

" i purchased this camera as a replacement for canon optura 20 which was dropped and when estimate for repair exceeded price of this camera i decided to move on. after using dcr-hc28 for several weeks i believe this is a very neat package. overall i am very satisfied with this camera. one of the first things that i noticed is that color representation in low light conditions is much more accurate than that of canon. i grew accustomed to adjusting optura's white balance indoor in order to get accurate color tones. now i am finding that automatic settings work just fine and in fact i didn't have a reason to play with presets as of yet. this camera is more of a point and shoot type than canon. it provides you with manual controls but they are not easily accessible. still i have not found a reason to mess with these. besides for those who would claim that manual settings are necessary for advanced/professional type of filming i would point to the price tag and ask where and when did they last see an advanced/professional camera for under $300? this camera is also about half the size of canon and combined with low price and weight produces a package that i can drag with me while going to the beach bicycling hiking etc and not having to worry about ruining expensive piece of electronic gear as was the case with my optura which at the time when i bought it cost me about 2.5 times of what i paid for sony. so far i've used this camera in about all of the lighting conditions that i would expect to ever having to consider. i have no complaints about its performance. picture seems to be sharply focused and color tones are correct. focus is fast enough to keep up with little kids or to shoot some sports/action. sound quality of the microphone is quiet acceptable. there seems to be very little noise from drive motor and it is not picked up by the mic so it is not transferred to your recording. all of the essential controls and menus are within easy reach. there are few negative points that prevent me from giving this camera 5-star rating. lack of any kind of accessory shoe or external microphone input is a drawback. it would be nice to have these as it would increase range of conditions under which one can use it. still among my friends who actually have a camcorder about 90% don't own an accessory light or external microphone so if it was possible to lower camera cost by omitting these features it is not a criminal move on part of sony. the lcd display could have been a bit larger and it would not hurt if sony would provide it with more freedom of motion - it only swings out to 90 degree angle and in certain situations it is a limiting factor.

" what i love about this case is its softness and its superior quality. it fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it.

" i bought this dock from a seller called miga. they did an excellent job of answering my questions on the product and sending everything in mint condition. i use the dock for my hp r817. having read the reviews regarding the insert i just went through hp's part site and ordered the correct insert for my camera. it was only $5 (before shipping) and it arrived the same day as the dock package. the dock transfers data so much faster then the cradle that comes with the camera plus it has an extra battery which would cost $50 and up by itself from hp. i bought the dock for its dual charging ability for when i go on trips since this dock is less expensive then the fast charge travel kit. i probably won't use the remote control feature or print images right from the dock. but for what i will use it for its an excellent product for the price and i highly recommend it for you 817 818 users out there.

" i originally bought the edit 120 (no detachable case) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often (to leave at home). then i came across the edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly. not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet i was somewhat concerned about the method/design of the atachment. it needed to be easy to remove but it also needed to be secure; the pictures i found on the internet didn't show how it was attached. i was relieved when i actually saw how it was attached. there is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag (an open slot is at each end). the add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro. the attachment method is secure and is almost invisable and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag. i think the original bag is very good and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice. unfortunately you have to buy this as a combination. if you originally bought the 120 single bag version it doesn't have the slotted bottom on it and can't be retrofitted (and i don't think they sell the detachable bag separately) ",positive

" yep we love this camera! amazon got it to us just in time for our trip to las vegas and we got wonderful footage and great still shots of our trip. the still shots are amazing you can really zoom in close and get great clear shots of things our regular digital camera couldn't. in fact we tested this and have proof as we had both cameras with us. my son got a great close up of star jones from far across the gathered crowd right up to her face as if he were standing right in front of her and my photo from the same area is so pixilated and blurry you can't even tell what the subject was! i love that we have two cameras in one video and stills so we don't have to carry both. i really like that there is a separate card for the still photos so low battery power doesn't threaten to wipe the memory clean. we eventually got a longer life battery but the one hour did just fine on our trip. it would be nice to have a separate battery charger but it really didn't get inconvenient we'd just plug it in while we slept and we were ready for the day when we woke up. and the price was excellent for all the features we got. yep we love this camera ",positive

" i have been using the fuji e550 for almnost two years with none of the problems that have been reported by some of the reviewers. here are the negatives: 1) the flash has mediocre range and is a little finicky. if you don't depress the shooting button all the way it may not flash. 2) in bright light the screen on the back is unusable - it washes out the image. but the camera has a fine viewfinder so this is not really a major issue. the positives: 1) it takes great pictures. really excellent. 2) it's small and easy to carry. 3) the controls are well thought out and positioned on the camera body. very easy to use. 4) it has several automatic modes - sports landscapes portrait etc or you can use it on manual. i always use one of the programmed modes. 5) the video option is not bad at all - my twelve year old (now 13) uses it. i was so pleased with this camera i bought one for my administrative assistant about ten months ago and she is very happy with it. at it's current price i think this camera is a bargain. only reason i didn't give it five stars is because of the weak flash.

" i bought this one as a cheap extra battery. i have seen no differences in performance so far and would therefore recommend this as a great extra or replacement battery ",positive
" i was amazed on how well this battery has performed. i did make sure when i got it i did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since. i can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder (sony hdr-hc1). it is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but i use the lcd when shooting anyway and almost always on tripod ",positive
" i have the sony battery that came with the camera and bought an additional sony battery that allowed for 2-4 hours. however i wanted a battery that i could count on for the better part of an all day event and i found it in the qm91d. i was asked to photograph a wedding from getting ready (hair dresser at 0830 until the end of the reception at 11:30pm) the qm91d held strong. i did not constantly video tape but with my digital recorder i had 6 sony 120 tapes (60 min digital) -- 5 were captured using the qm91d. i did switch some of the tapes before they were completely used to make sure i didn't miss important events ... so i never actually used up all of the qm91d battery. this battery was used again during the evacuation from houston (secondary to hurricane rita) -- i used it entirely and it did not faulter ... it lasted throughout the trip and i had no need to change to the smaller batteries. the size of the battery did not really bother me -- i was aware that it would be larger than the others and it did not hamper the use of the camera. read the manufacturer information on battery life charging time etc ... for this battery it is valid. i would recommend this battery.

" i bought this item to be used with my sony hdr-hc3 camcorder in combination the fig rig. it works as advertised. i do wish the clamp portion of the item was removeable but it can be worked around. i found the remote to be very responsive as you would expect from sony. and the price was a bargin.

" i purchased this kit primarily for the extra battery which retails for about what i paid for this item. having the backup battery is great but i was pleasantly suprised by the soft case. it protects my dsc-p200 without being bulky or heavy. with the camera being so small it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money. the case for the memory sticks is nice as well. it is easy to lose a stick if it's just floating around and the case keeps them securely. all in all this is an excellent value ",positive
" the camera is good. had it 1 week now. low light it works and produces fair results. bright light is much better. small and light weight. you must use the supplied docking station to transfer as ther is no usb port on camera . there is the dc in and tv out on camera (as well as the docking station...just no usb...why? ) 30gb hard drive is plenty...maybe too much. if you fill this up you are looking at 8 dvd's and hours of transfer. the software is weak and conflicts with roxio 7.5. roxio became unusable. roxio stinks anyway. found a simple program to burn after this...ashampoo. plan on getting adobe premier elements too. amazon had the best deal...89 less 30 mail in rebate from adobe. much better then the software in box. my first cam as we now have a cute baby. easy to keep it rolling and have gigs to save.

" out of the box this is a simple to use camera. the convenience of having the video or picture right on a hard drive is great. i did a lot of searching and this one was the most bang for the buck. just starting to use it so can't say much for now. my wife loved it for its size and weight ",positive

" i have just purchased my second m407 camera yes that's right i said the second one. i purchased the first about a year ago and have used it in the wilds of idaho taking pictures in all kinds of weather at every elevation imaginable. all the pictures have turned out great. i recently had a reason to take more pictures indoors new grand daughter. again the pictures have been fantastic have had several blown to 11x17 for matting and framing great quality. i would make several suggestion to folks buy digital camera batteries every camera i have owned eats batteries this hp is no different. if you spend the money and get good quality batteries they will last! second recommendation get a sd memory card if you are like me you will not be happy with the interanl memory and want to take lots of pictures. so this photographer says you can't beat the price for the quality and service you get from hp. i forgot to mention i had a camera that didn't work and hp replaced within 2 days with a new one no questions asked. good service goes a long way in my book. buy one you won't be sorry!

" after reading dozens of reviews for both this case and the psc-55 i was still undecided on a case for my canon sd630. so i purchased both to see for myself which one would work. because red is my favorite color i really wanted the red case to fit (psc-90). the camera will fit in the case but it's a very tight fit. i had to shove the camera in the case to make the snap close. the psc-55 is still a very snug fit but allows for some extra breathing room which i feel is better for the safety of the camera. in addition here's something to consider if you're deciding between the two cases: the inside lining of the psc-90 is more of a rigid nylon material while the lining of the psc-55 is a softer felt material. the case overall is still rigid but i like the thought of my camera resting against a softer lining. based on that alone i'm going with the psc-55 - i feel that this will be more friendly to the 3 screen on the sd630. both cases are a very nice leather and are very attractive - i'm pleased with the canon brand ",positive
" when it comes to buying camcorders i personally like the one with the build in memory. but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind. unlike other sony camcorders first of all it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot. its a good use of your money. you can have it for under $400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there. easy to use touch screen takes still photos has a good speaker so it's easier to record video and voice fits into your palm so to speak and if you use rewritable mini dvds you wouldn't have to worry about go out of memory. so when it comes to sony camcorders i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly.

" sony continues to exhibit the highest quality in their product design and manufacturing process. this case is very slim compact well made and has a very luxurious feel to it. it completely enhances the look and attractiveness of the sony camera it is designed to hold ",positive

" very clear pictures very happy with this camera. note that it has only the lcd screen and no viewfinder but this hasn't been a problem for me as it's pretty easy to use ",positive
" this is my first digital camera. prior to this i had a simple kodak point-and-click model which pretty much the quality of a disposible. i use much higher grade cameras at work both 35mm and digital. this camera gives you the 5.1 mp ability though most shots only require the 3mp. i like the 32mb internal memory though i've also bought a 256mb card for traveling. the 5x zoom isn't as cool as i initially thought it would be and digital zoom works sometimes and not others but you must understand what digital zoom really is. the camera takes very clear and optimal pictures. better pictures then i've taken on anything else i've owned before (and some of the work cameras as well). the size is small enough to put in your pocket but not too small for one with larger hands. the different flash options and shooting scenes can turn difficult pictures into what you want to capture. the panoramic shot sequence is an especially favorite feature especially for shoreline shots. i've also bought the r-series dock and enjoy its ability to transfer my pictures faster and charge two batteries at once. this camera is worth the price you pay but i believe its a 2005 model so it may not be the most up to date but it does a great job.

" i had been searching web site after web site for a system like this. i finally found a site where i could purchase seperate parts for a comparable system. however the receivers alone were more than this unit( if you wanted a receiver compatible with a plasma). this works great. could not be easier to install. all components are in my basement. i ran the eye through the wall and have the eye barely exposed through a single cable face plate with the blue led light taped to the back of the plate. the blue light still shines through the faceplate which is perfect. the faceplate is just below my wall mounted plasma set. no interference. this set up allows me to use this system at just about any angle in the room and the adjacent kitchen. works great with a basic $20 all in one ir remote. also the customer service is like no other. i had several questions and each e-mail was answered by the next day with great help. made this purchase a no brainer. this is one product that far exceeded my expectations even after reading all the great reviews. i highly recomend this product.

" the gs150's performance is as-advertised. terrific colour rendering thanks to its 3-chip configuration. the camera also has the option of full manual control of standard settings making it even more usable. love the joystick! still find it hard to believe that panasonic has managed to fit all of this performance into such a small package. final score: engineering 1 customer service 0 early production runs of this camera seem to have a shielding problem which causes faint red horizontal bands to appear when recording in very low light conditions. despite the fact this has been widely (if unofficially) reported by gs150 owners around the world these same owners have noted that panasonic customer service generally denies that the problem exists. thankfully the problem is easily repaired by a certified technician. better still gs150 owners seem to have collectively deciphered that units manufactured from september 2005 onward are alright. look for cameras with serial numbers beginning with 'h5' or higher. you can also read all about this at pana3ccduser dot com ",positive
" i had to decide between this camera and a panasonic. we trust the sony brand a little more so we went with the sony. we were looking for an easy-to-use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter...nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later. i also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we wouldn't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations. here's what i think so far: great camcorder to do exactly what we want -- picture looks great inside and out very easy to use and small enough to carry along almost anywhere. still photos are not fantastic (only 3mp) but good enough for me. color and resolution are acceptable. not easy to understand the lcd touch menus but you can configure the buttons once you figure out which buttons you will use the most. i got the bare minimums for accessories...bought a 1gb memory card (memory stick duo pro)...glad i did this since i will be taking stills and short video clips to email to the grandparents. also got a carrying case dv tapes and an extra np-fp71 battery. i'll be purchasing a firewire cable soon (i'm sure you've heard the usb cable is inadequate for downloading video). handycam station doesn't really bother me that much but i can see what the fuss is about. all things considered i'm extremely happy with my purchase. i think this is a perfect camera for a first-time camcorder buyer who needs an easy button (there's one on the side of the camera). a little more expensive than some of the others but the price is dropping. best of luck!

" i've owned the p-73 for about two years now. one thing i'm noticing about a couple digital cameras in the amazon reviews is that after a year or so the camera has some kind of error or just dies completely. for me this hasn't happened with this camera. it's always been great and it has a lot of really convenient features. when i bought this camera i knew nothing about cameras. i just wanted one really bad for some reason one day and went out and bought this one because it was pretty. i got really lucky--i mean i only bought it because it was pretty--i knew nothing about it. but nonetheless i got lucky and bought this camera that takes aa batteries came with a battery charger and its own usb cord. it had a ton of settings on it. now that i understand more about photography i really like the manual setting--the slowest shutter speed is 30 seconds compared to 10-15 seconds of even newer cameras in its class. like i said i never had any problems with it. batteries always lasted long; took little time to recharge. i never even bought a memory card for this camera--i use the lowest resolution to take pictures because that's all the given memory card can hold and my pictures are still decent quality. i'm now looking into a new camera because i do want excellent image quality and ironically ever since i've been shopping for a new digital camera my sony has been overexposing and underexposing about 20 percent of the shots i take; weird. anyway if you're looking to buy a sony digital camera based on my experience with this one i'd recommend the brand ",positive

" through most of the 1990s i lived overseas in both europe and asia. unfortunately my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as i hated looking like a tourist with my bulky camera! nowadays i no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one! i intially bought this t7 after using a friend's t1 and being impressed with the size of it. the t7 is obviously considerably smaller which is even better! i bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $400 for it plus a 1gb memory stick pro. both are investments that even to this day (over a year later) i am very happy with. i have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever i go people love to look at it. i can say i've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes. as far as size that is the biggest plus to it's advantage. it can fit anywhere. even with the optional case that you can buy for it it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket without even a noticable bulge. as far as photo quality goes as most of the reviews note the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots. i've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you'll get but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash what can you expect? after shooting a few thousand photos with this camera i know what will be a good and bad night shot and with the playback feature you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed. is it perfect? no but that's super tough in a camera this small. some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still. i've never had issue with this but i could see how it could be an issue it's just never one either my wife (the primary user) or i have dealt with. i would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem. i've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger (and more expensive) point-and-shoot digital cameras. i have been very pleased with that. another drawback noted by many reviews is the lcd screen and the chance of breaking it. i put a plastic screen protector (the thin plastic sheet type held by static) on it as soon as i bought it and haven't had a problem. i've sat on the camera before (by accident of course!) and have had it in luggage and the like but have never had a problem. the most significant drawback that i've had with the camera is that it can take more photos (esp with the 1gb card) than the battery will last. buy a second battery and you'll be more than good but it's just something to keep in mind. i would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos. it can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots it's all that you need. i can say that we have many photos of our kids (and really good ones too) that we would never had gotten if my wife didn't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag! i'm happy enough with it that i'm going to buy a second one for myself (especially now that the prices have dropped so much!) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography. i give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others ",positive
" solidly built this tripod balances well even when used with the heavier sony cybershots like the dsc-r1. the remote shuttle release button helps to further reduce camera shake which is priceless when taking photos in conditions where camera shake is amplified (high optical zoom supressed flash etc). what surprises me is the fact that the shuttle release button on the remote works exactly the same as any sony cybershot : press halfway to focus and all the way down to capture the shot. the zooming buttons do not work for the sony dsc-r1 as the camera has a manual zooming ring but they should work fine with any other cybershot that comes with an electronic zoom and of course an acc terminal. highly recommended.

" there some very detailed reviews most of which i read before i ordered the camera from amazon. there is ample evidence that professionals will find the camera useful. i want to take a minute to speak for the rest of us. the camera came a month ago and i've extremely happy with it. let me offer some perspective on my comments. the last camera i bought was a small sony shirt-pocket-sized camera that i was using alot and it got me back into taking pictures. i decided that since i was taking so many pictures i wanted a camera that would take much better quality shots without my having to get a phd in picture-taking. i opted for this camera with the 18-200mm lens. i now take the same pictures i took with the small camera but with the zoom lens i can frame them better and with the 10.2 mega pixels i can blow them up and frame them. there are dozens (hundreds?) of features that i will grow into but for now i am delighted to use this camera right out of the box with just minimal reading of instructions. everything i remember from my 35mm days (my first camera was a minolta srt-101 that i bought in 1973) can be put to use but what i forget the camera remembers. my point--this is a camera that is ready to meet you wherever you are and grow with you should you decide you want to go farther out and deeper in ",positive
" 5 stars...easy to use. the screen is large and clear. the automatic settings include a variety of scene selections (ie beach party fireworks scenes). i have yet to use the video so i cannot comment on that. i think this is a great all-around camera and it fits in the smallest purses...big plus. the screen has yet to get scratched in all my purse juggling. my only complaint would be in the shipping. i paid extra to expedite my order since i was leaving the country a few days later. it was sent via ups with a signature in person required. when i missed ups the first time i was unable to just sign the paper and leave it on my door. i had to contact ups to find out when they would return so i could sign in person which was an ordeal. i wish i would've known that the camera was being sent this way. i would've requested that no signature be required.

" for less than $200 this is a great camera. it is by no means spectacular but for the price it does a good job. i own a canon powershot s60 as well and the canon outdoes this camera in some ways but it's not pocketable. the f20 is easy to use the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly and shutter lag seems average (close to the s60). however the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a dslr. the anti-shake mechanism is not really useful at all it merely boosts the iso to 2000 which makes the image unprintable (at least indoors). i have yet to try it this feature outside. i've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights especially outdoors. manually setting the iso from 100-400 will i hope make for more printable usable pictures. i had actually thought of returning this little camera but then realized that i could find nothing for the price that would be able to compete. i really wanted a 28mm lens only found on more expensive models like the canon sd800is or lumix's (which apparently have tons of noise at low iso's). it's pocketable portable and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it.

" i bought this camera as something a bit more capable but not as expensive as an slr. with a zoom equivalent to a 300 mm lens on an slr i certainly saved myself a heap of money over buying an slr setup with the same capacities. i use this camera mostly in manual. that was my aim in buying it - to get more proficient in using the manual settings. a few times i have switched it to auto and haven't been all that impressed. the autofocus seems a little unpredictable but there is a single press manual focus button on the left side as well as a focusing ring and these do me very well indeed. i don't think i would recommend this camera to someone who wanted to use it mostly as a point and shoot. it loses one star mostly because of its poor macro capability. for really really good closeups it just doesn't come close to my konica minolta dimage z6. i was a bit lost without image stabilization at first. this camera compensates for not having this by jacking up the film speed when in auto and if i want to use it in manual and handhold of course i have to do the same. since i use a tripod a lot this is not too much of an issue for me. i've heard a lot of bad press on the graininess at higher iso but i have found them to be at least as good as film if not better. the colors are great. i love my range of menu options though there is nothing too extraordinary about them. this camera has more buttons than some but once i got used to them they make my selections so much faster when i am shooting in changing light conditions. i like the fact i can use a cable release with this camera. i have used it for quite a bit of low light work and the fact that i can dial it right down to a twenty second shutter speed or even to b is fantastic. i've found it pretty hard to find image editing software to work directly with raw images from this camera. it's working really well for me as a prosumer camera. however i still think that if i could go back i might go for a panasonic dmc-fz50 10.1mp instead. maybe. i would have to check that one out more thorougly first ",positive
" well i don't even know where to start for this camera. but about a year ago when this camera first got launched to the digital camera market it costed nearly twice as much as what you can pay for it now. for the price this camera has alot to offer. i just love the color tone of fujifilm. you get a very studio-like effect with fujifilm ccd technology. this camera has many manual controls and features that will interest both professional and amature photographers. the 9 megapixel can really be helpful when it comes to cropping. the pictures taken by this camera is bright and clear. the camera picture can be noisy if you set the iso above 400. so for the best result just set the iso level as low as possible (lets say iso 80?). the 10.7x zoom lens is very convenient when you want to get close to the subject you are shooting. i used this camera for every occasion and it never failed me. i heard alot of complaints about the poor battery life of this camera but just buy nimh battery that is about 2500 mah and above and you should get about 200-250 shots. make sure to buy at least a 2 gb memory card because the picture files are pretty big especially in raw format. also for the price this camera feels very solid in the hand. it feels very professional and sturdy (made in japan). the buttons are nicely placed and very easy to use. make sure to buy an external flash if you want to do some serious light photography. i recommnend the sunpak 383 non-dedicatted flash to go with this camera. it works together really well. anyway for $407 you cannot get a better camera than this one. thank you amazon for making this good deal possible. again i highly recommend this camera.

" this is a very good camcorder with the main problem i noted being the dvd format giving only 30 minutes or so of recording in hd mode per disk. it is also a problem that only blue-ray dvd players can play back the dvd in hd mode. even worse that it might destroy the disk if you use it on another player. nevertheless the price was good and i think blue-ray will be more affordable in the near future. meanwhile i can playback my video directly or send it to the computer. i am glad i bought it. if a minidv tape version were available at the same price now i think it might be better to stick with the tape version for now though. i was sent a bad power supply with the camcorder but sony sent a new one right away. be careful to buy the correct battery and external charger accessories for the camera as it is a bit confusing as to which will work for it. overall - i am very happy with the camcorder ",positive

" i mainly use the camcorder for recording my kids. i bought this camcorder a couple of weeks ago. i had the sony hc-7 before for a couple of weeks which i returned to buy the canon camcorder. the high light performance of both camcorders are excellent. with the sony camcorder i felt that the best color performance can be achieved by reducing the color intensity. the low light performance when recording 1080i is similar for the two camcorders but much better with canon when recording in 24p format. this is the main reason that i prefer the canon. the 24p recording is more sensitive to motion which can be a problem if recording motion. the still images from canon are lower resolution but to me they looked better than sony. this is especially true when taking flash pictures. the sony seems a little better built. the hdmi cover on canon is poorly built. i liked the controls on canon better than sony. the auto focus and automatic white balance worked better in canon than in sony. the auto white balance in sony worked poorly in indoor light. sony has supershot infrared recording and canon does not. sony has more manual controls than canon.

" you can't beat the hd picture quality from the hv20 based on actual user reviews and comparisons with all of the latest models. while this is a single cmos sensor it is a true 1920 x 1080 hd sensor of the same quality found in the award winning canon digital slr cameras. don't be fooled by a 3ccd camcorder that uses smaller sensor sizes and must use pixel shifting. i had already hooked up the hv20 to my 720p projector and it did look great even at my typical 120. but i do know that my projector probably isn't calibrated very well to be honest. so my first wow moment came when i decided to capture some of my best outdoor footage from my canon elura stock and compare it to some hv20 footage shot of my kids over the weekend at an easter egg hunt. wow the difference in quality was even more pronounced than i realized. i guess that the resolution difference is what it is but this is definitely serious hd quality. the real defining wow moment that has me selling all of my family and friends on this camcorder came last night when i hooked it up at my brother-in-law's house to his sony wega crt hdtv display that does 1080i and is calibrated to perfection. you won't find a higher quality hd display than his set imo and my jaw dropped when my video first came up on his display that was the first time when i was truly able to see what my source footage was capable of in terms of its full resolution and amazing colors. we switched to discovery hd on his set and other than obvious production value aspects you honestly couldn't really say that it looked any more hd than the footage of my kids playing. this is way more exciting to me than when i first saw broadcast hd and watched monday night football because it is hard to describe how cool it is to see your kids on video in beautiful hd for a $1000 price point. i can hardly wait to get out there and shoot some more footage.

" this review is for the coolpix 5900 with 5mp. you will not be displeased with this camera if you are in the market for a compact digital camera. this little baby lies comfortably in your pocket until you want it and rarely fails to deliver no matter what lighting obstacles you throw in it's path. the footprint is amazingly small for a 5mp and you'll be amazed at the functionality. i found the video/movie feature to be a real useful tool that surprises most people with the great clarity and utterly blown-away at night shots in poor light. think of las vegas lights on the strip or a crowd of people in thin night light. this camera handled it all. the sd card is easy to access and i recommend a 1gb size so you can take your time with movies. otherwise a 512mb card will give you about 300 photos. but i warn you you will be bitten by the movie bug and want to use this more and more (provided you have disk space or burn the excess to dvds). i also recommend the san disk ultra ii sd cards for fast recovery speeds so you don't have to wait for each shot to record before going to the next shot (this is 5 mp and that's a lot of pixals to store). the roll on the side of the body enables you to keep a tight grip on it with one hand shots- a feature many small cameras lacked. the battery life is exceptional but as always buy a backup for travel. the hit of one star was for the frustratingly small on/off button. i know they designed it so that it won't accidentally turn on in your pocket but my fat finger is not the best tool.... the 2 inch lcd is not protected like others too but so far seems pretty tough rolling around in my pocket with sunglasses and other things that so far have not scratched it.

" i have a canon eos rebel which takes fantastic pictures. i use it around home and when i am setting up static shots such as family portraits. the only problem is...who wants to lug it around to take snapshots. despite some of the above opinions about lack of sharpness i have had no such problems. the 5900 is great for grab shots and it's not too shabby for setting up a planned shot using it's advanced controls. be sure that you buy a fast memory card. this will reduce the time between shots. as in most cameras a memory card is not supplied with the camera. mr. goyal's review about not being able to take pictures without a memory card is not true. you can take a limited number of shots with the internal memeory. the only real problem i have is the red-eye reduction feature. i usually turn it off as the delay between the red-eye flash and the main flash is too long. the subjects often think the shot is over and start to move. anyway it is easy enough to remove it later either with photo-software or with the photo kisok in the drug store ",positive
" got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well! more than 3000 great pictures have been taken. the camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance. a word of caution - ensure that the camera doesn't get pressurized laterally - this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it. the spring-operated shutter is very sensitive. would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost-effective and easy-to-use film camera ",positive

" do not expect this to replace the zoom from your camera. it will not do that nor was it intended to do so. what it does do is optically bring things a little bit closer. this is certainly preferably to using the digital zoom that comes with so many cameras. the lens works by screwing into the end of the camera lens where filters would normally be put. this means that it is something which must be planned for to be used. it is not to be put on while filming is taking place; it is in place when filming begins. since it is easy to use this should not take too long. the normal zoom of the camera can be used while this lens is in place. having it in place just changes the limits from a little bit closer to what would normally be the case to not quite as far when the camera is zoomed out to maximum. care should be taken not to get this lens cross threaded when putting it in place. the quality of the optics seem to be fine. i used it on a sony dcr-vx2100 and had no problems. this is a handy gadget to have handy in your case but be aware of what it will and will not do.

" this is a very flexible and capable camera. if you are looking for more than a point & shoot will offer there are very few that would compare. for me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing. the 16:9 is an ok feature if you plan on hdtv veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to 4:3. i would prefer a larger screen and lose the 16:9 feature. the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside i am very satisfied ",positive
" at least for now it is :-) . during the course of the past 10-12 months i have owned 7 that's seven digital cameras: canon s230; kodak v530; 5 different models of casio's: z60 z600 z850 p700; and most recently presented my wife with a red s770 for valentine's day. i also had a pretty good chance to evaluate canon sd450 (my brother-in-law owns one - it was actually a gift from my wife and i to him for his 21st birthday) casio ex-s600 (a good friend of mine owns one) and panasonic dmc-tz1 (once again a gift from my wife and i to my father-in-law for his last birthday). if you read any of my digital camera reviews (and i've written a few by now) then you know that i'm not particularly fond of canon's lately - i think they are overrated and overpriced for what they have to offer. as i also mentioned before i've tried several different kodak models (and i used to work for the company too!) but all of them turned out to be a waste of my time to say the least. i became a big fan of casio's although not all of my experiences with them were great. but being a huge gadget freak that i am and constantly wanting new toys i have always craved for more. over time my tastes in digital cameras have changed from having a simple point and shoot type of camera to wishing for more power and manual control. so one by one i returned/sold all of my cameras and after extensive (and i really do mean extensive) research i got myself an lx2. i must say though that i probably wouldn't have without getting to know my father-in-law's tz1 first. i was actually quite impressed with it. powerful zoom sharp lens decent picture quality. i also played with some other panasonic models in various stores just to get a better feel for them as well as spent a few hours on the phone and exchanged numerous e-mails with a friend of mine who owns an fz30 and who swears by it. unfortunately lx2 was not available anywhere locally but i felt that i got a pretty good understanding of what panasonic's cameras are all about and after some more thought and consideration i went ahead and bought it from amazon (nice thing about buying from amazon is that you can always return whatever it is you bought including digital cameras within 30 days for a full refund no questions asked). i did know about the noise issue at high iso's but it wasn't a decisive factor for me and i'm glad i didn't pay much attention to it and got the camera anyway. it turned out to be one of the best purchases i've made in a long while. here is why: pros: - superb design. this camera is wonderfully crafted. and i absolutely love black! it gives the camera a nice clean professional look. i don't think i'll be buying another silver camera soon after having this one; - intuitive controls and menus. i charged the battery put it into the camera and started using it and taking pictures right away without even going through the manual once; - a load of features including a large bright widescreen lcd; wide angle super sharp leica lens with a 4x zoom; mega ois - optical image stabilization control (optical means it's done mechanically which is a true way of doing stabilizing comparing to other cameras where it's done by tricking the camera into using higher iso's); and many more. in addition it has a joystick for an easy access to different menus has a number of manual controls as well as provides ability to shoot in raw format (more on that later); - it comes with silkypix developer studio software for working with camera raw files. for someone who is not familiar with raw - it's a pure camera specific picture format. it varies upon a manufacturer meaning that canon raw is different from nikon or panasonic raw for example. and it's pure in a sense that it's of a much better quality than a standard jpeg (jpg) and doesn't suffer from loss of information such as white balance or brightness. there is a lot more to raw than that and i'm not going to go into details right now. what i want to say however is that having previously owned a camera which supported raw format (casio ex-p700) i must have tried about a dozen of different raw editing software packages including products from adobe ulead arcsoft photofiltre picture window pro acdsee lightzone image broadway and more. silkypix delivered by far the best results of all. the only one that i would probably put next to it is bibble; - noise - what noise?! i really hate it when i hear people complaining about noise in this camera (after having it tried myself) or any other compact digital camera for that matter. are you really that nave that you think that you will get absolutely no noise in your images using a compact digital camera? think again. you might have noticed that i've used the word compact several times here. i've done it on purpose - it is inevitable for a compact digital camera to produce some noise. some cameras are better than others but no matter how hard you try you will see some. this camera is no better or worse than any other one that i've had/tried. at higher iso's (above 400) it's slightly more visible but who in the right state of mind is using anything over iso 200 on a compact digital camera such as this one anyway? i always have mine set to a 100. if i feel that it doesn't get the job done i shoot in raw; - picture quality is very good. yes it does take some time getting used to but once you familiarize yourself with everything this camera is capable of you can achieve spectacular results especially if you don't mind doing some post processing. as much as i like everything this camera has to offer there are however some things that kind of irritate me. here is a short list of bad things about this camera otherwise known as cons: - first of all this camera has actually been somewhat misrepresented. it's been advertised as a 10.2 megapixel camera which is not entirely true. 10.2 mp resolution is available only in 16:9 (wide) aspect ratio. two more ratios are available - 3:2 and a more conventional 4:3 but those offer 8.5 and 7.5 mp resolutions respectively. so if you compare this camera to others that don't have a widescreen format or if you prefer to shoot only in a regular 4:3 mode then this camera should only be referred to as a 7 mp digital camera (because not all the pixels are actually effective). obviously panasonic is aware of it and marketed it having higher pixel count on purpose to boost consumer's interest; - i expected to see a compact digital camera. what i got instead was actually a smaller compact camera than i expected. i was really surprised to see how small yet convenient to hold and operate the camera body was. what i didn't like however was the lens. not the lens itself it's actually quite superb but the fact that it sticks out. i like cameras with lenses that retract all the way back to the camera body. i realize that it would probably loose some features like the wide angle and perhaps zoom but i still wish it did that. it would be so much more... umm... compact?! the way it actually is makes it quite difficult to find the right case for it. almost impossible i should say. i've tried a few but they are either too small or too big. i just can't find one that would fit right. i put an order for an slx1b case for it which is specifically designed to fit lx1 and lx2 models but i hear they are not that good. we shall see; - i'm not a big fan of a pop-up flash. i always keep forgetting to open it when i need to use it. and it also seems a bit flimsy. i'm treating it as carefully as i can but i just can't stop thinking that it might break soon; - i hate the lens cap!!! there i said it. it's probably just one of those small annoyances that keep frustrating you until you get used to it but for now i'm not really happy with it. summary: despite very few minor negatives i think lx2 is probably one of the best most innovative cameras on the market today and i sure am glad to have one. it offers more than any other camera in the same price range and can even compete with some dslr's when it comes to picture quality. if you are someone like me who wants to have more control and/or learn more about digital photography or a dslr user who just needs a solid backup to carry everywhere then this camera is not be overlooked! highly recommended ",positive

" i bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back. i am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors. after hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here's the lowdown... pros ... picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10x (i never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures although this camera isn't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom). prints that i've made up to 16x20 (haven't gone larger but i know i can) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6. it is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick. the stabilization at full 10x zoom is incredible also. it appears really shaky through the window but pictures continue to turn out crisp. close-ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details. the movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion (read cons). cons ... indoor shooting is limited because the flash isn't strong enough. when at a school chorus concert the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear. award ceremonies the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards. the zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie. this camera seems to eat batteries especially in the winter months. i am always on the go and when i go to pull out the camera i find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again. it comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so i must always have lens cleaner wipes on me. the viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere but that also is minor. most of the cons really are all minor things that don't interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues. i tried to be as precise about this camera as possible. all in all i would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer. if you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities just keep in mind for the flash to work good keep your subjects close. it's been bumped jostled and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem ",positive

" i stumbled across this little gem by accident. i was picking up supplies at office depot and they had a kodak z650 (display model) on sale for under $100. it was a ridiculous impulse buy--i already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing i needed was another camera! but what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be! it's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old olympus c-740. i had never seriously looked at kodak cameras ... i always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are serious photographers. but i couldn't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need i wanted to fill -- a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots i was used to with my c-740. there are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots. i've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it--something i've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras including the c-740. some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp. it handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that i've tried. at less than a third of the price of my canon s2-is this little camera outclasses the others by a mile. i stumbled on to a good find in the z650 ... it's not going to give you dlsr quality photos but no point-and-shoot will. this camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots. i just wish someone would have given a good report on kodak cameras before i spent a small fortune on the others ",positive

" i was looking to expand my lens collection without breaking my budget and found this 50mm to be an excellent first choice. i love being able to shoot in low light situations which this lens has allowed for me to do. however the auto-focus leave a lot to be desired as far as speed and accuracy goes. i've found leaving it in manual focus allows me to get more shots faster at least in low light.

" i would recommend this to anyone looking for a way to take video and pictures without the hassle of lugging around (and charging) two separate gadgets. it takes excellent pictures just as good if not better than any other digital camera i have seen. i am also very pleased with the video - i found the software very user friendly and video was easy to transfer and edit on my computer. the battery has a good life i have had no problems having to stop and recharge it. there is a nite mode that compensates (very well i think) for low light video. the camera is easy to carry around (it is smaller than my 35mm) and i am having no problems with the functionality - all in all a great idea and easy to use with great pictures and great video ",positive

" i have no complaints. i have had this camera for over a year and a half and it has been reliable fast and gives me crisp quality photos! the only option i wish this camera had was a better stabilization mode to prevent blurred pictures but the software edits the blur without reducing the quality. blurry pictures are not a problem as long as you know how to aim and shoot. everyone loves playing with my camera because it has many cool features to make your photos fun! i highly recommend this camera (especially to beginners or for those who just want a simple camera that can capture those precious moments with high quality photos). excellent camera overall! ; ",positive
" the beauty of this charger is that it is 110/220v compatable so with the appropriate international connector you can charge your batteries on european voltage. i have used two of these with the plug adapters and have kept four sets of batteries charged overnight for two olympus cameras giving a day plus of batteries available for each. very few cheap us chargers offer this multi voltage compatability. lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors. if you plan on traveling internationally this charger is a must!

" this is a must have item for your kodak dig. camera. it allows for filters tele/wide aux lenses or any 55mm screw on attachment. apart from that the black metal enclosure compleatly covers the entire lens assemby at any zoom or focal length. this adds a very strong and valuable protection to your lens. if you accidentally bang the camera against a hard surface this adapter may very likely save your lens (camera) from destruction. i always keep it on with a skylight filter the skylight or a uv filter further protects the lens from impact scratches and dust. if used when the lens is not fully extended ex: wide angle to normal zoom the adpter also helps block out stray light and acts as a light shade. kodak aught to have this built into their camera as a permanent fixture but alas they make extra revenue on their accessories. do buy it!

" seems panasonic has finally dropped the hammer on the pseudo dslr market with 420mm at 12x or 749mm - 21.4x at 3mp is outstanding especially with ois. excellent pictures out of the box menu operations are plentiful nr can be reduced and the jog dials front and back for aperture or shutter is very professional. leica lens is crisp and sharp i shoot in aperture priority with nr at minimal and the pictures even in jpeg look like they have been post processed simply amazing. after experiencing this camera i sold my nikon d80 attachment lens and soft pictures nikon was giving me is unacceptable i went thru every menu option including using the much hyped rgb3 which by the way gives cartoon colors has no comparison to the panasonic. high speed usb is my only complaint for data transfers noise reduction for higher iso noise is a bit over powering but acceptable but controllable at your liking a 3 screen would be nice but maybe on the next model. btw moon shots with the raynox 2020 at 3mp give a zoom of 47.08x optical or 1647 mm optical hand held shots with ois (image stabilization) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures you actually have a telescope with ois at your reach simply amazing. 100% satisfied.

" this is my third digital camera and by far my favorite. i purchased after having a very versatile but large (well large in the dimensions of digital cameras) digital camera. i needed and wanted a camera that i could easily carry w/ me at all times. this is perfect. the fugi z1 fits easily into your pocket or a small case for easy access. just don't put anything else in that pocket! the one time i forget and did this i noticed a large scratch on the silver portion of the camera. as with all digital cameras this one takes much better pictures in good lighting. i have found however that this tiny camera has an excellent flash so i am still able to get good interior shots if i am willing to blind people (or my cats) for a few seconds. the camera comes w/ a docking station that i have found very useless for uploading pictures but you have to use it to charge the camera. i tend to just use a usb cable direct to the computer or a really cheap usb card reader that i can attach directly to my computers usb port. i took this camera to japan and it was great. i only had one day where i ran out of battery power but that was my own fault. this is a highly recommended camera by me ",positive

" i purchased the axion 10.4 frame for my wife to replace a defective polaroid frame from a different source. the axion stacked up quite nicely to the other more expensive frame. the axion is viewable from more angles than the polaroid frame with a cheaper price tag. quality of the display is better on the axion and we have not had any technical issues. pros: brightness control color and contrast of display ease of setup and operation good sound from speakers on music playback cons: slide show transitions are from top to bottom only. different transitions would be a nice feature. remote does not control volume of music. overall the advantages of this frame outweigh the disadvantages. we have been very happy overall with this purchase ",positive

" well i'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the a/v world. i bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up. this is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you don't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up. just buy and extra after market battery or two (and they're cheap) and some inexpensive analogue tape and start recording away! after you climb the learning curve of course. my one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive and they're splattered all over the unit. be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing but once you've got it down you'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays. oh yeah almost forgot the microphones aren't stereo but they're really quite good for an entry level unit ",positive

" this is a well made head constructed of solid metal with a nice finish. there are no plastic parts and even the rubber piece on the quick release plate is hard rubber. i have used it every week for about two years and have had no problems with it. i use it mainly attached to a monopod for sports photography and videography. the quick release has a clever locking mechanism to prevent accidental release. i bought an extra quick release plate so i can switch between two cameras. tilt only -- no swivel: amazon (and others including bogen) calls it a swivel tilt head but that seems to imply that it moves in two directions -- tilting (up and down) and swivelling (side to side or panning). this head only moves in the tilting direction which allows you to orient the camera in either landscape or portrait modes. the tilting action could be improved if the head clicked into the upright position when you tilt it back to landscape. when you are going to the portrait mode there's no problem since it stops at 90 degrees. however when i want to go back to landscape i have to hold it out and look at it to see if it's level. a subtle click to know i'm there would be nice ",positive

",positive
" i have to get on the bandwagon here. this is a superb little camera definately five stars! i also have the tz1 which showed promise but has limitations. in my review of the tz1 i noted it had lots of noise and pictures shouldn't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp. i also wanted more manual controls. the tz3 fixes and improves almost everything about the tz1 and adds some new very useful features. the noise has been drastically reduced the lens is better the sensor is bigger and the processor is not only faster but produces better pictures. the tz3 adds a very handy function button - or i should say function capability - the number of buttons is the same - which gives immediate access to five or so most used settings without having to go into the menues - of which there are several. the tz3 keeps the mega optical image stabilization and adds intelligent iso increases the sensitivity without adding noise(i have not tried the 3200 setting yet.) increases the size of the viewing screen etc. etc. the tz3 is a well-rounded and very capable camera. there is simply no comparison between the tz1 and the tz3 as far as the quality of the pictures. the tz3 wins hands down. in my opinion it also beats some big name higher priced digicams - a couple of which i own - rather handily. of course the big selling point for the tz3 is still the 10x lens - now with wide angle capability - on a pocket-sized point and shoot camera. this lens is sharp and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results. while there are no manual controls per se the camera seems to do very well without them. pictures are sharp exposures seem nicely done (haven't tried it at night yet but low light forrest shots were excellent) colors were accurate appropriately saturated and vivid (ok. i like the vivid setting.) good contrast etc. there are a variety of af settings settable focal points and focus modes. there is also exposure compensation and exposure bracketing available - and they work well! the live histogram is a welcome bonus. the tz3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode - again with excellent sharp results. the tz3 is very well speced out. one nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the tz1. it was really not to inconvenient but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake. the tz3 lens includes an built in lens cover. very welcome. i currently own five top flight digicams (including this one) and have owned about that many others i am most impressed with this one - for combined convenience and results. it is a quantum step forward. i also have a couple of quite nice and fairly complete dslr kits. they are wonderful and in a class by themselves but when i want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10x wide angle lens or a back up for the dslrs the tz3 is now my camera of choice. ",positive
" i went to ritz camera today and took a good look at the tz3. i'll tell you its pretty nice. the build quality is really good as a previous person mentioned. the body is metal. the dials and buttons click with precision and have a nice resistance. it has a nice weight to it. i took some nice shots in the store. i must have clicked off 100 pics. i'm impressed with it. if you want something relatively small powerful and tough this camera is for you. the 10x zoom is great but on such a small camera it is difficult to hold it steady enough(at least for me) to use the zoom too much. i love the build quality and style so i may be biased. it's a nice piece of equipment. i cannot speak to the photo quality only having seen pics on the camera's lcd ",positive
" i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned. really nice camera. has a nice dslr type feel. 71% of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 (as of today) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20. buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon. you can do a lot with 5 megapixels. i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr ",positive
" i love this camera. i have now traveled all over the usa some places in europe and will be using it in china. lens is excellent. i wish it were lighter weight but can't have everything. and this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom. i have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else ",positive
" i have used the camera for three months and absolutely love it! the pictures are crisp (even very close-ups) and the video feature is right up there. sound pick-up is excellent. i have created two dvd's combining videos and still pictures. folks have thought the quality was very good. the battery life was rated very good and i have found this to be true. i carry the camera with me nearly everywhere i go. people are impressed with the size. drawbacks? because of its size there are no connections from the camera to a computer tv or battery charger. the docking station is small and lightweight. because of the battery life i have never been away from home long enough to need recharging. i recommend the camera without reservations and will look first to casio in the future ",positive
" i have many traditional film slrs including the original pentax k1000 (fully manual) canon rebel xos and a canon elph. when considering digital slr cameras the canon digital rebel and the point-and-shoot canon digital elph were at the top of my list. but at $150 less than the canon digital elph the casio exilim ex-s series is a better buy with the the same features (and in some cases a better execution of the same features). if you're looking for a fun point-and-click camera that will record audio avi movie files and digital pictures this is it. it takes about 15 miuntes to read the manual and you're off taking pictures. pay attention when reading the manual and everything else will seem very intuitive. of all the cameras i have i use this one most often. other users have complained about the proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents are available right here on the amazon site you just have to look. my back-up battery was only [...] bucks. san disk 1gb memory cards are cheap too [...] online [...] retail. last i agree with many users that a lock switch needs to be developed so that you can keep the camera from accidentally turning on when it's in your pocket -- but remember many cameras have this problem/lack/this feature. i solved my own issues by buying a [...] case with a belt loop ",positive

" reasons to buy it: 1. cheap a mere $140. 2. packed with features. from complete auto mode (point and shoot) to fully manual mode. 4mp and 3x optical zoom good enough for most situations. 3. picture quality is good. it's better than the other two cameras i own (olympus c720 uz and sony dsc s600). 4. compact. it's smaller than it looks in the stock photo. 5. fast. switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds. other things i liked about the camera: - good ergonomics. fits nicely in my hand all the buttons are well placed and easy to access. i can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand. - powerful flash. enough to fill up a moderate size room. - great video mode with sound. it also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your tv and watch the vidoes and pictures on your tv. - lcd is decent size and is fairly bright which means it's even visible outdoors in the daytime. things i didn't like about the camera: - manual could be more detailed. there is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide. but there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail. - the auto focus illuminator (for help in focussing in low light) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes. but the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions. - does not come with a battery charger. i bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately. i have owned the olympus c720 uz and the newer sony dsc s600 but i think this camera is better than both of them.

" this is enough of an instrument to show you new things in the sky for years to come. it is sturdy and simple to operate. it has enough light-gathering power (more important than magnification) to reveal dim star clusters nebulae and galaxies and good enough optics to show you the surface of planets like jupiter saturn and mars. some advice on selection. dobsonians like this one come in a range of sizes. a 114mm (4 ) is a bit on the small side but still a fine instrument especially if your ability to carry large objects is limited. a 150-200mm (6-8) scope is right in the middle of the recommended range. a 250mm (10) like this one is on the big side and you should buy one only if you are able-bodied. some advice on use. viewing through a telescope is less like playing a cd and more like playing a guitar. finding objects takes a little bit of practice. the 9x50mm crosshair finder supplied with this scope is great for fine searching but i recommend supplementing it with a red-dot finder to aid in initial pointing. you will also need to buy an atlas (sky & telescope's pocket sky atlas is the best available) a red flashlight to view the charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision and a guidebook to lead you to interesting objects. these investments will greatly add to your enjoyment. what more can i say? this is the kind of scope that experienced observers have been trying to steer novices towards for decades. although i recommend that you do your homework before buying any scope--learn the sky and get to know experienced stargazers who can advise you--when it comes time to purchase you could hardly do better than this scope. for more advice see my encyclopedic guide here on amazon so you want to buy a telescope.

" high iso and large screen were the reasons for my purchase. the screen is great but when you force the iso 1600 it seems to darken the pictures more than in 800. i have a s5200 and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an iso is set w/o having to go to full manual option. definitely something to improve! the auto option seems to work much better and i was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works. also the two picture function(it takes two with slightly different sets automatically) saves me on a lot of 're-posing ",positive
" first of all i would like to say that i was very reluctant to buy a sony camera. after doing a lot of research for my needs i ended up with canon 800is and sony's new toy t100. ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but i wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs. sony t100 is the best looking camera i have seen. it's features are awesome compared to it's small size. you can take it everywhere. big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight. it takes good indoor pictures too. i tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good. but then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me. the auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything. sometimes changing auto iso helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes (which would be 99% of the time atleast for me) it won't make difference. just point and shoot. you get a perfect image for viewing on computers. no complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about $80. 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom. also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting. it doesn't have touch screen like t50 and so it's responsiveness is better. i would like it bit faster though. also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than 2 secs. i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it.

" this is a camcorder for the digital age. tiny multi-functional and flexible. no ancient-technology magnetic tape. as with any product on the leading edge there are many shortcomings. let's dispense with the obvious. this device is all about compact go-anywhere flexibility and ease. for best image quality a dedicated mini-dv camcorder and dedicated digital still camera is the only way to go. in fact buying a separate camcorder and still camera may likely be less expensive than the sanyo c6 while resulting in superior quality. overall image quality is best described as ok. the poor lens zoom and aperture is more befitting a $100 digital camera than a $400 device. the flash is weak and will not light many scenes that any other still camera would light. in addition since the flash is not offset in any way from the lens red-eye is virtually guaranteed at any range. this is not a problem with digital touch-up being common practice but plan on touching up more often. low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically in video mode. virtually any digital camcorder at any price will outperform this sanyo in video mode in any situation but a little day light goes a long way towards improving video quality with the xacti c6. also to be clear the video quality is still superior to anything seen in the best of analog camcorders. for all these negatives the convenience can be truly revolutionary. one can wear the tiny vpc-c6 around the neck all day. this causes an amazing change in attitude towards video. since the sanyo is so compact no one would think twice about bringing it along on any minor travel. being freed from the chore of packing up a camcorder means a corresponding willingness to bring the sanyo on so many more occasions such as a visit to the park instead of just weddings and birthday parties. and whereas a mini-dv camcorder requires one hour to transfer one hour's worth of video to your computer the sanyo transfers video as fast as the sd card and usb 2.0 interface will allow. that means five minutes or less to transfer one hour's worth of video to a computer. this ease increases willingess to create video and share video. no more procrastination over dragging out the camcorder wiring and the manual task of initiating video transfer to a computer. with the sanyo just place the camera in the docking station and pictures and video files are available just like files on a usb flash drive. it is difficult to overestate the significance of this convenience. video becomes an everyday pleasure if one so wishes rather than a special occasion chore. if one values this convenience over absolute image quality this is the product to own. this is a leading edge product. to get the most of this product i highly recommend doing the following: 1) sanyo has provided an updated firmware on their website. this fixes a fatal flaw in the audio processing that some people have noted as excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive with other camcorders. in addition this firmware update adds compatability with 4gb sd cards (the limit is 2gb without the update). kudos to sanyo for the continuing support. (note that the instructions are a littled distorted in the translation - what they meant to write is that you need to push the set button to the left to enter the firmware update screen.) 2) the video is in mp4 format and is playable only with quicktime. for windows users this limits video editing to the included programs or quicktime-specific programs. there is an easy solution. first download the divx codec (a freeware commercial product) or xvid codec (a free open source product - my preference) or ffdshow (a free open source product) - use your search engine of choice to find these. second download a utility called mp4cam2avi (a free open source software found easily with your search engine of choice). with these two programs the video becomes compatable with any windows program including just about any media player (such as windows media player) and any video editing tool (such as windows movie maker). i look forward to seeing how this market segment evolves. the freedom from bulk and digital tedium is addicting and i am sure the image quality will continue to improve. for now i am happy capturing the memories that would have otherwise been lost had i continued to own a conventional bulky tape-based camcorder ",positive
" it's pretty hard to argue against this at the prices we're seeing... in short for not so much more than the high end of the bridge cameras (panasonic dmc-fz50 fuji s9100) you can have this camera with the 2 kit lenses. i imagine that you'll be very satisfied for paying the difference. 8mp with 2 pretty good kit lenses for under $650 as of 4/2007 and an upgrade path to the e-510 for all the lenses and accessories. once you make that upgrade what's left to ask for except a faster burst mode and weather sealing. that's 10mp is in-body sswf and live-view. imho even if you're an entry-level dslr user spend the extra $400+ and get the faster 14-54mm f2.8-3.5 lens and get rid of the the 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lens. the 40-150mm f3.5-4.5 is a very nice lens with no real peers in the entry-level dslr range as a kit lens that i could see without going 3rd party. this lens put olympus over the edge for me. for that speed of lens over that 35mm equivalent range (28-300mm) i'm not sure what else can compete on price. if you have to have a faster lens for the longer zoom you could cough up the $800+ for the 50-200mm f2.8-3.5 and even then that's a very very good price for that kind of lens and 35mm equivalent range. the camera has full manual controls as expected from a dslr and can drive a newbie like me nuts but can also keep it simple with it's auto mode and numerous scene settings (which i use a good deal). if you get this camera imho don't bother with the xd cards. they are very slow in comparison to the less expensive cf cards in this camera. when it comes time to get a flash go the extra mile and get the olympus fl-36 over the fl-20. i'm not sure that the fl-50's warranted at this price point. i was lucky to find one cheap so i didn't have to research 3rd party flashes. i confess to having been a pixel-peeper and compared the high-iso samples from this camera to the canons and nikons of the world. it's definitely not bad in direct comparison but after you're done resizing and touching up the photos you'll never notice imho. on the down side the raw files (.orf) don't seem to be compressed and they're not exactly small at 14mb. all in all not much to complain about here ",positive
" i don't like pink so i bought the blue bag. i had bought a black one but it was so skimpy i returned it and prayed until this one arrived. i had no trouble with amazon crediting me for the return either. it was so cute! i'm too old for cute but i kept it because i needed a case for my new hp r717. it is small yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it. i have dropped my camera and it was not injured. it has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera not the big aa batteries but the flat type that come with my r717. i recommend this little bag or the pink one even if you don't like pink...or blue. they are well cushioned and snug but not too snug you think they will tear. the are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures ",positive
" the camera fits perfectly. the case is very stylish. best of all its pink ",positive
" i bought this camera to take pictures of my sons playing basketball. my other camera shot dark grainy pictures indoor. i have had a lot of success with this and really nice outdoor shots as well. what i just started playing with and i love is the video feature. it is so easy to use and the images are better than i expected. i bought this camera in december as a present to myself and i have used it constantly and recharged the battery twice. this is major to me as my nikon was devouring batteries in an afternoon. the optical zoom is clean but the digital is definitely noisy. i have had fun shooting pictures of my kids because the shutter speed is so quick and i don't miss the shot. ",positive
" this camera is very similar to the fuji f30 but has face detection (fd) that autofocuses on faces in a photo. great for taking pictures of yourself or for snapshots you don't have time to compose. excellent quality photos in dim light. at 3200 iso photos are washed out and noisy but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss. option to limit iso to 1600 or to 400. camera will use any speed up to the limit. 400 iso is extremely good. as good as my canon digital rebel xti. usual modes i never use (flower landscape etc.) but one unique mode i use all the time: no flash/flash. the camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 iso and then takes a picture with flash immediately after. usually takes less than one second to capture both images. no flash doesn't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot while the following flash guarantees you'll get the image even if the warm glow of candlelight is ruined. i always have the camera set to this mode. uses xd cards which i hate but if you buy a 1 gb card you'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card. also battery life is unbelieveable! fully charge the camera over several hours and you'll be able to take 400 photos half with flash before the battery is drained. fuji-brand underwater housing is optional watertight to 40m (121 ft.) camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours and still keep the intense blue of the water. literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras. i recommend this camera without hesitation. there simply isn't anything else like it on the market. ",positive
" combine the high iso low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light and moving subjects. this is what only fuji can offer to you on compact camera class. the f31fd doesn't have is (image stabilized lenses or a ccd shift sensor) which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking. but this kind of stabilization is really only useful for 6x or more zoom for just 3x typical zoom on ultra compact p&s you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results. is also can't prevent blur from moving subjects. with a high iso like on f31fd you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too. fuji super ccd sensor provides the lowest noise on high iso you will find on 2007's compact cameras the quality is only comparable to the big dslr professional cameras. ah and the face detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal... it's really great specially if someone who doesn't know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you with f31fd they will not miss the shot ",positive
" i got a pair of these for christmas. initially i was skeptical about the quality of an inexpensive roof-prism optic and this isn't my favorite brand name either. but contrary to my expectations i've been extremely impressed with them so far. good brightness contrast sharpness field of view and close focus all exceeded my expectations for a binocular at this price point. feel fit and finish are all very good. i wear eyeglasses and these binoculars still deliver a nice wide view through the eyepiece. the twist-down eyecups are quick to extend / retract if you are sharing these with someone who doesn't wear glasses. they come with a decent carry case and relative to porro-prism types the weight and compactness are both a little bit better. if you are looking for a good binocular for birding or general use i highly recommend you take a look through these in addition to the other popular models. i think these really hit the sweet spot for price / size / weight / performance and i'm very happy with them ",positive
" excellent! they have a really long life and are the perfect backup for your rechargeables ",positive

" my bother-in-law and i went to africa on safari last year. we had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting. the optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states. our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt. they were so impressed by the is and price that we left a pair with our hunter. he used them for the entire season last year and when he visited the states last month he reported that they are still doing well ",positive
" the ergonomics: perfect. the d200 is not completely rubber-encased. there's rubber where your hands need to hold it and plastic where your hands rarely touch it. the hand grip is comfortable and nicely concave where the tips of your fingers can dig in. the battery door and the memory card door are made of plastic and hinge-pinned. a simple slide latch opens the battery door....and some have warned the latch could be easily (accidentally) tripped. the memory card door latch however uses a more secure 45 degree pivoting latch. usb 2 and video out/dc-in doors are made of flexible rubber and these doors extend into the body of the camera as the hinges themselves. the english language operating manual is a work of art. each operating concept is alpha' & numerically numbered at the pictoral diagram and to the page where the function is explained in perfect english. the reader will quickly catch on to how this well thought out manual is organized. i like the depth of field preview the mirror lock-up and the multiple-exposure capability. the continuous servo autofocus does a better job than any human at following and focusing on any moving object. if you have the old manual-focus film-based nikon slr lenses from the '70's and '80's except for a few rare exceptions will fit on the d200. all these positive attributes remind me of the best most highly-evolved film camera slr's. no wonder so many photographers have been won over to digital media.

" the picture is fine at this price. i bought the panasonic vdr-d100 for my daughter because she usually doesn't want to do anything with the computer like edit video. when we gave it to her the first thing she asked was can i edit the movies? i did a quick test to make sure the dvds would finalize and work on another dvd player with success on 3 computers and 3 dvd players. i didn't find anything the disc wouldn't play on. then i started up vegas movie studio platinum which i use to edit my minidv movies. i selected import from dvd and it went straight to the minidvd and loaded in the files where i was able to edit and add titles music sound effects and a voice over if i wanted to. since i already bought dvd-r/w discs she will be able to reuse them if she ever edits the movies because you can unfinalize the discs and reformat them. ",positive
" i did a lot of research before buying this camera. we could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality minidv camcorder for the same price. what led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a 8cm dvd-r finalize the disc on the camcorder and play it directly on our dvd player or dvd-rom player on our computer. we didn't want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the tv electrical outlet and camera to playback footage. and we also didn't want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto dvds to keep in our video library for the future. for those of you who like to edit re-record create effects etc. you need to purchase special software separately but with a dvd-ram disc you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your dvd-rom on your computer. you can also download it with the usb cable but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the dvd drive and get started. if you are only interested in playback dvd-r discs are sufficient; however you can't erase or record over footage on dvd-rs only dvd-rw and dvd-ram discs. the picture quality of the camera is adequate. it isn't grainy but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting especially outside on a sunny day. it doesn't have a built-in light so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording. i would give the picture quality a 3.75 out of 5. if you want better quality you will need to buy a more expensive dvd camcorder. considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy. you can't compare it to tv and movie camera quality but i think it is pretty darn good for home videos. the zoom is good but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly. the stabilizer is pretty good but i keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality. if you plan to move around a lot use the function but expect to lose a little quality in the process. what basically happens when using the stabilizer (with most cameras i believe) is that the image movements are slightly delayed. the sound quality is adequate but if you are recording when it is windy you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand. the only problem i have had so far is with the discs. we bought panasonic dvd-rw discs and can't get them to play on our computer or in our dvd player. we ended up purchasing sony dvd-r discs and they play with no problem. when i called panasonic about their dvd-rw discs they didn't have a good answer. the representative told me to make sure the dvd-rw discs are compatible with my players. i told her they may not be compatible with my dvd player but it should be with my new computer software. the representative just repeated herself and eventually said there isn't any difference between sony and panasonic discs (interesting). they make the claim that panasonic discs work the best in the manual but now i know better. overall this camcorder is a great value (you can't beat the price for this dvd technology) average to good quality picture and functions is excellent for the ease and convenience of dvd playback and storage and is really easy to use.

" i agree with many of the reviewers--in the mid range and wide angle the lens is superb but it is not quite as sharp as a tele--as one of the reviewers said--it does many things and not all of them perfectly--the lens is a compromise but an excellent compromise--the vr is an added boost-- i'm still debating whether or not to keep it or send it back because of the weakness in the tele-- but there is nothing else that can replace its versatility.--i don't want to keep changing lenses ",positive
" pros: compact and complete this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it's reversible backdrop (gray/blue). i also have used the black back panel for some shots as well. construction quality is good ( i found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel which is fabric and held in place with velcro tabs) sturdy enough for its intended purpose. i like the output of the lights--seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight. cons: only one complaint: the output of the lights could be stronger. requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture ",positive
" the bushnell perma focus 7x50 wide angle binoculars were the ideal choice for my recent trip to tanzania and the serengeti. they worked perfectly for the application needed. a really happy surprise on just how well these worked. as we bounced around on dirt roads and cross country in land rovers the perma focus feature was outstanding and made things simple and easy! :-) the magnification level was perfect for almost every scenario we came across. anything that was outside of about 80 feet came through in crystal clear vivid color and clarity. it really made for up close and personal viewing of all the animals we saw. by far these were the best investment i made before the trip! i can't imagine being without them now on such an expedition. really fantastic performance and a great value to boot!!!! the vendor was fast & flawless in the transaction too. in my opinion you won't be disappointed with these binoculars. troy :-) ",positive

" nikon has always been the leader in photography/ camera/ lenses. others have nobly tried but a nikon remains the high bar that others only hope to reach. when the shift from film to digital began there was some speculation if nikon could keep up with the competition. well rest assure that not only have they kept up they continue to lead the way. the latest example of this is the d200. like the d70/ d80 - this is a solid piece of equipment. just the feel of it tells you that you are holding an excellent piece of technology. but the proof will always be in the end results and again the combination of the nikon know-how and nikon lenses lead even a beginner to come up with excellent pictures. gone is the lag between shots. you can fire up and shoot multiple pictures in seconds so action shots are all yours. without even tweaking a picture with a computer program you can print top of the line photos at home. people have cited the cons: expensive. yes. the camera does come with a hefty price tag but it should be kept in mind that this is a piece of machinery intended for serious photographers. if you are a vacation and holiday picture taker then you should elect to buy a cheaper camera. the same is true with the difficulty of the multitude of small buttons dials and switches. there are too many and they can be overwhelming but only to someone who is in the point and shoot school of picture taking. anyone else will relish the options that nikon has provided us with on the d200. room for improvement? well the battery life is nowhere near as good as the d70 which i upgraded from but that is a weak complaint as you can still get hundreds of shots on one charge. also it would be a boon if the flash would automatically pop up when needed like in former models. so if you are serious about photography and always have one at the ready this is the one for you ",positive

" overall its a fine viewer however it has a couple of problems. #1) it would be really nice if there was a way to copy pictures off of a sd card and into memory and vice versa. this would be invaluable for moving pictures around without having to hook things up to a computer. #2) hooking it up to a computer is a pain instructions are not helpful. if you are using the viewer to look at images off of sd cards in remote places (ie trailcamera) it works fine but i'd like the ability to move pictures off of a card into the viewers internal memory so i can leave the card with the trailcamera. #3 this is nasty if you cycle through the pictures too fast you can crash the viewer. upon resetting it it will say there are no pictures found on the memory card. powering off swapping cards wont help it read. the pictures are still there however but you need to then access the card directly through a computer to extract. reformat the card and it will be fine with the reader. for what i use it for i like it even though it has quirks that must be worked around.

" images from this camera are very high quality. the 18x optical zoom is very usable with only minimal distortion noticeable at the extremes. the optical image stabilization system (based on stabilizing the ccd image sensor instead of lens elements) is quite good and performed well under several different circumstances (moving car boat shaky hands). my main gripe with this camera is the lack of high speed usb 2.0 support. the fine print says that the usb interface is full speed which means a maximum transfer rate of 12 mbit/s instead of the 480 mbit/s possible with high speed usb. so downloading photos from the camera through the usb interface is painfully slow compared to most current generation digital cameras such as a canon sd900. the software provided with the camera is somewhat difficult to use and is slow and unresponsive. it would also be desirable if the camera could accept a lithium ion rechargeable battery in addition or instead of the 4 aa batteries it uses. but battery life with both alkaline and rechargeable nimh aa batteries was adequate.

" i've been using 35mm slr cameras for over 30 years. for the last 9 or 10 years i have gone through several under $400 digital cameras as the technology has improved. this kodak z710 is a very economical compromise. the built-in 10x optical zoom is a great feature. the z710 does not have image stabilization (is)as do some of the more expensive models but if you have a moderately steady hand and you press the shutter button rather than pound it (and the whole camera!) that's not really a problem. another feature of this camera that i really appreciate is the manual settings position which allows much more creative control of a shot. check out the kodak web site for more information on this. i bought this camera from an amazon dealer for less than $200 shipped to me. that's cheaper than a reconditioned unit (same model!) recently sold on ebay ",positive
" i made the decision to buy this camera based on the many very positive user reviews. it replaces a six year old 2.1 megapixel camera. i am not disappointed. amazon's price is very good for a 7.1 megapixel camera with a boatload of features. it is also considerably lighter in weight than the older camera. later i read reviews by experts who give it only mediocre scores for picture quality. they criticize it for no image stabilization leading to blur (especially at higher power zoom) and noise at film speeds over 100 asa. i set up a couple of situations in which both problems should have been very apparent. then i enlarged smaller portions of the frames to print inexpensive 4 x 6 test photos. had i printed the full frame the print would have been larger than an 8 x 10. i just do not see the problems the experts criticize. the colors are rich and vibrant. i really appreciate the wide range of controls. the user can choose a from a number of modes fitted to various situations. these result in a faster shutter speed or more depth of field or fill-in flash etc. it is not necessary to memorize the tiny icons on the selector dial. an on-screen prompt tells you what each mode does. i also like the amount of control in the manual mode. the user can choose the asa rating shutter speed apeture opening and electronic flash mode. the manual tells how to set the camera for special situations like photographing documents. when you take the picture the through the lens screen goes black for part of a second. you know the picture has been taken unlike a camera with an optical finder. the camera is very intuitive for first time use. i also read most of the manual on-line while waiting for delivery and handled the camera several times in a local discount store. when i first installed the software i restarted the computer but it repeatedly would not recognize the camera. i switched to another usb cord and it worked fine immediately. then it also began to work with the original usb cord. i had even checked for a loose connection. who knows what that was about! one little thing to keep in mind is this. if the camera is set on continuous auto focus you can aim and shoot. if it is set on one-time auto focus you must press the shutter halfway down and wait for the green light before shooting if you want sharp pictures. i do not know but expect the difference is battery life. a 1 gb memory card can store 485 pictures at the 7.1 megapixel resolution ",positive
" this 10-20mm lens is equivalent to a 15-30mm in a 35mm film camera so it's an ultra-wide lens at 10mm. i was pleasantly surprised at how sharp the images are from this lens; and it's rectilinear which means that straight lines in real life remain straight in the photograph. it is a well-made lens made with high-grade materials. what this lens excels at is when you want to photograph sweeping landscapes close-quarters interior photography and in architectural photography where you don't mind the exaggerated converging lines that an ultrawide produces. personally that's what i like so i'm very happy with this sigma 10-20mm ",positive
" not only is this beauty wide i have found the lens is very sharp to on my d200! it is built solid and focus's fast and i don't have any problem with distortion because i use dxo optics software and it cleans it up automaticly! buy this lens it is cheap for what you get ",positive
" i've been using the sigma 10-20mm about twice or three times a month and i am very pleased. at such a wide angle you will most like need to de-fish your final shot which can be remedied with cs2 or some other image processing software. at 10-20mm the range is almost too wide but after further usage i got used to it. i'm very accustomed to a 12-24mm range and the 10-20mm took a lot of getting used to. the only drawbacks i know of in using this lens is that it is really prone to flare (despite the marketing by sigma stating that the new lens coating diminishes flare) and the biggest aperture is f/4 which is variable pending on the focal length. it is not a fixed aperture lens. i also find that this lens is at it's sharpest around f/8-f/11 and i wouldn't go beyond that because i started noticing the degrading of image quality at very small apertures with this lens. but other than that i've been pretty satisfied for the price i paid for this ultra wide angle lens. i still would prefer nikon's 12-24mm but i'm not willing to shell out that much money on a wide angle lens. sigma's price for their 10-20mm is acceptable ",positive
" shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability which to me is absolutely awful! personally i hate zoom lenses. i've got a full set of nikon primes. and while i'd prefer a prime lens these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr. i like this lens because it goes wide on digital. i suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives. for anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time 2mm is a significant difference in field of view on short lenses. as the focal length increases (eg from 400mm to 600mm) the difference in angle of view is not very large. but the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though only 2mm is no laughing matter and if you don't believe me you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself. if you end up deciding to get a 12mm you want to buy the sigma 12mm (i think it is 12-24mm?) because that lens covers full 35mm frame (and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing)! also if sigma or nikon reads this review please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime! and if sigma reads this review i want some f1.2 or f1.0 afd primes! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length! i would definitely buy (full frame coverage of course) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele! neither nikon nor canon makes anything like that (well canon kind of does/did) so you'd have the market segment dominated ",positive
" i have been shooting away for the last few weeks. the olympus 720 is a gem. i must have filled up my card 3-4 times so far. being new to the digital camera era i am finding that it is not as hard as i thought it would be. shoot pop the card into the card reader copy to computer upload to walmart's photo service and i have my prints mailed to my house in a few days. i am happy that everything was included with the kit. i would have never known what i needed and it basically has everything covered ",positive
" this is a cool implimentation of a much needed device for those with d200s. the camera loves batteries. having two is good! having the ability to watch one drain and knowing there's another on standbye is a fine feeling. knowing that there are two more batteries in the case waiting is even better! for a full day of shooting you need this and some serious memory. highly recommended. also handles aas... always good in field conditions ",positive

" i have been using this scope on the beach at night to monitor sea turtle nesting. when up close the image is excellent but not so good for far away (more than 100-200 ft). very easy to use and the fact that it's waterproof is a plus (haven't dropped it in the ocean yet!). you can't really get a feel for how good the image is in a residential area but out on the beach with the moonlight it rocks. most of the time i don't even need the ir illuminator. to save power turn it off and it will still provide an image with the available light for almost 5 minutes. if you're looking to see things that are far away this scope won't work well but for things that are close by (say from one end of the backyard to the other) it's a good deal. i put mine in a hard sided padded carrying case since it gets bounced around on the atv and haven't had a problem yet ",positive
" i just bought this for about $190 at the local px. i am impressed so far. i was going to buy the gs180 but for the sale price i would be crazy to pass this up. so far the low light is much better than a single ccd. the video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape. i plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale. i will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around europe. i look froward to using this camcorder a lot ",positive
" i bought this rangefinder for golf. it is small enough that i could keep it in my pocket. it really helps me with the approach shots to the greens. it takes a bit of experience to be able to focus on the flag. i usually use a person on the green as my target. after i got an approximate read i use the scan mode to find the exact distance to the flag. be careful with the tiny battery cover. it came loose and i lost it on the golf course. fortunately i recovered it amongst the green grass. the cover is also green. i now put a tape over it to secure the cover. ",positive
" this rangefinder is great! much lighter than the big bulky other units. has all the great features that is needed. this is one that you will take with you and not leave in the truck because it's too big. i tested this against some of my buddies' bigger units at known distances and this one out did the bigger units in speed and accuracy. great scan mode. best buy. should be sold for about ($) more than asked for ",positive

" this is a really nice compact camera from canon. the picture quality is excellent. i have tried some night/day shots and the pictures are great. the zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for. the build quality is excellent and i really love the 3 display. i find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it. the camera is very compact but i never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand. the images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp. i would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original canon battery and its available on amazon. the accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original canon parts especially the extra battery. also get a sd card with large enough memory. what comes with the camera (32mb) is really a waste. still don't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card. but overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results ",positive
" takes great pics and the 3 screen is really nice. wall plug in recharger is nice also. i have taken pics outside in sunny overcast & rainy conditions. indoors at sporting events and around the house. in all settings the pics have been truly wonderful. a few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics. however as canon's top of the line powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom. 3x isnt enough when other cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom. also image stabilzation should be included ",positive
" works better than i could have hoped. i have used it for about a month and it is very simple to execute -- but you have to be able to hold somewhat steady which is not a problem for me. if you are someone who has the shakes -- may be a problem. i have compared the accuracy to gps devices with guys playing with me. this is better since it gives you the actual yardage to the pin. also you can get yardage to another golfer in the field and yardage to any object bunker tree etc. which the gps can't. a lot of courses are not marked correctly and of course yardage changes depending on how far off to the side of the fairway -- or even out of the fairway -- you are. this is where it is especially nice. there are times when without this device you are just flat out guessing. this is an awesome piece of technology. it was well worth the price for me. ",positive
" this digital camera is the best. i cannot complain about any aspect of it. it has a huge amount of modes and settings and additional features to add to pictures as you are taking them. it's small enough to fit into your pocket and not think about it (it's smaller than a wallet). it takes excellent pictures that come out looking great all very high quality. the huge screen makes it easy to view what you are looking at and has great image quality. the videos are equally good with great sound and good picture. it looks better than just about any other digital camera that i have seen. even though i said i cannot complain there are a few things that slightly annoy me occasionally. the first is that it flashes twice. remember to tell this to people before taking their picture! after the first flash people tend to look away and by the time the second flash comes and the picture is taken the moment is lost. this only occurs when the camera is set to auto mode. i usually press the menu button and choose a mode. when you do this the flashes occur very quickly (you barely notice a gap between them). some of the features are very useful. i use the backlight mode quite often. it allows you to take a picture of something even if there is a bright light in the background. my only other complaint is for those of us with large fingers the circular button that operates pretty much every feature can be difficult to use (sometimes i push 2 buttons at once or the complete wrong one). but everything else that this camera can do cancels it out. this camera has more features and better quality than many larger and more expensive cameras out there ",positive

" while not on the 'highest end' of tripod purchases this one is a must for anyone owning a hdr-hc1 or other compatable camcorder. operating the camera from the tripod (rather than the touch screen) provides steady footage for the amatuer videographer. the unit assembles easily and has stable panning and rotation. the only drawback is the soft storage bag which doesn't provide adequate head protection ",positive

" i purchased a nikon l5 from costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on saturday after i saw the lz-7. the lz-7 is way better in all aspects than the nikon l5 save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode. pros: takes great pictures; optical image stabilization; 6x zoom; and great price. it is also made in japan not china as the nikon l5 is. cons: fixed zoom while in movie mode; no on-board camera speakers ",positive

" upgrading to the tz3 from a 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel. waited a few months to purchase when i heard the tz1 was being updated. with the tz3 panasonic has fixed the main complaints about the tz1 which were: no build in lens cover noisy images at higher iso speeds. imo the build in lens cover alone is wirth the price permium over the tz1. as others have said this camera has a great build quality easy operation and a high-quality look. i ordered the black model and was pleasantly surprised when i opened the box. it has the look of a retro 35mm cartridge camera which is cool. the chrome (or polished stainless steel cant tell) is first rate and looks great with the matte black case. the lcd is huge and bright. the camera's simple mode does a great job the the other modes are fully customizable. the zoom is fantastic but you need a really steady hand at full zoom even with optical stabilization turned on. i did take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way in from my car as i came across a herd of deer. shot to shot speed is really great unless you are using the flash. the red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i have used. overall i am extremely pleased. if you are looking for a great zoom camera in a small form factor you should seriously consider the dmc-tz3 ",positive
" i had a previous generic charger that did not work. well if you go with this one you won't have to worry about that. this one works like a charm and seems to charge pretty fast too. i've had this for a while now and never had any problems with it. ",positive
" i shot my second feature (flying tiger) on the dvx and took it to the cannes film fest market and no one could tell it wasn't film. this camera is fantastic if you shoot right. i suggest this camera over all the other similarly-priced models. we have done extensive testing with many cameras and this is my favorite. the jvc is many thousands more and you get less grain with it in dark areas true but for the money the dvx if you shoot properly with it will get you amazing results. for proof you can check out footage shot in a ton of lighting conditions at my site. we had the best luck in natural light with simple chimera diffusers. if you're honest with yourself and don't plan on hitting the lottery anytime soon (getting a real distribution deal/full 35mm blowup) and you need a good looking film for fests or dvd there is no way you should shoot on film or another camera. we shot a full feature on no money and had many distrib offers all because of the look this camera gave us. i'm planning on using it again for my next film. !viva la revolucion! put the dvx in 24p advanced mode and rip the knob off ",positive

" this was my first digital camera and after reading everything i could get my hands on to read about digital cameras i chose this one. it so happens that the last 35mm camera i owned for years was also an olympus ",positive
" i own the stylus 710 that i have had since september of last year and love it to pieces. little did i know olympus was relaseing this little monster onto the market 2 months later. it has all of the features and software of the 710 model with digital image stabilization but 5x optical/5.6x digital/28x total zoom an upgrade from 15x total zoom (3x optical and 5x digital). the price is about the same and actually an excellent deal here on amazon. the 2.5 color lcd monitor with histogram display and auto image rotation has been standard in the 710 and 810 and the 1000 series and i have not problem with it i think it is comparable to all models in this range (panasonic fuji kodac hp). i the bright sun no lcd is going to be really great. i have captured many fun moments with this camera (2 weddings 2 vacations) and love it. the diffence with the 740 model is the thickness is a bit bigger due to the bigger optical lense but that is well worth the sacrifice because having more optical zoom = better picture. i know i tested this side by side with my 710. pick this up you will not be dissapointed. also look at the 750 and the 760 models both of which have optical image and digital image stabilization but alter the zooms a bit. compare and see what meets your needs. also the olympus mastersoftware is very easy to use and with panoramic feature 3d and extra art features unlocked by olympus brand-olympus stamped type h hd this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own. you can edit photos on the computer or right in the palm of your hand. both ways this camera will make you feel like a pro in no time.

" i'm like most people with a digital camera. i take a bazillion pictures develop 10% onto paper and then banish the other 90% to computer storage archives. i mean i'd love to display a lot more of those pictures from my computer but who has the wall space or time to organize all of those prints? that's why i decided to get a digital picture frame. i had been looking for quite some time but was always turned off by the small-ish lcd sizes or poor resolutions. then i came across this coby 10 widescreen unit with the 800x480 pixel display! there were no reviews on amazon (at the time) but spec-wise it had what i wanted; a larger display and higher resolution. i took the chance and ordered one and am i glad i did! the display is huge and the pictures look crisp. colors are pretty accurate when compared to that of my calibrated lcd computer monitor. the interchangeable frames (it comes with a black one as well as the white one) make it easy to match with your dcor. the litte remote is easy to use but easy to lose as well so make sure you place it somewhere easy to find. the built-in mp3 player is a nice touch. the speakers aren't that great (it is a picture frame after all) but it's nice to have the frame play music while in slideshow mode. there is a variety of transition effects to choose from. i haven't tried playing videos on it so i can't comment on that feature. that being said there are a few things that prevent me from giving this 5 stars. 1. the adjustable stand is made of cheap feeling plastic. i've seen other frames that have much nicer backs. yes i know it's the front you are looking at but the stand should be sturdier in my opinion. 2. the angle of the stand while adjustable is simply held in place by friction. it actually has one setting that it can click into but then it is angled too much to view at a normal position. 3. there seems to be a software bug that causes the display to act weird in slideshow mode. well to be more precise if you are in slideshow mode and you choose either the fade mask or cross comb transition effects then the very top horizontal pixel line starts to show black sections. it looks like dead pixels but once you exit the slideshow (or use other effects other than then ones i listed) everything is fine. i have recreated this problem but i don't know if it's just my frame or all of these. no biggie. i now use no transition effects it is perfect. 4. this is not really a complaint about the product but more about coby's specs. on their website they state the lcd is 800x480. great! so i ordered the frame and then resized a whole bunch of pictures to that resolution. however when i got the frame and started using it i noticed that all of my pictures had black (blank) bars on both the left and right sides of the picture. it turns out that the resolution is actually 860x480 (which i found out after some trial-and-error). it would have been nice to know this ahead of time to save me from having to re-resize my pictures. plus sizing pictures to 860x480 is a really weird ratio... kinda like getting 4x7 prints. i ordered this from total electronics (one of the amazon vendors) and it arrived quickly. when i reported the dead pixel problem (which turned out to be a software bug not a defect so to speak) they responded to my email quickly and offered to take it back no questions asked. now that's customer service! overall i am very pleased with this product. in reality it rates 4.5 stars. i'm the type of person that agonizes over something before finally buying it. with this purchase that was totally unncessary!

" i just got this camera recently along with the printer. setting up was very simple. the only problem i came across was putting the ribbon in the printer. you have to use your finger to remove the slack from the ribbon but it's not that easy. when you put the ribbon in the printer it gets caught on something and could damage the ribbon. it takes time and tons of patients to get that ribbon in the printer. the pictures come out very nice and print even better. i washed a couple of pictures to test the quality and they came out flawless. this camera is a value and shouldn't be passed up. the screen on the camera is huge and the buttons take some time to get use too. if you have any further questions feel free to comment them and i'll reply as possible ",positive

" i received one of these for christmas...so i've had it for 6 months now. i've taken thousands of shots with it on both a canon digital rebel xt (350d) and a canon eos 20d. the bottom line...i really like the lens. although you must learn to to optimize its use at 200mm. specifics... 1) at 200mm (max telephoto) you will see some blur if you don't use a high shutter speed and hold it steady. this means that just placing your camera on the green point and shoot mode or even p mode may not give you a fast enough shutter speed to keep from having blur unless you are in bright daylight. so....here's my technique: at 200mm you may want to bump up your iso (film) speed to 400 or 800 then use tv mode (canon settings i'm talking about - manual shutter speed control) to get a fast shutter speed. i also hold the end of the lens (the petal filter) with my left hand and lean against a solid object or have a good foot stance - or use a tripod. all of this is not any sort of lens defect; rather it is typical of using a long tele lens that does not have image stabilization (is). you can get is from canon but be ready to lay down some $$$ and carry multiple lenses...more on that later. 2) noisy autofocus. yeah true it is louder than other lenses but so what. it is not any louder than the fake autowinder sound my rebel xt makes. i find its focus quick and accurate - except in low light. although i will say my 20d does much better than my 350d did with this lens in low light. but honestly i don't think the low light autofocus is any worse than the canon 18-55 kit lens i initially ised. it hunted a lot too in low light and often would not lock - necessitating manual focus. perhaps it is the camera not the lens. regardless manual focus on the sigma works great in low light or to keep autofocus you can use an external flash for ir focus assist and it locks right up. other than the tamron you will not find as versatile a lens as this one especially at this price point. optical quality is great on my lens. you can do better - but with two lenses. my solution to have this kind of range if $$$ was no object would be the canon ef-s 17-85mm f4-5.6 is usm and the canon ef 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 do is usm...this would add image stabilization and 100mms more range but at much more cost and you would have to carry two lenses. i specifically bought this lens to have a compact one lens solution. if you read all the reviews you can find the general consensus is that the sigma is better than the tamron 18-200. plus the end barrel does not rotate so you can use a circular polarizer. show me a lens that has better bang for the buck in a one lens solution and i'll buy it. until then i love my sigma ",positive
" this is a great product. i wish i had not waited so long to purchase it. you must be aware that it only works with l type batteries. i though that it would work with p or m types which is what i have for 2 sony camcorders. i had to then purchase an l battery (np-f970). my old camcorder that uses p batteries is able to charge l batteries as well. do your homework with the batteries ",positive
" my sony fx1 has great low light capability 3 lux but eventually you will need extra light. using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess no matter which camera you use. i'm so glad i bought it. used it for my birthday party. though the overhead light was good dark corners of the room require more light. if you consider yourself advanced semi-pro or a pro videographer you must have a light. my only major beef is it runs at either 10 or 20 watts. no variable for 5 or 15. it is worth getting a long life battery like the np-970. independent power source (battery) is a plus. but no outlet plug adaptor that i know of ",positive

" i bought this camera to replace a casio exilim ex-s500 that was sadly stolen from me. it's the same size which i love and as convenient which is awesome. it has a large bright screen to see the pictures you are taking or have taken. it's one of my favorite things ever ",positive
" as a novice astronomer i really enjoy the sharp steady view with these binoculars. the view is fairly steady even with the i.s. off - depending how stable you are of course. my binoculars cost more than my telescope !! and my telescope is a decent one too. but i think they are worth it. you see so much more in the night sky than what the naked eye can see - by far. they are of course great during the day too. their weight is not much of an issue for me although each person is different depending on their viewing habits. i think a hard carry case would have been the best but it's not a big deal for my use. i recommend this pair of binoculars to anyone who is serious about great quality and performance ",positive
" this is only the second pair of binoculars i've owned but i've used many pairs before from low end to relatively high end ones like nikons and leicas. i can say without hesitation that the canon 18x50s have met all my expectations for clarity build quality and ease of use. they are still quite heavy so you won't be holding them too long in one position but the stabilization feature provides a stable gitter free image. in my opinion this feature makes up for optics that may not be in the same league with the high end stuff: the canon 18x50s have more usable magnification for the money for non-tripod hand held applications. while this is not a scientific comparison this is an example of the useability and magnification: i was at the beach looking at a parasailer in the distance - with the naked eye (20/20 for the record) i could see the chute pattern and a black speck below it; with my old minolta 10x50s (jittering in my hands)i could make out shapes of heads and legs; with the canon 18x50s i could clearly see two people a man and a child as well as the chute's cords - pretty impressive. my only two gripes that have also been mentioned before are: no lense caps and the eye cups are stiff fit poorly (to my face any way) and are uncomfortable. i find it better to fold the cups back for eye glass use even though i don't wear glasses. other than that i am very pleased with this purchase and would also highly recommend purchasing from adorama camera - they are quick accommodating and responsive.

" i purchased an off brand to use with my fxf-10 when this case was on back order. it was terrrible so i ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased. the camera fits perfectly into the case and although it is described as a soft case it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk ",positive
" this lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it the fact is the fz7 and the fz30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15% or so bigger than without it. if i can i'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens. the camera i have is a fz7. because i want as large an image as possible of my focus i am very happy ",positive
" i have sticked with sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago and sony camera has been the moneys worth! this one dsc-t10 is the one for the parent who is carrying to much already and needs to pack down for a change. it fits in my purse and still have space for more the only thing to remember to buy a slim fitting case for the camera and an extra battery(for those kind of battery are not sold everywhere) you need that one when you don't thing you need an extra battery you always run out at the wrong time. i recommend this one ",positive
" my family goes swimming quiet a bit. i got the sports pack to take pictures of the kids underwater in the pool. this is a big hit. it works extremely well. i also highly recommend the sony dsc-t9 camera. it's great for trips. it's so small you can put it in your pocket and the pics look great ",positive
" i like that the protection filter is threaded so you can screw a conversion lens right over it rather than having to use one or the other ",positive
" this case is great for the quick day outings. it is rugged and keeps the camera safe. my wife can throw it in her purse and i don't have to worry about it getting banged up and she doesn't have to worry about it being too bulky. everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead.

" when the etx-90pe works it works very well and makes astronmomy an easy hobby to get into. let me elaborate. first the best telescope is the one you use most often. all too frequently people buy big telescopes that are heavy to carry and that need frequent adjustment. the little etx weighs less than 20 lbs all set up (including tripod) and never needs adjustment. it encourages frequent use. second one of the most challenging aspects of astronomy especially for the newcomer is finding objects to look at. if you are not familiar with the night sky and where things are located it can get very frustrating spending up to 30 minutes just to find one object to look at! the etx's built in computer makes finding objects easy - just select what you want to see from a menu and the scope will automatically point to it. the optical quality of the etx is excellent. the manufacturer meade does a very good job of turning out optical systems that rank with the best. some of the most rewarding objects - the moon jupiter saturn and the orion nebula look wonderful through this telescope. one final positive to mention is the ease of setup. the pe models are the easiest of all telescope to get up and running. just turn on the power press one key on the hand held computer controller and in a few moments the telescope will start aligning itself so that it will automtically find objects for you. you don't need to worry about where north is or what the current date time and location are. now some cautions. first the etx-90 is a small telescope and will not show as much as a larger one. that is the trade-off with getting a portable instrument. there are larger etx models that are almost as portable so these might be a consideration. also understand that there will be a learning curve when using the built in computer. it's not hard but you need to have some patience while you learn the procedure. finally be prepared for some quality control issues. as good as the optics are some etx's have some mechanical problems that require a return to the factory for warranty repair. my own etx-90pe had to go back to the factory twice. but once all the problems were fixed it was well worth it! on this note you can purchase an extended warranty from the manufacturer at a reasonable price and i would recommend doing so ",positive
" due to a canoe accident on vacation mine went completely underwater for at least 5-10 seconds. but - only a trickle of water got inside. once that dried out much to my surprise both the af and vr functions worked fine. all that's left is two small water spots on the inside of the objective lens (okavango delta water is clean!). don't try this at home. next time i'm even near a canoe i'll have everything in dry bags.

" i needed a tele lens to complement my d50 purchase. a didn't want to spend too much money on it but i needed one that a least matched my lumix fz10 in sharpness. this certainly did and the vr really works i am able to take sharp pictures up to 1/40. my d50 flies on it ",positive
" i would like to add to the reviews already posted especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 vr. this is one of the only times i can remember when i have had the money to buy a nikon lens but have not been able to bring myself to do it. the 80-400 is 6 years old uses ancient mechanical (slow) focus and has yet to be updated with vrii technology. all that and it still costs more than the pro-quality canon 100-400 is which has canon's af-s equivalent too! that said i like long yet portable lenses and after giving myself fits decided to settle for the 70-300 because it has vrii and af-s. if you are in the same boat then buy this lens it is a gem for its intended purpose. i get sharp results wide open at 300 and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures. i would have loved this lens if it was an f/3.5 but even at 4.5-5.6 i have really been surprised at the results. save the $1000+ until nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur ",positive
" this digital camera is awesome. i have no problem with the batteries. i made sure i put the good batteries in (no cheap ones). i looked at purchasing a canon and a hp but the features it had on this one was outstanding and for the price. i purchased this camera with the 1gb card with it. i can't wait to start using it when i go to san diego in march..... awesome digital camera...... you won't be sorry on this purchase...

" i see a lot of people have had trouble tracking baseballs with this thing. i've owned one for 3 years and it works pretty well. i will give some tips on it: !!!if you throw at a respectable speed and don't follow the correct procedure it will not work - there will be no reading!! 1) don't stand behind a metal fence. the chain links with the plastic coating over them will work but for whatever reason exposed metal interferes with the signal. 2) the focus beam of the radar gun is very narrow. the whole idea is to keep the beam on the ball as long as possible. just having the ball pass through the radar beam is not enough. you need to keep the beam on the ball for practically the whole pitch. 3) use rechargable batteries... and this isn't to save money. some of the better energizer rechargable are high amperage 1350 ma and up. the gun tends to respond better to this as its pretty power hungry. you will get more consistant readings with better batteries. non-rechargable batteries cannot provide the same level of current (usually 850 ma or less) which seem to effect the gun. so how would you properly use the gun? one way is to stand behind the mound as the pitcher throws. forget about using it during a game behind the backstop. it wont work. try line up the pitchers release point and the plate then situate your gun so that it fires on this imaginary line (connecting pitchers hand and the target. you may have to slightly change the angle of the gun to track the pitch which can be slightly tricky. follow the ball with the gun as long as you can. for a sure fire way to clock a throw get a cheap net and stand behind it. you will register it every time. you will also have the most accurate reading ",positive
" this is a pretty accurate radar gun for baseball as far as i can tell. if you follow the directions and are as close to the action as possible and at a straight on angle it looks like its correct in the + - 1 mph statement. however this is a cool gadget but if you are serious about speed and would like more versatility then your going to have to go with the official mlb jugs gun...but at a much higher price. good luck ",positive
" this is a nice lightweight tripod from sony. stable and well built. i have used it with both still and video cameras without any problems. it would be nice if it came with a travel bag of some sort ",positive
" bought this tripod to use with my spotting scope for target shooting. easy attachment to my scope and multiple adjustment heights with the crank make it easy to zero in on the target and allow anyone to see thru the scope no matter how tall they are. compact and lite to carry makes it easy to transport to and from the range ",positive
" i bought this camera to replace a high mp sony pocket camera and i am thrilled with it. the picture quality is absolutely gorgeous in any lighting. the red eye reduction really works and gets rid of the red-eye before it ever gets to the memory card. it has a compact flash card memory system which is great because big compact flash cards are much more afforadable than the other types of cards. this camera is better than my brother's canon slr in terms of picture quality but not nearly as bulky and cumbersome. the battery life is fantastic. one other nice feature is the screen at the top of the camera which lets you see how many pictures you have and the batter life mode etc without opening the screen. the only drawbacks to this camera are (1) not the biggest zoom lens but plenty enough for the typical photographer (2) the screen could be bigger but still acceptable and (3) when you have the screen open you can't use the viewfinder which is a little annoying but not a big deal. i have owned 4 other high-end digital cameras and this is by far the best one i have ever used.

" this film seems a lot better than kodak max 400 even though it is basically the same thing (except for the fact that it's black and white). i wouldn't recommend this for proffesionals but it's great for the average person ",positive
" for the price you get a lot out of this camera. 6x zoom stabilized the images comes out great at full zoom (2 stabilization mode). the aid of a histogram will tell you the right exposure to set for your picture. the multiple program modes just about lets you take a great picture under different situation! controls are easy to use and get to. in all definitely a great buy for the price. the down side is that movie mode has no sound but if that is a factor then get the dmc-lz5 or a camcorder.

" easy to learn takes very good photos in well-lighted areas but you do need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities aren't that great. very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - a bit slow to recharge from a flash though and there's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken (not so great for fast action shots even though it touts a sports mode). it's a good beginner's camera a good pocket-style camera but certainly not to be mistaken for a high-end unit.

" set the diffusion to 'stun' when you don't want your flash to 'kill' with harsh sharp shadowy edges. yes you need this if you have an sb-600. why? nikon doesn't make a diffuser for that model. basically it fits snugly on the tip of the flash slides off and on easy will also protect your flashbulb from acidental nicks like that macro shot of the benihana chefs. here's what it does: diffuses your flash without having to go all into your menu settings and make adjustments. simple sherlock. the omni-bounce (what an imaginative name for a piece of shaped plastic) performs as expected no real cons except shipping adds almost 50% to the price so check your local camera shop to see if they have it in stock before ordering ",positive
" this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash. it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro. this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly. it snaps on and off easily. angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill. i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting. it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective. much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser ",positive
" this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed. the white box is for general use. also available are the green omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold omni-bounce for a warming effect. pros: inexpensive solution for better flash photography. a quality product that works. cons: non ",positive
" we love this camcorder! we bought it because our other bulky digital video that uses tapes which we would have to copy onto vhs/dvd stopped working. we didn't want to spend a lot of money. we loved the idea that it was easier to carry in my purse and you could download it straight to the computer or burn it (which is very simple to do and you do not have to download any software.) i have to admit i was a little reluctant that the quality of the picture would be less than great and only 60 minutes concerned me but the pictures is great and i haven't ran out of time yet. we have used this indoors outdoors and have no problems. we have recorded our son's basketball games and it worked great. we read where the batteries didn't last very long but we have been using rechargeable batteries and have been impressed with lifetime they have. this is a must for those who have children or grandchildren ",positive
" i really enjoy my photosmart r725. it's small easy portable takes wonderful photos and is very versatile in terms of settings. i just have one thing i don't like about it and that's the fact that there is no viewfinder. there is an lcd screen on the back which acts as a viewfinder but it's hard to see in bright sunlight and i'm afraid that it will eventually become scratched beyond use. for now it's great but i'm not sure how it will hold up for the long run. at the same time it's not spendy so it might be worth it ",positive

" for the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions. using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times. this flash solves the problem. i've dealt with adorama several times and it was a pleasant experience. items were sent quickly ",positive
" this flash is the perfect back-up for a studio or main/flash fill for an amateur studio. i use several w/slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of dollars. i like that they are light and easy to pack and transport. they are reasonably priced. they have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles. the sunpak has auto/f-stop and manual. if you are a real photographer you will know how to use them. the down side is that if your sunpak is plugged into a wall it takes far too long to recharge (sometimes 3-5 seconds). rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes.

" i enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera. my minolta dimage x (about 15% small in size than this camera) had reached the end of its useful life having been around for about 5 years. the minolta had a 3/4 screen on the back. (this one has a 2.5 screen- great colors) the best feature i liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens. i don't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty. therefore i was excited that this camera had an internal zoom. tonight i was at a bulls game in the 300 section (nose bleed) and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of kirk hinrich. the 3x optical zoom is incredible but more so incredible is the digital zoom. i was also able to zoom into the jumbotron and it looked as crisp as if i was taking the photo directly. action shots are great. low light shots are great! it is exactly what i was looking for ",positive

" i am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit. i bought the canon because it has facilities for an external mike. i am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another. first on the matter of tape drive noise: yes i can hear it if i put the unit up to my ear. but no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer. second they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer. what they don't tell you is that you need a firewire card and cable (about $70.00 total at best buy). you cannot simply hook up through the available computer usb port. fortunately microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the xp os and minimal capture software called moviemaker. i am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit i think it is a bargain. finally i have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out. your thumb easily controls on/off and tape transport functions. it is really easy to use at least for right handed users. all considered i am satisfied with the product. of course if it dies next week i will have a different opinion ",positive

" i am just an average guy when it comes to using a camera. probably below average. i started trying to use 100% sony electronic products because my computer was a sony and sony-sony linkages make for easy use. given that here is what i think of the product: 1. it is amazing how much camera you can get for the money. compared to just 6 months ago or a year ago this is a lot of camera for the money. it is very small fits easily in your pocket but takes great pictures. also it is very easy to use and recharge. 2. a visit to the sony website suggests that sony has new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras that are very similar. this makes it hard to compare cameras even within the sony brand and makes you feel as if your camera is obsolete the minute you buy it. 3. a problem with this camera given it is so small -- do not shake. your pictures will be blurry. i am a typical guy with very little fine motor control. my hands have trouble holding small objects. holding this camera in one hand and taking a picture -- well the results are not pleasant. 4. i tend to be disappointed by the telephoto capabilities of these small cameras. i guess if you really want to zoom in then you have to go to a big camera. but it still seems like the small cameras could offer more. 5. having said all of that in the end this camera is small and easy to carry light weight durable and it is also easy to use. when you look at it it looks well made. i ended up giving the camera to my in-laws because they lost theirs. my in-laws tend to be technologically challenged. i said to them just leave the dial set to the little green camera and snap away. i have to say - they love this camera. overall. for the money a great purchase technology is amazing. just grab it with two hands or develop a steadier aim than i have.

" this lens hood designed specificaly for the coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory. it does more than just protecting the lens which it certainly does esp. for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid. (don't forget murphy's law.) but the lens hood can also improve your picture quality. as with slr lenses the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture. this is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused (scattered). just use this all the time (see exception below) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best (all other factors being equal of course). the only times you should *not* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700 esp. indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source. the hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject. even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure. get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera ",positive

" we bought this camera because our other digital camera (sony dsc-h1) was too large to carry around a lot of the time. we took it skiing with us (whistler bc) and it took some outstanding pictures both of persons and of landscape/scenery. it is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere anytime. others may disagree but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive. fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed (or better yet use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers that doesn't leave any marks on the screen). to summarize: this is an excellent camera very small size but with a large 3 led display takes excellent pictures and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive. most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it. the only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder but unless you have very bright sun at your back this isn't too much of a problem.

" this is a camera that is very very easy to use. i was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light. i took a movie at my nephew's theater play and i am the contrasts and crispness of the picture are just perfect. the zoom is also very clear and crisp. putting it onto my imovie was also a piece of cake. the only down point is that the still image mode is worthless but if you need that you should buy the next level up which has a memory card slot. i highly recommend this camer ",positive

" i bough this waterproof case for a trip to st. thomas over christmas. the photographs that we took came out perfect. the flash diffuser worked well by eliminating the air bubbles that normally are captured with underwater cameras. make sure that you set up your camera to the underwater mode so that it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance. the only problem that i had was since it is so compact i often accidently would move the switch to movie mode. this ruined a few photographs but also made a great movie of a sea turtle coming up for air. i know that it was expensive but much cheaper than buying a new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras and having x-ray machines fog up the pictures ",positive
" i bought this underwater housing in anticipation of a trip to the galapagos. it worked perfectly and i obtained some really incredible shots both still and video. the combination of the canon sd550 and this housing were amazing. i did make sure to lubricate the primary o-ring each time i opened the housing. but the need to do so was reduced by using a larger 1gb memory card - both card and battery would last a little over two dives before i need to change one or the other ",positive

" pros: compact lightweight portability easy to use big screen good reproduction cons: microphone sensitive to wind getting used to not having a viewfinder bad low light performance. summary: i picked this camera as an upgrade for my old canon zr10. the first reason i chose it was the small size and portability. with a good light conditions this little beast do its best shots but in low light conditions this camera disapointed me (specially compared with mi old zr10). please don't buy it if you have plans to use it for stills shots because it has a low resolution. the included handycam station have all the ports (firewire usb power video) you need to conect it. the big touch screen is a must because the screen is the only way to access the camera controls (besides some of them in the edge of the screen). you can have a camera with more characteristics and better image quality for the same price but if your concern is the size and portability this will be your best choice in the world of the mini dv format ",positive
" i purchased this camera to use with my previous church's media ministry based on my trial use of the vx2000. that was three years ago. this camera is still running as well as it did when i bought it. i use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and dvd production plus i get great digital audio recordings when i plug directly into my current church's sound system. the ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible. now that i am creating a multimedia team for our church i've convinced the church to buy one for themselves ",positive
" this camera is easy to use and makes a good quality recording. since it is an upper end product it does have a longer learning curve than more simple models but the effort is worth it for the added features. there are however a few quirks which could have been fixed to make this a much more usable piece of equipment. the provided microphone jack is an 1/8 stereo. in my camera at least it is not mounted very securely. when i have an external mike connected i had to be very careful to make sure that nothing touched it otherwise the sound would drop off. a friend with some tools and expertise fixed this problem but it should never have happened. the master switch moves from off to vcr mode (up one) record to tape mode (down one) or record to stick mode (down two). it is intuitive but very easy to overshoot the mark. this can be frustrating and i cannot help but believe there is a better design that could be used. the vcr controls are located on the top surface of the camera. they are intuitive and employ commonly used symbols. they are also backlit and impossible to discern in sunshine. you can see the symbols but there is no way to tell which if any of the functions are selected. it is still usable but it is a pain in the backside. there are a multitude of things that could be done to make the interface on this camera easier to use but it is usable as it is now.

" reading the reviews of this camera reminds me that cameras are tools. an imperfect tool in the hands of a master is much better than a perfect tool in the hands of a amatuer. i am not a master but i do appreciate this camera for what it can do and what its limitations are. when you use iso settings higher than 200 you will see increased noise. i think it is a great little camera and i have used it a lot on my latest photo project. keep in mind one of the assets of this camera is its small physical size. this also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability. there is no way to compensate for this in the camera - so know this is a limitation and deal with it.

" the nikon s3 has proven to be a good buy. it is affordable yet takes a quality photo. in addition this camera is easy to use and fits conveniently in a pocket. this camera has the ranging ability to take both a simple aim and shoot photo and at the same time complex skill shots that is complemented by computer editing and redeye reduction. my only complaint is as a result of the user. if the camera does not have time to focus then the picture quality suffers immensely. this camera has only been in use for about two months but has not let me down yet! my rating: 9/10 ",positive
" this is a very good camera for the price range. i have always had good luck with sony products unlike some of the reviewers here. the resolution of the viewer window and the image quality itself is more than what i would expect from a camera in this price range.... it's pretty decent. for what most people use dv cams for this is camera doesn't suck at all. i like how tiny it is. it doesn't go much past the palm of my hand when i'm holding it. also it was very easy to figure out just by exploring the menu on the touch pad. color graphics & icons on the menus add a nice touch. a beginner could start filming very soon after opening the box i think. the camera feels sturdy in my hand i mean i don't feel like the viewer window is going to break off when it's open or that i could easily break the buttons with normal use. as others have mentioned you have to buy a 4 to 6 firewire if you have a mac because the ilink cable that comes with it is a s-video input for tvs. also the battery that comes with it is the 30 minute battery but i would have bought an extra one anyway because you never want to wait around while your only battery is charging. the software cd is a do-it-yourself install at least for mac. it might not be for pc. i'm used to being guided through the installation process... (since at least the early 90's!) but i had to drag the folder to my hard drive my darn self. a minor thing but i would have expected more from a major company like sony. but the reason i give it a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the firewire goes into the base not the camera so you cannot have the camera on a tripod while it's connected to your machine. i realize this will not be a big problem for very many people but since i do stop-motion animation and use frame grabbing software i need to have it connected to firewire and on a tripod in while i'm working. i almost returned the camera when i discovered this but instead i hot glued velcro to the bottom of the base and to my tripod adaptor so i could have the firewire plugged in and attached to the tripod....kinda ghetto. i figure it was worth it though since i got such a good camera for the price (i paid $299 on sale for it.) if you're looking for a decent but cheap camera i would recommend either this one or the hc42 if you want to shoot in widescreen.

" this is my first digital picture frame so i do not have anything to compare it against. i am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use and i am happy with the resolution and the picture quality. the only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all and as one other reviewer noted i had to learn how to do things by trial and error. i also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images it is not saved to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time. however i like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next christmas ",positive
" my husband is away (military) and i was looking for the perfect small but clear pictures for him. i didn't care about the frame only the small white digital system. i was hesitant as my mil has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible. i was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an sd card and transferring pictures from the computer. i love that i can use either batteries or the included plug. everything was soooo easy that i did not even need to read the instructions to begin. i also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later. this is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable. perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are! then when he comes home it's great for a portable album to carry anywhere ",positive
" good product like the price. this is much less expensive than the current pinseeker 1500 models i bought it on ebay used for $150 so you may be able to find it for less (look under hunting and golf rangefinders for this model). this does not have the pinseeker feature of the newer models but normal mode and scan mode work perfectly for ranging flags that have no reflectors (although you may need to try more than one time and have relatively stable hands). i was able to range a flag at 270 yards and was able to range the top of a telephone pole at 375 yards (but it was windy so the flag was straight out and a little cloudy). i would estimate that this will work for ranging flags on a calm sunny day (these don't work as well on a sunny day because the laser used is a visible light laser and gets a little interference from sunlight) at 215-230 yards for a flag (which is what i need it for). less expensive alternative than the pinseeker and i really like the performance very impressed.

" for an all-purpose color film i nearly always shoot fuji's 200 speed. it has the cooler tones that i prefer in my images and a good saturation level. the only drawback that i've seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way over-priced! the only place that i've seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets. any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less and you won't have to wait for it to ship ",positive

" this is a pretty good camera loaded with lots of features. the pros include the 10x optical zoom use of sd card and battery consumption. also with this camera you have the ability to buy add-ons such as zoom lenses and such - makes it nice for those that are just past beginner experience. there are a couple of cons that i've found the most important being the picture quality. although it does have the capability to take great photos you have to make sure and wait several seconds between shots to ensure that they'll come out looking great (in my opinion anyway). the size is okay although it is kinda bulky for being so small. i prefer something that size to also be slim - it's not so easy to carry around because of this. overall this camera is very easy to use ",positive
" have had the camera a short time and have grown to love its features and capabilities. do purchase the 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens; for the price it is a nice lens. i tried the image stabilizer by shooting a picture of the air conditioner on my neighbor's roof using 200 mm telephoto. when you enlarge the image you can read the label for the brand name! without the image stabilizer it is a blur. i did the same for a book about 100 ft away and using 200 mm setting. without image stabilizer the title is blurred; with the image stabilizer it is sharp. a very nice feature is you can take an image and then enlarge a portion of it and save or use filters to make them bw soft more bright or with different color tones. people report that under tungsten light the auto setting gives a yellow tone without flash. this is true. however you can use the p mode which is like an auto mode reset white balance easily to tungsten light and the picture comes out nice!. great low light capabilities with image stabilizer. if you are into action photography this may not be the camera for you. it has limited ability to store a sequence of photos without a delay. other camers react faster and have larger capacity. do reset default from bright to natural tone. you can do this in some modes but not all. read the manual it really will empower you with many nice capabilities. newer lenses are light and small and interface with image stabilization system automatically ",positive

" after researching several cameras in this price range i bought the rebel t2 last month. it has met my expectations and perhaps then some. after recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range i partially regret spending what i did. it all comes down to what you need want and how many bells and whistles you like. for the money though compared to the competitors i still think i made a good purchase. after all if i use it for ten years which i most likely will i will have surely got my moneys worth. bottom line: no complaints with it ",positive

" well this lens does work wonderfully to expand your angle for better shots but if you don't have good lighting you end up with pictures that are worthless. i suggest never using this in poor indoor lighting as the flash that comes on the dx6490 does not clear the top of the wide angle lens and therefore becomes useless. best for outdoor shots or areas where overhead and backlighting are sufficient enough to take pictures without the use of a flash. plan ahead before just attatching the lens and taking pictures. also remember that because you can't use the flash option you will need to stabilize the camera better to avoid blurry shots. otherwise this lens is excellent. it fits easily into my camera bag is simple to attach (with the lens converter of course) and takes great shots without the fisheye effect. other than the inability to use my flash with the lens i think it is great ",positive
" multi-element add-on lense used with kodak dx-7590 provides good wide-angle capability. note that this is a very large add-on lense (screws into dx-7590 extension-piece which costs an additional $20). does the job well in most portraiture and scenic applications however two caveats: (1) slight curvature of field in extreme corners of wide-angle shots (ie corners of shots may be noticeably out of focus). suggest cropping to 95% of original picture to maintain sharpness across plane. (2) size of lense will render pop-up flash and outside the lense focusing system (ultra-sonic) less functional. ",positive

" i don't think anybody is going to pretend that the little casio exilim ex-z600 6.0 mega pixel camera is the best camera ever built or takes the best pictures in the world. but for under $[...] it's hard to beat and does everything advertised. the size is perfect one of the smallest slimmest cameras made easily fitting into one's [...] pocket even when enclosed in a small case. the viewing screen is probably the biggest and brightest you'll find so aiming and shooting is easy as it can be. the range of modifications (size contrast sharpness saturation etc.) to taking and managing pictures seems almost endless yet the various menus the camera offers are simple to navigate. and the camera's docking stand makes downloading pictures to one's computer as well as charging up the camera a snap. moreover according to casio a single charge will afford one up to 500 or more snaps. picture quality? it's perhaps not as absolutely clear and well defined even at its maximum six mega pixels as the best cameras; although to be fair the best cameras often cost three-to-four times as much as this one. so as far as i'm concerned i've no complaints and the pictures i've been taking are a delight to the eye. the z600 makes picture-taking fun again ",positive

" considering the price this camera works great i use it for taking family pics and is wonderful. what i dont like is the lack of zoom great product anyway ",positive
" i bought this camera just before a trip to ca and then a cruise! it is very easy to operate (even for a techno-retard like me) and the pictures turned out great! i have started to use the filming feature recently as my video recorder is with my son @ college and i want to film my daughter's drill team performances! i really like the fact that it doesn't turn on while in my purse!!! my old camera did that a couple of times and i ended up with quite a few pictures of the contents of my purse - anyone want one? (lol) all in all a great buy! 8 months later and the lcd display is gone! literally gone! don't know what happened - took pictures/movies of daughter's drill team performance and when i got it out again to take pictures before sadie hawkins it would still take pictures (i just downloaded them) but since the display looks like a piece of plaid fabric with a marijuana leaf coming in from the right side i don't know what i'm taking a picture of! need to replace soon! i'm (now) bummed ",positive
" celestron's tool is easy to carry easy to use and (at least in my case!) gives me quick precision collimation with my newtonian. why pay for a laser collimator (which needs to be calibrated) when you can use this? collimation is the most important part of your setup; without good mirror alignment all you'll see are blobs and blurs even on the best viewing nights. this combination tool makes aligning both primary and secondary mirrors fairly painless and also fairly fast. highly recommended for any level of observer ",positive
" the new olympus stylus 770sw is the nicest camera to date i've purchased. it takes great pictures and is extremely durable. the picture quality is awesome in all types of weather conditions and lighting. i stronly suggest to purchase this if the price is right ",positive
" very good camera. this was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera. she picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit. directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger. takes some getting used to. zoom lense works great and takes good pictures. where the on-off button is so close to the shutter you have to be careful that you don't accidentally shut the camera off. she is very satisfied with it.

" i'm pleased with the purchase. i bought this camera just under two years ago when i was getting ready for a trip abroad. i spent six months in england with five weeks travelling around europe with this camera in its case on my belt. it's very sturdy if nothing else between the trains planes hostels and general bustle i'm very pleased with how well it held up. nothing on it broke. i probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip if not more. sure i've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years i've had it but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well. the zoom on this camera is very nice. it's one of the better zooms i've seen on a simple camera of this type or at least it was back when i bought it. it also has several features that older film cameras do not such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture or settings to take portraits or night shots. i know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras i know that it doesn't have all the frills of the new digital cameras and i am not trying to compare it to those. i'm not a professional photographer so i don't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot. i don't want a digital for personal and professional reasons. for a traditional film camera this one is the best i've ever used. bottom line: good quality photos a sturdy build excellent zoom lens useful and easy to use features and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks ",positive
" i bought this camera more than half a year ago. my intention was to get a decent camera for images but then also be able to use it for filming short movies. i'm very pleased with its performance. in good lighting conditions colors come out to be amazing. i really really did not expect them to be so vivid and sparkling! in darker conditions well it still works fine not nearly as bad as i expected from some other reviews. photos might be grainy or not as vivid anymore but the stuff is still perfectly suitable to show the photos to people. as about filming it's terrific. i mean resolution is great (sth like 848 by 640 or so) better than what one could possibly expect from a regular camera. and the quality is super awesome looks very neat on computer screen. respect. it has to be pointed out that you cannot zoom while filming but not many cameras out there can do that. oh it's also very small with a gigantic screen and great battery life. a great buy ",positive
" after setting booby traps for zombies i like to whip out my bushnell waterproof scope and wait for the oncoming herds to trample on in. this scope is just great because it cuts down on glare and is also waterproof. it is good to have some foreward advancement of options when dealing with the zombies so when you are set up this scope can give you good range in spotting them on your trail!!

" proving that there's life in the old dog yet bushnell have come up with this the successor to the out-dated poor-performing trophy splashproof spotting scope and i have to say it's a fantastic improvement. as soon as i took it out of the box i was impressed with its styling shape colour and of course waterproofness. i set it up in my front room and spent a happy couple of hours watching my neighbours coming and going and they were oblivious to my surveillance. it's not the most subtle 'scope out there but stick a blanket over your head and you're laughing. any one who has been caught out in the rain will appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing as water really does roll off it like erm water off a duck's back. stunning ",positive
" this adapter is the only one available for the hd1 and while it does a good job of protecting the 1st lense with whichever 49 mm one you attach there is a problem when you use the flash for pictures of things within 10 feet. there will be a dark semicircle on the bottom of your pictures where the flash was blocked by the adapter. i've gotten around this by using the adapter with attached lens and lens cap and having that attached to the string on the camera. whenever i need to take a picture with the flash of something up close (within 10 feet) i pop off the whole setup and take the picture as if the entire piece was a giant lens cap for the regular camera. hope that helps ",positive
" i'm not a professional but this lens makes me feel like one. it is a very versatile lens working well inside or out low light or extremely bright. am looking forward to taking sporting pictures next spring ",positive
" i liked this lens. i used it for the first time while traveling through peru. it was light-weight and easy to use. at 200mm most of my pictures turned out great especially when i was on steady ground (taking pictures from a rocking boat with no tripod is a bit of a challenge!). i've printed some 8x10's of close-ups i took using this lens and i was quite impressed with the quality. it was also in my price range. overall i'd say it was a good bang for the buck.

" i enjoy all the features of this item. the main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure. you can open it without worrying about your camera falling off. the back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear. the slot for memory cards 1-4 (depends on the card type) batteries (roomy for four aa) and cables can fit in it. the shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy. it's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good. the belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width. it can even handle the worst environment ever. hot dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops. it has protected my dig. camera very well ",positive
" after springing for the cybershot in august so i could have a compact camera i would actually take places i've been very very pleased. the last camera i had was an older sony dsc that was quite bulky ran on batteries and had shutter problems--but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect so i thought i would go for the dsct5 since it avoids all of those problems. only a tiny battery to charge no sticky shutter... and it's sexy as hell. the screen is huge and very bright. i hate taking pictures with flash in general and i find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera. (and the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything) however! you can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments. they come out surprisingly well and blur-free ",positive
" i deal in major brand cameras and panasonic cameras are my personal favorite! i've seen people whine about the noise they make many times but have never found it to be a problem. i own the fz10 and the fx01 for my personal cameras. the fx01 is a very fast camera and takes great pics! i love the 28mm wide lens. compared to most cameras i've used the fx01 does a real good job of metering the light and exposing the images. i love panasonic's solid build and reliability. they may not be as popular as canon or sony but in my opinion are every bit as good.

" i bought this for my wife so she could pull out the camera turn it on and take a nice photo. flash works well unlike some reviews i've read. battery life appears to be fine also. this is a small light camera measuring 3 1/2 wide 2 1/4 tall and 3/4 deep when turned off. not exactly a credit card but likely as close to one as you're gonna get. camera opens up instantly takes a nice photo whether with or without flash battery life appears ok and controls are easy to use--either in figuring them out or using your fingers on them. nice big screen 2 1/4 by 1 1/2 so you can easily see what's going on--a nice plus. this camera also has a nice reminder listing on the right of the display so you can see flash setting (on off etc.) iso setting for those of you that use that and very nice way to access the other controls shown for the auto focus self-timer antishake iso sensitivity white background (am i losing you yet?) and so on. one point to remember is that this listing is arranged from most-likely-to-use to least-likely so the user interface has been a strong consideration in the design of this camera. i've gotten some nice pictures with this with and without flash. a nice pick. why not 5 stars? cuz i've also bought a more expensive digital camera that gives me more choices although for the price this camera is fine and it'd be one i'd buy again but it isn't the equal of dig cams with 6x optical zooms separate iso settings and all those other techie things that frankly aren't that important to a lot of users but which do need to be considered in a rating. do buy a carrying case as i have done so the camera doesn't get scratched or lost cuz it'z so small. i don't have any special fear about this but it's also easy to buy a small carrying case to stash this into so why not do it? as in all my reviews i have no financial interest one way or the other in what i review. also don't forget you are likely to want a bigger memory card to store pix and maybe a second battery to swap out when needed. consider these additional costs but also consider these additional costs apply to any camera you buy.

" i've had this camcorder for a week now and i think it works great .. except for the touch screen feature. that takes a little getting used to .. especially when accessing the special features (such as fader effects) while filming. the digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick .. but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer. all in all it is a good product .. just takes some getting used to ",positive

" this is one of the best camcorders in the market today and i would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to buy a mini-dv camcorder positive factors: - very small and easy to hold with one hand. can be easily attached even to a mini-tripod with ease. - excellent widescreen video and hi-fi audio. your videos finally get that hollywood feel when you shoot movies in 16:9 ratio (widescreen format). even if you don't have a widescreen tv currently you will very soon have one as more and more people are buying them. so its better to buy this camcorder and shoot in 16:9 format to enjoy your movies later in widescreen format. - includes widescreen rotatable lcd so what you see is what you get when you shoot in 16:9 ratio (widescreen format) - good battery life. one extra battery is enough. you can easily manage a day's worth of shooting with two batteries before recharging them again - includes docking station making it easier to connect to computer or tv. if you have a good computer with a firewire port please buy a firewire cable to connect the camcorder to your computer. you can download your movie in excellent clarity in .avi format and edit it as required - make sure to change the audio setting to 16 bit (instead of the default 12 bit) for very good hi-fi audio - touchscreen menu system is great. you don't have to search for any buttons as they are all available in the touchscreen menu itself. - 10x optical zoom is more than sufficient for ordinary home videos. anything more produces more shaking and would necessiate the use of a tripod. when you shoot without a tripod 10x is the best zoom you can achieve without worrying about shaky videos - widescreen still photo. the photo clarity is ok not too good. so please don't expect great shots. since the photo is in 16:9 format you can take panoramic photos and cover more people in group shots - nightshot: cool feature that records using infrared light. useful for shooting at night as you can record a video even in 100% darkness - color widescreen viewfinder - very useful when you are running down on batteries and need to use the viewfinder. the color widescreen viewfinder gives an excellent picture and is as good as the lcd in clarity negative factors: - outdoor videos especially in bright sunlight are overexposed. so please adjust the white balance when shooting outdoors. add the white-balance menu to your shortcuts so that you can easily access it and return to default once you start shooting indoors - sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks (best to turn off the button click beep sound). notes: - use a fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times on the same cassette. the head tends to get dirty if you re-record on the same cassette more than 3 times - you can edit movies in windowx xp using windows movie maker but beware it does not support 16:9 ratio video. hence your videos look ugly as you shot them in 16:9 but movie maker converted it to 4:3. invest in pinnacle software version 9 or 10 for better movie editing capabilities. pinnacle is the only software i am aware of that preserves teh 16:9 ratio. even roxio could not allow 16:9 format. - you can also invest in wide-angle lens as it gives excellent coverage ",positive
" i checked the 3ccd from panasonic and the canon camcorders. in that price range this is the best i found (if you have the extra money the new hdv camcorder from sony might be your best bet!). important:the ccd issues referred in other user comments are real (although i don't know if it will also apply to this new model). it actually happened on my previous sony. i purchased a 5 years warranty from sony for my dcr-hc90. 5 years is a good product life so i will take the risk of ccd failure after that period and enjoy this great product until then! great features are: small but feels solid 3 megapixel pictures (impressive quality for camcorder) incredible low light performance nice touch screen great features. battery life is actually not too bad from original battery but you might need an extra. what i did not like: cannot take full size pictures in camera mode (only in memory mode) limited zoom compared to most new camcorders and lots of required extra (svideo cable ilink cable video light decent size memory stick extended warranty). i am still giving this a 5-stars overall.

" the optical x6 zoom on the canon a710 is is already better than cameras in it s range (i.e. non slr). however the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size; the tele converter lens really does make a difference. firstly if there are any negatives they are very minor; the lens and adapter are black - would have been nice to have been silver to match with the camera. erm that's it! the main quality of canon is the lens which they always do well. the clarity of this lens is very good with very little fuzziness at the edge. it also connects simply the adapter and seems fairly solid when connected. the electronics features help in the overall control of adding the attachment. the tele lens does make a difference for just getting that bit closer to get what you want.

" this is panasonic's entry-level camcorder but it's packed with useful features like good image quality 12 lux sensitivity and a whopping 30x optical zoom. i think it's perfect for casual travel videography as well as for shooting entries to the america's funniest video show. it's fairly easy to use and the build quality is solid. a good optional accessory to get is a spare battery. you never know if the battery might run out at the most inopportune time so be sure to pick up a backup one. given the recent dell recall of 4.1 million laptops due to battery fire you should get a genuine panasonic liion battery designd specifically for this model. don't put your life or your loved one's at risk. the reviewer named hung got it totally wrong (or was just plain lying). the gs29 does come with ieee1394 firewire (aka i.link) so you can download your videos quickly to your pc; if your pc doesn't already have an ieee1394 port you can get a pci ieee1394 card for $30 or less. you can use windows movie maker included with windows me and xp to edit your videos and export them to cds or dvds.

" after reading the reviews here and at [...] on this baby i was a little cocerned about its low-light and indoor performance. let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded. yes if you film in very low light it will darken many colors. but we're talking 60 lux which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake. just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles and viola! seriously i have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors outdoors or even when i film local bands playing in dark bars. the reason i wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flash-based camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews. i do not want a tape mechanism that will break nor a fragile hard drive that cannot be used in many film-worthy conditions (think snow skiing as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather). as i said i was skeptical when i purchased it but no more. the videos are far better than any other camcorder i've owned. my last was a canon zr 50 mini dv and this camera takes vastly superior videos than that one. the four stars is only because of the mpeg2 format this records to. i have a mac so editting requires that i convert to dv with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies. mainly i just don't edit my home videos so that hasn't been a problem. but if would have been nice for it to be an easier option and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg4 with h264 and mp3/aac which appears to be the next standard. if that concerns you or if you want hd you might wait until the panasonic sd1 is available because it records in avhdc which is a form of mpeg4. of course imovie doesn't yet support that either so you may have to wait until ilife 07 to really use it. in parting i will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous. i no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini dv camera. this thing literally fits in my jacket pocket so i end up filming a lot more than i did with previous cameras. if you're looking for small flash-based and good quality video get this camera you'll love it ",positive
" i was looking specifically for the magic combination of an all-around video and still camera that was compact and built very solid that i can travel with easily. i have had this camera since dec 19th 2006. i had very bad luck with my previous camera a canon elura that used minidvs. when it worked the videos were great but the cassette mechanism kept falling out of adjustment and failing on trips or gatherings and i lost many unrecoverable moments! i had an extended warranty and sent it back 3 times but they were never able to fix it properly. perhaps this was an unusual lemon but i did not want to take the chance again! of the many media types i've been told the sd cards are the most durable and almost indestructable. i liked the idea of no moving parts for recording videos. in addition i was tired of having a separate digital and video camera and the technology has finally arrived to combine the two. for the non-professional camera person looking to catch candid home and travel shots and videos i've found this is to be a great little camera. it is amazingly small and really will fit in a coat pocket. extremely solid it is also a snap to use yet still provides powerful manual override abilities. the camera turns on within a few seconds. the video colors are extremely natural and not oversaturated in any way and the resolution very fine. the microphone works well and of course there is no tape hiss since there is no tape. the still photos are of fair quality. i printed some at 8 x 10 and they looked decent: however if very-high quality photos are what you are after this is not the camera for you. again this is definitely for the snap-and-shoot-for-memories crowd not for people who want to win photography awards. the miniscule pop-up flash is amazingly powerful. i also looked at the sanyo which has a competing sd model with a higher still photo resolution ability but it does not have any motion compensation ability. given how small these cameras are it is not possible to hand-hold without jiggling it a lot so i ruled the sanyo out. okay now the negatives. there are quite a few but for what it does i still found this to be the best camera for my purposes: (1) the camera does not record well in low-light conditions i'm sure due to the light required for 3ccd color processing and the small size of the lens (cost of being compact!). filming indoors requires pretty good light to ensure decent videos. my christmas tree light pictures were disappointing and my backlit scenes came out looking like shadow-puppet plays. (2) the cost of buying additional 4gb cards is high and i am worried about misplacing them because they are so small. (3) i experienced wide swings in over- and under-exposed still photos using the flash although i was (usually) able to balance the brightness and contrast with my photo editor. i'm sure this is partly due to not being used to the camera yet but the whole idea is not to have to worry about such things. flash fill-in on backlit subjects works amazingly well. (4) the lcd display on the camera is not synchronized to the same level of brightness and contrast as your tv set or your pc which you will have to adjust upwards during playback. thankfully my sony tv allows custom adjustments for each input source. ditto when you are creating dvd's...you will need to increase the brightness and contrast to match what you see when playing back a scene through the camera's own lcd viewer. (5) there is no still photo zoom playback on the camera (at least i have not found it yet). frequently i think a snapped photo comes out okay only to realize when zooming the image on the pc to review the details that it is slightly blurry and i need to retake it. (6) you will need to use the included software to view the mpeg2 videos as mpeg2 is not an included driver in the editing tools i've reviewed. (7) there was no still photo editing software included only video software. i supposed panasonic assumes everyone has their own photo editing software already but i didn't. my canon photo editing software works for these photos so i am using that. (8) finally the battery fits inside an enclosed compartment so you are not able to buy an extended battery pack. since there is no energy required for running a hard drive dvd burner or tape admittedly the batteries seem to last longer before recharging but i still can't see taking a trip with less than 2-3 packs. i guess i will be spending extra on more batteries! even with these drawbacks there is no doubt that this is an amazing sleek winner with really no competitor in its class that i intend to use heavily at home and on my travels ",positive
" [below is my recent review of the jvc everio gz-mg40 which has a 20gb hard drive rather than 30gb. becase gz-mg50 seems to be identical to gz-mg40 save the hard drive capacity i thought this review would be useful to those considering to buy gz-mg50.] ---------------------------------------- i have been using this camcorder for almost two weeks now. and here are my impressions: pros: a) this is a tiny camcorder and i can easily carry it in my pocket everyday. b) it records directly on a [30gb] harddrive. this is probably the most amazing feature of this camera. it has the following amazing benefits: (1) a huge recording space (2) random access to recorded videos when browsing (through a thumblist of videos) (3) super fast transfer onto your computer through usb 2.0. (4) no tapes no cds no dvds to worry about while recording video. (5) facilitates easy archiving/organizing . for example all the recorded files on the camera's harddrive have creation dates as a part of their file information. when the camera is connected to your computer you can sort all files by date and easily separate all recordings by date to different folders by simply selecting and dragging. (this is extra but if you want to index and be able to search your video files say with google desktop simply enter a list of keywords in the file name about the contents of the file.) (6) the harddrive on your camera can double as additional portable storage media- this is unlikely but if you wanted you could even install linux on it and carry with you an operating system on your camera. c) video quality is good for a consumer level video camera. the sound quality recorded through the internal microphone is good: i can hear the lectures i record very clearly and there is no annoying noise generated by the camera. d) the charger that comes with this camera is very small. so you can carry that around as well and worry less about running out of battery. cons: a) no mic jacks. b) manual focus and light adjustments are done through menus. c) the editing software that comes with it is limited. d) the battery life is a mere hour(but you can buy a 3 hour battery for 70-80 dollars). as with all camcorders the still images shot with this camera are not at the level of quality you can get from a good still camera. it produces reasonable snapshots in well lit situations. the video files recorded by this camera have a .mod extension in their name. i replace .mod with .mpg and most of my standard video viewing software automatically recognize the files ",positive
" love my new jvc everio. the original model just used compact flash cards but the new everio gz uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year's worth of video on it! tape is definitely dead and dvd camcorder's 30 mintues a disc doesn't hold a candle to the everio. the only issue i had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic but all the other video editing software programs didn't recognize the everio video files (.mod files which contain mpeg2 video and dolby stereo audio). i did finally find adobe premiere elements 2.0 which supports this new file type natively. it has made editing a breeze.

" i've been waiting for this technology for years. so when i found out jvc was planning on coming out with their 4 gb microdrive version i had to have one. the $1500 price tag was too much though. then i found out the gz-mg50 was coming out and would be about a $1000. i thought it was still a little pricey but i couldn't wait any longer. so far the camera has performed great. it's been easy to use and easy to transfer the files to my computer then to dvd. however the video editing software that came with it seems a bit cheap but it gets the job done. maybe the next gen version will be an improvement. the movie quality is very good. i won't give it a great because i occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned dvds. don't bother taking pictures with this unless you only plan on emailing them. the quality is far too low to use to capture those precious moments. i recommend getting an additional battery (the three hour model). the one hour battery just doesn't cut it especially if you want to review your scenes while you're out shooting. if jvc gave the camcorder a larger ccd and included better software i would have given this a 5 star rating otherwise i think they are on the right track and in a few years the minidv may be as forgotten as the eight-track.

" i went the (thinking it was cheaper) ebay route- for about $10 more i got a new one here and it works. ebay is nice but when it comes to stuff like this i learned my lesson. i've never gone wrong ordering from amazon in fact i just ordered an oem nb-3l battery for my sd500; tried the radio slop route and it won't go over 20 pictures. again shame on me for trying to go cheap ",positive
" i have looked everywhere for this charger. everywhere in town wants me to buy something else that might work. it was great to finally find the actual charger that comes with the camera. it's just the right size and plugs right into the wall. the prongs fold down and can fit nicely in a carry-on bag. thanks so much for having this item available ",positive
" good camera for the $129 i paid. does everything pretty well and your picture modes are pretty customizable. only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than i wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.

" i have several different binoculars from small hand held to a large pair of nikon's i use for wildlife spotting. i have never had anything that performs nearly as well as these do. i am a serious nature and wildlife photographer that has used high end canon photography equipment for years. when i saw a image stabilized binocular was available with l glass (this is the symbol that canon uses to identify their finest optics in camera lenses) i bought them immediately. these binoculars are a little bit heavier than a non stabilized pair but the weight is easily compensated by the stabilizer. once you press the stabilizer button the scene will lock and the effect is amazing. i tested them by looking at a sign about 100 yards away. with my normal hand shake i could not read the sign at that distance. as soon i engaged the stabilizer the image locked into place and never once moved. it performs as well as my camera lenses. as far as the optics they are in my opinion second to none in the world. the image is significantly brighter than any other set i have and the calrity and sharpness is incredible. the night viewing capabilities are incredible. finally a huge plus is that these binoculars are completely fog and weather sealed. change amibient temps use them in the rain and the will not allow condensation to get into the unit. a wonderful feature for those of us that use our equipment in other than nice weather. things to be aware of include: these are relatively large which suit a medium to large hand size. if you have very small hands your may not like the feel of the unit in your hands. second the lens caps do not perform well. they simple do not stay on the unit. although for me this is not a serious issue it is the one area that canon could have done a much better job. you can get around this issue by attaching a good uv filter to the lenses. (you should probably do this anyway to protect the glass) finally the strap the the carry case comes with is poor. it is too thin to be comfortably worn for extended use. i would recommend you find a really comfortable aftermarket camera strap to use with these. summary: outstanding performance and quality. a little larger fell in your hands than some people may like but once you learn to use them i do not believe any serious birdwatcher or sports fan would ever let them go! i give the canon l binoculars a 5 star rating.

" i waited a long time for canon to come out with image-stabilized binoculars in a 100% waterproof design. these were worth the wait. i bought mine specifically for a cruise up alaska's inside passage. one of our sight-seeing excursions was on a 45-foot boat in heavy seas. a fellow on this trip had a massive set of fujinon 16x40 gyro-stabilized binoculars that sell for nearly $6000. we spent time comparing my canon binoculars to his fujinons. optically there is no comparison. the canons while not as superb optically as the best leica binoculars are awfully good. they are far brighter much sharper and more accurate in their color rendition than the fujinons. the only reason to spend an extra $4500+ on the fujinons is if you require the absolute best image stabilization that money can buy. if you are using binoculars in very severe conditions (high seas etc.) you will get better performance with the gyro-stabilization in the fujinons. in 99% of applications you will get far better results with the canons. though the fujinons are higher in their rated magnification the only time you'll see a difference is under conditions where motion is severe. in calmer seas (not calm just not severe) you will be better off with the canons; the fuji's are so much dimmer and lacking in clarity that the canons make up the magnification difference fairly quickly. finally the waterproof aspect of these binoculars really is worth having. on the above-mentioned trip we were buffeted by rain and spray from the waves. the canons functioned flawlessly without a hitch and cleaned up nicely afterwards. these are one of the best products i've ever used and lived up to their performance claims in every regard. one point to note: if you want the maximum battery life it is well worth buying lithium aa batteries to use with these binoculars; this will greatly extend your battery life particularly in cold weather ",positive
" i just got my new camcorder and start to operate it. first of all is's very easy to operate with the joystick the use in the still image function is allways available even while shooting a video (nice feature but as all camcorders - low quality pitures) the stabalizer (one of the reason why i'd preffered that cam over the other) is great and even in full zoom you can get pretty steady videos. the large zoom (x32) is also very nice. overall i think this is great value for my money....

" after much research i finally found the binoculars that fit my every need. the price was right the delivery was right on schedule and the product is excellent ",positive
" loved this! it is awesome because it is both land and sea camera so you need just one! you can get tons of accessories and flashes for it. it is easy to use and the program it comes with allows you to do all kinds of cool corrections including making your photos more in focus in case you shot them blurry! i cannot wait to use it again well underwater for diving i mean ",positive
" i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas and he is absolutely in love with them. the distance it can handle is slightly above average but the clarity is really where this thing shines. its very easy to use and has held up reasonably well. i would recomend it to the casual user ",positive
" it's great. nice top storage for memory cards and extra battery. compact. perfect for camera size. ",positive
