" i've been through four of these expensive units. they work great on my great pyrenees dog. at least they work for awhile. then i end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead then if the new batteries i put in were dead to begin with and then i send it back for repair. once i got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. then i got back a unit that never worked again.i stopped sending in my broken units after that. so - in desperation and impending poverty i switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a blue juice special. it also worked - and yes i tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. but the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. at least they were cheaper so i didn't lose as much money ",negative

" i bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don't work well. the manual is not thorough but it does tell you after you bought the product that there is a one-second delay unless you buy an ac adapter. i just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn't about to buy an ac adapter to see if that fixed it. it cut off my mom's voice and i rarely heard her message. the units also have annoying beeps that can't be turned off. no real volume control either. a very overpriced and poorly designed unit. also the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them. the sound is clear if it doesn't cut you off but the units are far from user-friendly.

" it appears that the viatek product (bark stop pro) is related to the lentek design (pc16 ; asin: b0002q89o6) - they are based on a common design by a lentek engineer. i have used (tried) the viatek bark stop pro and it definitely does not work. my experience was the same as another reviewer of the lentek pc16 who noted that the unit only works on the audible setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the ultrasonic setting. furthermore it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds banging doors wind noise etc. this really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction / quality. i've tried two different units and they both do not work. the negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks.

" the design for using the dc adapter with led booklight is extremely poor. it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter. but it must not have been very big. i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. these were brand new batteries. there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them. this is bad. modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries. i had assumed that i could leave the batteries in so that when i was at home i could use the adapter but traveling i would use the batteries. don't make this mistake ",negative

" i bought this device in the hope of eliminating or significantly reducing the noise emanating from my neighbor's mutt. the offending dog is often left on the neighbor's porch where it harasses just about every living thing that passes by. before ordering i had read varying accounts of its range in terms of how close the unit must be to the dog in order to attain the desired effect. in my case the neighbor's porch is about 35 to 60 feet aware from mine. unfortunately this was not too close for comfort as far as the dog was concerned. having read a number of very mixed reviews of this and similar devices i was not overly optimistic about the prospect of it actually working. alas it did not. some dogs just don't hear them. in my case it was probably due at least in part to the distance. my suggestion is to go ahead and pick up one of these devices if and only if you are within 20' of the target. if it doesn't work go ahead and return it to the manufacturer for a refund (which is exactly what i did). by the way you don't need an ra (aka rma) number to return the device. just send it to the company along with your receipt and a note saying that you would like a refund (not an exchange).

" within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off. this is not the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect. this is my third (and final) bread machine. the first two were breadman ultimates. i should note that i make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average pretty much every morning. the first breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail. this was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time (water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond). i bought an new breadman ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems. this time i took extremely good care of the pan (letting it cool down no soaking) because it's clearly the weak link in the system. within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out. whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed making the machine useless. currently it doesn't seem very easy (or even possible) to buy a replacement pan for the breadman. at this point i was done with the breadman. much as i didn't want to spring for the extra money for the zojirushi and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn't work the same in the new machine i didn't see an alternative and got one. within 3 weeks the teflon in the zoji pan formed two blisters. one is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off; the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact. i have been extremely careful with the pan: i wait for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers. i don't let it soak at all. this is clearly a manufacturing defect. i have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the breadman ultimate: 1) the top of the bread rarely gets brown. i've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much. 2) i don't understand what the crust control option does. it doesn't seem to increase baking time which it does on the breadman so it doesn't make much sense. 3) the programmability is very weak. on the breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs. 4) the programmability options are very limited: - you can't control the knockdown time between risings. - you can't add risings to the default three. they do give you a lot of time control on the risings. - you can't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle: it's all one cycle. - when you turn off the preheat cycle this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones. - and worst of all: you can't bake for more than 70 minutes. this is utterly ridiculous. i'm sure this is a safety feature but it means you can't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth. this is almost a killer limitation in my opinion. for those other reviewers that are having issues with rising i've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount type and quality of yeast. if you *exactly* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast it should work okay. this means you must use rapid rise yeast with the quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs. even using fleischmann's instead of red star made a difference. the breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations. at this point i'm done with bread machines. they are a failed technology. in fact teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology. all you have to do is search for teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance. the manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination. a direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees (eg: frying pans). perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale: there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures. imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread. i've thought about this but there's no way to make a bread machine without teflon -- going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon there is just no other viable solution. i love making bread every day and i'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean i have to give up on this technology. it's back to the occasional hand-made loaf -- it's the only rational and healthy solution ",negative

" being somewhat of an insomniac i read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me. i therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight. if you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons. firstly there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly. secondly when using batteries they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries. this light is also extremely fragile. over a couple of years i went through 7 of these! i would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply and the constant new purchases after it breaks you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. i now have the tri lite by capstone enterprises (available at barnes & nobel - come on and get it in stock amazon!) it is terrific! it has a clock with an alarm and a timer. you can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes. at that time you can extend the minutes. if you don't do so for example you're sleeping it will automatically shut off. it also produces much more light and is much brighter than the itty bitty book light ",negative
" read the description carefully. it states the speaker range is 50' not the microphone. my dog stood 10' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn't trigger. matter of fact i never could get it to trigger with barking. the only time it did go off was when i put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand. even then it didn't go off till i was about 4 feet from the mower. i also couldn't get it to just make the ultrasonic sound. even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise. not just me but my husband too so it's not a case of super human hearing on my part :-) yes the timer option is very nice. this was actually why i purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking. but what good is the timer function if the microphone can't pick up the barking? so read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units. unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else.

" using frozen fruit to make up to 4 smoothies every day our family is hard on blenders. after more than a year of daily experience with the waring pro (both mbb* & pbb* models) i cannot recommend them for serious smoothing making. here's why: both glass- & stainless-jug models use the same blade assembly. this blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit. it fails often and must be rebuilt or replaced. parts are easily purchased if you're handy and have the correct tools. details: the assembly screws together and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart. but this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit that it bends the metal washer below the blade. the assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft cannot turn. the waring pro is all the blender than many people will need but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies ",negative

" i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer. there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it. worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working. one of the controls literally froze in place and the machine was unusable. no way to fix it - had to throw it away. what a shame. next time i will pay closer attention to what people write. my advice - by something other than a honeywell. i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately - another waste of money ",negative

" this product is markedly inferior to its main competitor the pur 2-stage dispenser. specifically i found two main flaws: 1. the spigot draws water from at least an inch and a half up from the base of the dispenser. as a result quite a lot of water is left inaccessible for drinking even after tipping over the dispenser. 2. even more infuriatingly the spigot's connection to the main housing is so poorly designed that it eventually starts to leak water all over the place. the first dispenser i purchased started to leak after 1 week. i dutifully exchanged it for another one which proceeded to leak after about 2 weeks. it appears that the o-ring that connects the spigot to the main housing shrinks when it gets cold. . . a rather fatal flaw for an item intended for use in a refrigerator. despite being a lifelong brita user i exchanged this product for a pur 2-stage dispenser. i am now converted and will never go back. the dispenser is rock solid and the water even tastes better ",negative

" this product is a poorly designed piece of crap that is destined to fail from the first day you use it. a friend had purchased this item a few months back and asked me to look at it when it died recently. (i have been repairing electrical and electronic equipment for almost 30yrs). this is a perfect example of a throw-away item. if more care had gone into the design and a few more dollars into producing it you might have a product that could last a few years. neither was done. look at how many reviews mention the item failing after only a few months... and even the positive reviewers usually have only been using it for a month or so- do yourself a favor and buy a commercial grade hot plate from a reputable manufacturer. you will pay more but you will likely still be using it many years from now. (not too mention that the operation will be better also). how much value is in a $20 hot plate when it is headed to the landfill a few months from now? it is a shame that so many people are willing to accept low quality products these days and think it is ok if it lasted a few months (note the reviews...) good luck- ",negative

" i own the graphite style of this set. i was originally very happy with the purchase - the set looked great didn't chip easily and was a great size. after a year of use i've come up with a list of problems: the clear glazed surface on the plates and bowls can be scored by utensils which allows water/dirt to penetrate to the porous ceramic below leaving stains that cannot be removed. the semi-matte finish acquires a powdery almost bleached look to it after many washings (says dishwasher safe guess that means the colors don't wash away immediately) my biggest complaint: we bought these because they were microwave safe. i don't know what microwave safe means to most people but it means to me that i could put a plate bowl or cup in the microwave heat up the contents and then safely remove the object and use it. in the case of the set i purchased it only seems to mean that the item placed in the microwave will not explode. unfortunately in the case of the sango graphite set it means that the contents of the set are sheilded by the (plate/bowl/cup) and that the contents will emerge warm at best while you burn your hand attempting to extract the (plate/bowl/cup) that has soaked all of the energy up from the microwave. they get very hot! (cup of water heated for 2 mins results in water temperature of 120f while cup surface is 170f!) i've only broken 2 items from the set both times i dropped the items after getting them partly out of the microwave and realizing that my fingers were being burned (first time i thought it was a fluke second time i learned my lesson) and dropped the item on the hard stove surface below the microwave. i emailed sango several times and received no response at all. while i liked the set a lot initially i have been very disappointed over time with its quality. i will never purchase another from sango again ",negative

" this wok is heavy and unbalanced - it can tip while on the element. the long handle is thick and uncomfortable and its solid weight is probably what unbalances the wok. lifting it up is difficult with one hand and trying to shift the food to a plate is a dangerous task. the flat bottom isn't wide enough to really be stable or to capture enough heat for the high temperature required for stir-frying. if i wanted to saut i'd have gotten a saut pan. the lid is also heavy and difficult to put anywhere. you need lots of counter space. as well this wok just isn't large enough for stir-frying for more than two people ",negative

" i have used wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness. but i sincerely regret having bought these sheets. i purchased one set and after the 2nd wash there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on (all the little balls felt scratchy). my husband asked me why we were using the old sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn! i was so suprised that i called wamsutta directly and the very nice lady there assured me that i must have gotten a defective set because that simply doesn't happen with their sheets. so i exchanged them with an identical pair. and the end of the story is that i am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing. what a disappointment. absolutely do not recommend and am now very wary of all wamsutta products ",negative
" yes it is pretty. no it is not a good teapot. i have made tea for over 40 years in all sorts of pots and this is right up there with the worst. it drips a lot! perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout. and no it does not drip from the spout. rather lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot. this happens with both fast and slow pouring with full and near empty pots. this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot. just too much mopping up ",negative

" i decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it. the metal is thin and flimsy and the construction very poor (e.g. little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose). also it was a bit lopsided so it did not sit squarely on my counter. maybe it works fine. who knows. the design and manufacture were so poor i didn't keep it long enough to find out ",negative
" i understand the appeal of having the convenience of a spout on a bottle of oil but be aware that the spout will allow air into the bottle. you may think air only gets in when you pour oil out but that's not true. any time the temperature rises the air in the bottle expands and some escapes through the spout. when the temperature drops air enters the spout. this is true of even small changes in temperature such as you experience in a kitchen. if you don't use the oil pretty quickly this constant exchange of air will expose the oil to oxygen and that will cause the oil to go rancid. if you use cheap olive oil (and pretty much all grocery store olive oil is cheap oil -- even the extra virgin) you may not notice as much since cheap oils tend to be more bitter than good olive oils but it will still happen. i would never put olive oil in a bottle with a spout again. (i learned this lesson the hard way.) a better option though less elegant is to use a bottle with a pour spout and cap or find a pour spout that has a cap to seal it ",negative

" i've bought a number of oxo kitchen accessories and found them to be sturdy remarkably well designed and easy to use. unfortunately this timer is an exception. it has the usual features typical of timers at this price point: clock plus timer ten number keys for input memory etc. but instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers it's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer. it's solid-feeling and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom. the problem is the display. it's horrible. for three reasons: first the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer i've seen. they're about 1/4 high half or less the size of those on comparable timers. second the numbers are recessed 1/8 or more beneath a clear plastic cover not on the surface -- it's dark in there and feels like looking down a well. it desperately needs a backlight but there is none. unless the light source is shining directly into the display there's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers. but that causes the third problem: the clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective and it's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn't a reflection shining back into your eyes . the bottom line is that i have to fiddle around to get the timer the light source and myself into a position where i can read the small dark shadowed and reflective display. not what i need when i'm trying to cook. it's just not worth it. since i have several other timers with displays i don't have to strain to read i use this one as a paperweight. i'd have to say it works very well. i just don't understand how oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door ",negative

" do not be tricked into buying an easy sharpener. they do not work. spend the same money (or less!) on a good stone set that has various angles (i.e. lansky w/ 17 20 25 and 30 degree angles and 3-5 stones: use 20 degrees for your slicing and paring knives and 25 degrees for you chefs). i opted for the stone set (i'm a bit of a purist) but i've heard good remarks about the diamond set too; the 3 grit set is all you really need: coarse medium and fine - get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such. with proper care and light steel use (it's the re-aligning tool not the sharpening device - be gentle) you'll probably only need to touch-up your edge once every year or two depending on the work load you put on your knife. but if you do seriously muck the edge up you'll have a system that can repair your knife to good as new condition. my chef fell onto the tile floor point first and i had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later. the normal touch-up takes less than 5 minutes per blade. and at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened you'll be ahead of the game after the first use! hint: use a 5x+ magnifying glass/loupe to inspect your edge - by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source you'll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened. you can also take a look at your edge before using the steel and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel. and see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives - i admit i have a couple myself. in short: get stoned not taken ",negative

" wow what a fine example of terrible engineering. the only control is a knob that ranges from off to super. to set the thermostat you turn the knob to the super setting. when the room reaches a comfortable level you slowly turn the thermostat down until the heater goes off. this is the point at which the thermostat setting equals the room temp. at this setting the thermostat will automatically turn on and off to maintain the selected temp. this design sets the stage for a frustrating user experience: - by design you must turn the thermostat to the highest setting then wait for the room to heat up before fiddling with the knob until the unit clicks off at which point you end up turning it up a bit until it clicks on (if it does). its like trying to adjust your home's thermostat in the dark...just show me where to set the dial for 68 degrees and let me get on with my day. - when the heater is working as designed it turns on for 30-60 seconds turns off for 10-90 seconds then repeats the cycle relentlessly and unpredictably until you unplug it let it cool box it back up and send it back. i want a refund reimbursement for lost productivity and an ice cream sandwich.

" my wife bought this one from best buy without me reviewing it 1st. amazingly i would have bought it after reading the reviews here. i'm starting to wonder who writes these things ... lg employees? the microwave is fine - no complaints. the toaster however is an unmitigated disaster. i am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances - this appliance is a poster child for this thought. the toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently (sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5 and sometimes as high as 10!). more importantly the toaster broke after 31 days (coincidently the best buy return policy ends at the same time - best buy has an unacceptable return policy but with a guy named ricky managing the store what can you expect?). lg picks up the phone quickly and they honor the warranty. the problem is they can't think outside of the box. they had me get it repaired but i have to inconveniently drive it out there and pick it up - ok ... no problem. one day later? it breaks again. it is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought they had fixed it and had not. that's how bad it was. lg will not budge - have it repaired again (great option - costs lg money me more travel time and it won't do the job) or do a rebate. the rebate requires me to buy another lg or goldstar product. huh? so you create a shoddy product and rush it to the marketplace (they admitted they don't have a detailed enough repair history because it is too new) and then don't stand behind your product. you backend me into another lg or goldstar product that i would not have otherwise bought. how does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here? our we so bad as a manufacturer that we can't top this? their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no getting around this. you can cal korea but they won't change their policy they said. i will never willingly buy another lg or goldstar product and i highly recommend you do the same. shame on you lg - you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years and now your name is mud to me ",negative

(update 1 month later - i tried to give this thing a chance and the god-awful squealing is becoming less consistent. which might be even worse as it now takes me by surprise as it lets out a high-pitched jag every so often. it's gotten quite worse however with spitting out various sized chunks of peppercorn ... from fine grind to quarter-corn sized pieces in a few turns. not recommended at all. i might try switching it over to salt maybe it can handle that better.

" i checked out this machine at a local store. it's little more than a basic drip coffee maker bundled with a basic espresso machine. for that functionality it would be far cheaper to buy those two things separately. regarding this delonghi machine on the drip coffee side metallic coffee filters are a royal pain to work with-- paper filters are far easier to use when disposing of coffee grounds. on the espresso side you have to grind the beans and tamp them into the strainer for each cup you make and then empty the strainer when you're done. the optional filter pods are a really expensive way to buy ground coffee. for only a bit more money ($500 or so) you can get a full automatic espresso/cappuccino maker. i bought a full-automatic several years ago and my family loves it! full-automatics grind the beans for each cup they make excellent american-style coffee as well (simply by increasing the amount of water pushed through the coffee) and you dispose of grounds once a week. the only disadvantage of full-automatics is that like every espresso machine they do only one or two cups at a time. so if you want to make more than two cups of drip coffee at once you'll need a plain old coffee maker like the right-hand side of the delonghi ",negative

" we have had the cordless blender for 3 years now and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen. clean up was a breeze too. the worst feature of this blender the 'rechargable' battery which withihn a year took less and less of a charge after each use. now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once. it does not surprise me that cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately which in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence but in turn cuisinart should not be surprised when i never buy another one ",negative

" i was very impressed with the infomercials on this product and was about to buy the set before i read a very detailed and thorough online review at http://www.epinions.com/content_180924944004. the reviewer gives a blow by blow review challenging all the claims made by the commercial for this product. among her pet peeves: * things do stick to the product - use a flour cooking spray for better results. * odors do stay with the product * not easy to clean - the reviewer says she found a special plastic cleaning product helps. * size of the pieces are small * the pieces are so flexible that if you don't place the food neatly in the pan you get some unexpected lumps or misshapened results. * you can slice through the product easily. * guarantee is shakey at best * and so on..... there are one or two pluses but not enough to warrant buying in the face of all the negative issues brought to light. and more importantly i personally wonder how safe it is to cook food on silicon surfaces at high tempertures on a day to day basis. i for one definitely will not buy this product. please consider this recap of another's review a public service. buyer beware ",negative

" i am glad i only paid $60 for this. i see it's now up to $90. i am a bit disappointed in this purchase. it does slice well so far (although i haven't tried slicing anything really thin like prosciutto yet) but i don't like the fact that i have to hold the on button down with one hand while cutting. i also found that when i used it to slice homemade bread that the slices get stuck in between the blade and the plastic guide at the bottom so i have to stop and dislodge each slice sometimes tearing them in the process. i also don't like how loud it is and the fact that it sounds like it is working really hard all the time. it makes me question how long the motor is going to last. the catch tray is really useless (as someone else pointed out) and in addition to not doing it's job it doesn't store inside or attached to the machine in any way so it just kind of gets in the way. if i decide to keep the machine i am going to throw it away. so all in all i gave it two stars because it is a cheap slicer (or at least it was at $60 i am not so sure at $90) but it works like a cheap slicer too so you are definitely getting what you pay for..

" this grill pan heats relatively evenly and is large enough to accomodate four slices of bread allowing for the preparation of two sandwiches simultaneously. it leaves nice grill marks on the food and works well overall. the press that comes with it is very nice to have as it helps cook food faster. however it has one major drawback: it makes a very odd smell when it is used regardless of the temperature at which it is being heated. i thought maybe this smell would dissappear after several uses but even after many uses the smell is still as strong as the day i took it out of the box. it is enough of an odor to make me wonder about the safety of the product. i have a number of higher end calphalon non-stick pans and none of them make this smell making me think this is a consequence of a cheaper pan. bottom line: if i had to do it over again i would spend a bit more money and get a higher end calphalon grill pan and press instead ",negative

" okay i bought for the price. and it is effective enough. but it is very clumsy and unergonomic so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer. the main problems are: balance of weight and the switch. first the switch: because it is a cheap push-in button which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on you lose optimum control quickly. the handle is badly placed for this as your thumb must always be on top of the handle and forward toward the front of it but you can't hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting. in addition keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife but because the button sinks deep into the handle so your thumb is inside the handle as you're trying to hold and control the knife: quick cramp. moreover as you're pushing it in if the food you're cutting is moist (like a turkey) juices may run onto the handle your thumb--and into the hole into which you're pressing the button. not safe. a couple times i've wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock; either way it wasn't good. then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good. look at the huge bulk of the motor--and then look at where the handle is located and how it is designed. there's no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is. add in the need to be depressing the power button as you're holding it awkwardly and... 2 stars for effectiveness; minus 3 for bad functional design ",negative

" if i could give half a star i would. i had this unit for exactly 93 days and it just wouldnt turn on one day. i used it less than 3 times a week. there are several drawbacks to this unit. it draws alot of electricity to run it. i could use the same socket to run anything else while this on. water gurgles/spits out of the spout while its boiling and i have gotten burned. the spout is also poorly designed the water doesn't come out in an even stream it goes where it chooses and even out of the seam of the lid. the heating element is exposed inside the pot and makes it almost impossible to properly clean. the water does get really hot in a short amount of time but its not worth it. i just bought the braun wk200b about a week ago. it is everything this kettle isn't and so much more. read the reviews on that one before you buy this one. its a better choice all around. save the shipping costs time & headache just buy the braun first and pass this one up.

" why oh why did i buy this useless thing? i have a perfectly good cuisipro mesh 13-inch screen which does what it is supposed to do namely reduce the spray of grease spewing onto the burners walls and floor. is it perfect? no. but it definitely does most of the job which is what i can't say about the tovolo. it has three fatal flaws. first the working end of the detachable metal handle is proportionally too small to securely and safely leverage the screen off. i had to use one hand to steady the metal edge of the lid--hot hot hot--as i tried to wedge the handle under the screen's lip with my other hand. second count the number of air holes in the silicone screen. then count the holes in the metal mesh of the cuisipro or its ilk. the purpose of a screen is to catch the grease and this is the important part to allow the steam to escape otherwise the water vapor condenses back onto the food. i first tried using the tovolo to saute ground beef. the beef began to stew in the water dripping from the surface of the screen. third too much grease escapes around the edge of the screen because the metal rim bows from the heat. in all fairness the mesh type bows also but not as much possibly because the edge is thin and more pliable. this product imo is just one more silicone kitchen gadget that does not work as well as the metal version. save your money and buy the old fashioned kind.

" my wife got this cuisinart classic toaster oven as a wedding gift. we liked the appearance and had it on our registry. we used this toaster oven a lot because it cooked very well. toast was perfect and the oven cooked nice and hot. we broiled meats and made all kind of things in it. we found it hard to clean. we would take the baking pan/and crumb tray and use our regular self cleaning oven to clean those but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven. then after about 1 year one of the plastic feet broke off when simply adjusting the position of the oven on the counter. i glued it back on with super glue. it broke again and seemed to become more brittle over time because of the heat so i had to fix this plastic foot a few times. then another problem arose. the toaster and the one light would shut off a few second after pressing start. so to make toast we just used the un-timed bake function but then we would have to watch so we did not burn the toast. still we lived with it. then after about another four months all of the controls stopped working. so it does not bake. i think i knew this was going to happen because i would hear a strange buzz and see a little smoke come off when ever i turned the dial to bake for a while. so therefore i think the electrical wiring was not heavy duty enough or the electrical system was not soldered well or protected well enough to last. i would have expected better quality. considering how long we have been making toaster ovens i think that it would have not been too hard for them to have made a more heavy duty electrical system for the controls. so like other reviews say it does cook well and evenly but it is hard to clean and does not last. if i were to have rated the product before the problems started i would have given it 4 stars. i wish that amazon and these sites had a section for long term reviews that would rate the quality because most of the reviews seem to be written soon after receiving the products. we are now looking into t-fall convection toaster oven but after reading those reviews we do not know if it cooks as hot as this oven and we want to get one that cooks well and lasts. ______________ since writing my review above i tried to fix my oven to no avail but i have gained more insight into its design and perhaps why it broke. my recommendations are as follows. since i know that the rotary controls and the circuit board of this classic model product can over time get dirty and stop working i recommend that people who own this oven keep it far away from any other cooking products that create grease or steam such as range tops rice cookers deep fryers pressure cookers or kitchen sinks. especially keep the vents near the controls on the right side of this unit away from these sources of moisture and grease. i recommend consumers to consider the newer models with digital controls which might have a different mechanism inside or the models with the controls beneath and therefore the electrical components and cooling vents underneath the oven and not in an exposed location. this might make the unit last longer. the newer cuisinart models with the knobs or digital controls beneath the oven might be a design improvement to correct the sort of problem i had. or perhaps other manufactures have solved electrical component problem other ways. maybe 1.5 years is average life or maybe the fact that my oven was placed near the cooking range in my kitchen made my unit more susceptible to malfunction. reviews of lots of other brand models show short life spans for these products. from the reviews and my observations above i think the krups models and the improved cuisinart models might last a longer time than this classic model that died on me.

" there is a clear echo here so to simply quote the experience of another reviewer after two months the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead. rather than paying to ship the unit to krups myself---clearly the company cannot afford to pay shipping on the thousands of these cheaply made units---i hauled the krups fnp112-42 down to my workshop and found that the hose to the steamer had detached. well fixing that problem did not render the fnp112-42 usable for now it simply exhaled steam in great plumes like a bull in a bugs bunny cartoon. cleaning the unit per the directions from krups did nothing whatsoever. nor did shaking it robustly or inserting various instruments into the nonworking nozzles serve any purpose but at least i felt a bit better. turns out the only thing getting steamed was me. . . i'm going to buy a good espresso maker this year for christmas and i can promise you that it will not have the word krups emblazoned on it.

" i returned the honeywell 6011i humidifier because the product had 2 defects and the product was very poorly designed. the 6011i humidifier had 2 defects right out of the box. the first was that the 6011i humidifier would not run on the high speed setting but did run on the low and medium speed settings. the second defect was that the cap for one water container had no rubber o-ring seal and the water bottle leaked when upright in its normal operating position. the fact that this 6011i humidifier had 2 defects says that the quality control for this product must be very low and implies this product suffers from an above average failure rate. the 6011i humidifier has major design defects that make it difficult to operate and maintain the 6011i humidifier. the design defects are so major that the person(s) that designed and approved the design of the 6011i humidifier should be shot or at least fired! the first major design defect is that the water bottles will not stand up by themselves in my sink. because of this i must hold the water containers vertically with my hand and still cannot completely fill the water container to the top. the screw-on caps for the water containers are so large they are difficult for my wife with small hands to screw on while holding the water container vertically upright. the next design defect is that one cannot at a glance check the water level in the water containers but must pick up the water containers and turn them over to check the water level in the container. one can see if the water container is empty or nearly empty at a glance but this is of no use if one wants to quickly see if there is enough water in the water containers to last until one returns home from work or will last through the night. the last design defect of the 6011i humidifier is that the water containers and humidifier fan housing do not just drop into place on the base. one must use one hand as a guide for the water container and then still fiddle with the position/angle of the water container to get it to seat properly. this is even more difficult if both water containers are removed for filling at the same time. i bought this 6011i humidifier to replace a honeywell humidifier that finally failed after many years of faithful service. i also selected the 6011i humidifier because of its many desirable features. however the positive product features were significantly outweighed by the poor quality control and the poor design of the 6011i humidifier. i believe that a humidifier should be designed for usability first and esthetics second not the other way around as is the case with the 6011i humidifier. thus i returned the 6011i humidifier ",negative
" i've had my vacuum for a few years now only b/c i'm too lazy to buy another one. however i am at the end of my rope. from day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently -- and most of the time i was vacuuming on hardwood. if i accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb the belt broke. i took to buying lots of extra belts whenever i went to the store. the other day - surprise - the belt broke for no apparent reason. i promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute i turned the vacuum on. i say: no more. i am now determined to buy the best vacuum ever. i don't care how much it costs!! the only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose/attachments without having to flip a switch; and it is pretty powerful. but that's it. changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers i frequently run over the cord. something just wasn't designed right there... you've been warned ",negative
" i just purchased this vacuum this morning and vacuumed the entire house...and now i am afraid that i have to return it back to the store. it sucks wonderfully don't get me wrong. the reason why it's got to be returned to targetland is because of 1. the noise 2. the `dust that flies out of the dust cup when you're emptying it. the noise is certainly the loudest i've ever heard on a vacuum cleaner. but i thought hey that's okay if you want to be noisy...until i ventured into cleaning the stairs. there's not much of an extension between the cleaning wand/brush and the actual machine so while i was bending over to suck up hair and debris (what have you) from the stairs' carpet i had the crazy noise blasting turbo-style directly into my ear. (this was done 15 minutes ago and my ear still hurts). the other problem i've found with the vacuum is the point that while emptying the dust cup i am having to actually touch dirt and dust (the entire outside of the cup is coated with it). while pouring the dirt into the trash can a bit of dirt and dust fall onto the floor...nasty and what's the point in the dust cup if this happens? i had a eureka spin brush vacuum contraption most recently (it died after 2 1/2 years) and i know from that experience that the dirt and dust should not be coating the cup nor falling to the floor. so alas my friends i must pack up this marvel and take it back to the store. mayhaps i'll have luck with a vacuum cleaner that uses bags (you know the old-fashioned kind) ",negative

" i've own my x3 for about 2 years now and overall it has been used to make one double espresso daily. so when it stopped working a month ago i was heartbroken. called ff after some back and forth i sent the machine in for repair. the cost of repairing it is about $200 incl. the shipping. add that to the $499 i paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine. after several days of back and forth with customer service i still don't know what exactly is not working in my machine. apparently there are 3 items that have failed one being the thermostat a washer and something else that cs was unable to explain. i really liked the machine when it was working so i gave it some serious thought of shelling for repair but at the end decided against it - i rather purchase a new rancilio silvia. when i called the cs with me decision and asked them to send the machine back i was told that on top of the $12 shipping there will be a $13 handling charge for packaging the machine. i refused to pay that and the rep turned outright nasty. long story short i finally got them to send the machine back with just a shipping charge but that was one very unpleasant experience. it is a whole another issue what additional damage they might have done to my machine after the nasty fight i had with them. i really liked the x3 when it was working and i would love to have it back but it is just not cost effective at all. what is really confusing to me is that with the low usage my machine had and the maintenance i provided it has 3 parts needing replacement - if this was a good quality machine it should have worked a lot longer without any problems.

" i have purchased several espresso machines and sampled scores more francis francis being my first. this machine is better than the 200 coffee maker labelled as espresso machines but marginally. if you are a serious espresso drinker you know that the quality and cutting of the bean and the quality of the machine are equally important. focusing on the machine for a moment. you need a machine which extracts the coffee at just the right pressure without burning the coffee. a truly good espresso is characterized by a thick golden crema on the surface and almost syrup like consistency without a burnt aftertaste. this machine simply does not develop the pressure required to extract that golden crema from the coffee beans. the espresso extracted is thus poor in taste. if you are going to spend 600 usd on a machine shell out another thousand or so and get a good quality commercial machine by faemea or elecktra. you will need to compliment this with a commerical grinder for best results. the cheap pods really limit the different beans one can try and the cutting of the beans are fixed ",negative

" i am looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs. amazon's listing says this innotek trainer comes with a lifetime warranty. i've read that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars so i decided to review the owner's manual to learn more about the warranty. [...] the last page has a section entitled lifetime limited warranty which states . . . innotek brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase. the lifetime warranty apparently expires after one year! further on it says the company offers several product exchange options during the warranty period. . . . costs are dependent on the processing time. this suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year lifetime warranty. the next paragraph says after one year from date of original retail purchase we will repair replace or upgrade your product at a fixed rate based on the component. what will these repairs cost? this leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from innotek. what if anything is warranted for a lifetime? if the lifetime warranty is really only for one year why call it lifetime? and finally what will repairs cost both during warranty under their product exchange options and afterwards under their component-based fixed rate? my specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery. the manual does not indicate that this battery is user-replaceable. does this mean the user will have to send the collar to innotek to replace the battery and if so what will it cost? i have contacted innotek through their website and will report back if i get a response. until i do i've got to rate this product with only one star because of the warranty. can anyone comment on warranty claims to innotek ",negative

" in my opinion the reset problem and occasional burbling are not problems. my main beef is it's too hard to clean. a few weeks after replacing the filter the deposits start adding up. it has to be cleaned basically every time you refill the tank. soaking in vinegar doesn't do much and requires a lot of vinegar as the entire bottom reservoir must be filled. the (phosporic-acid based) cleaner sold on the website is slightly better but in the final analysis you have to resort to hand scrubbing. and there's the hitch! you can't reach parts of the element not even with a toothbrush. why they couldn't center it just a little further away from the edge of the wall is beyond my comprehension. i spent more time last winter with the thing taken apart & trying various methods of cleaning than with it running. i wouldn't buy it again ",negative

" too bad i didn't come here first at epinions nobody had the reset problem but i sure did. it's too bad too because this thing is a technological marval... except it's defective from the very start. my water is somewhere between hard and soft but more to the soft side. i read that using distilled or water with no mineral content will allow the boiler to boil less and therefore not trip the automatic shutoff. i now quote from the review of a sunbeam on this site: a vaporizer only works well if the mineral content in your water is ideal so you may have to make simple adjustments if the water doesn't boil (add salt) or if it boils too rapidly (add distilled water). this will prevent spurting boiling over and overheated reservoirs. the problem is it is ridiculous to buy a water distiller for a unit that already has a good filter in it already! the unit boils like the bejesus on low putting it on high pushes it over the edge and it shuts off with the red blinking reset/refill light. i tried 4 times and even called tech support (they were pretty clueless are you listening bionaire?). it's really a pity too because the humidistat can be placed away from the unit and it wirelessly communicates to make sure the room is evenly humidified. i think the problem is that the water does not go high enough in the tray and you can't tilt it to fix the problem (most warm mist are designed that way for some reason ",negative

" i had this vacuum for about a month. the suction was so bad that after every room i had to empty what little dirt was in the canister just to get back some suction. i hated it! not only that but the bagless was a pain! i had to go outside everytime to empty the dang thing because it was so messy! not to mention that trying to get the canister out and back in was the hardest thing ever. it made even more of a mess trying to get it out and in! i did not want that in my house! i absolutely hated this vacuum ",negative

" i bought this item brand new and in hot pink colored (caught my eye). flashy small & cool looking! however it contains 1 led light which is bright but not wide spread. so when reading it lights up only the center of the page. you will have to constantly reposition it to keep from straining your eyes. the constant bending and reposition will affect the fragile wiring on this thing. about 10-15 uses after buying this product i noticed a flikering (very annoying). it slowly worsens the more i used it. in fact i put the thing away and haven't used it again b/c of the annoyance. thank goodness i didn't pay much for it. value for the money is about a 7 because you get what you pay for. spend the money and try something else with more than 1 led in it. my next bet is finding something with a real light bulb in it or maybe i will just annoy my husband at bed time and read with the lights on : ",negative

" my wife and i are tired of cleaning up after our 4 cats. though the catgenies are terribly expensive to purchase and to keep stocked with sanisolution and granules it would be worth it for more free time and a cleaner basement. unfortunately they just don't work. becuase we have 4 cats we bought 2 catgenies. even with 2 of them it was more than the machines can handle. even when we ran them right after the cats made their deposit the impeller was never able to grind up the turds properly. they clogged everytime and beeped incessantly. another problem is the scoop. even though it scoops 3 times for every cycle it always left turds behind. those turds would then go through the whole cyle which includes drying. that means that even if they're scooped up the next time it cycles they're going to be so dry and hard they'll never be ground up properly. again this results in clogs. we had them for a little over 2 weeks. in that time we had to run extra cyles backflush and even take them apart and clean them. this product results in far more work not less ",negative

" i paid too much money for this tea kettle to drip from under the spout and spit water all over the stove before it even whistles. this is a disappointment! save your money and search for a better kettle. this one isn't a good buy or a good produc ",negative
" got this tea kettle for a gift recently. it's discontinued on amazon but they sell it at home goods for $ 24. 99. pros ~ * asthetically pleasing (looks pretty) * removable top for wide area to fill with water and makes it easier to wash * removable whistle (i can't stand the sound of a whistling tea kettle so i remove the plug) cons ~ * it'd be nice if the tea kettle had a flip up plug on the spout instead of the removable one (i'll lose it eventually the other le creuset models have the flip up plug that opens with a press of the thumb) * the poor design of the spout is dangerous. no matter how slowly i pour the boiling water (even with the small amount i use only 4 or 6 ounces at a time) a few tablespoons of water blub out very quickly - sorry i can't think of a better descriptive word. the spout opening is way too small but the width of the spout itself allows more of a flow of water so the first few tablespoons gush out. so when you pour the water do it as slowly as possible put the mug on your counter or another surface that won't get ruined when wet and don't hold onto your mug as you pour the water because the blub of boiling water will burn ",negative
" i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best. only problem is that they rust!!! i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior. i don't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times. the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so but any serious tea drinker like me knows that's unrealistic. i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money didn't last long at all. i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i'm officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot ",negative

" amazing that in 2005 you can read review after review on amazon about the poor quality of almost every toaster offered. we hoped this one would be an exception. it was but only in that it may be the poorest of them all. ours buzzed loudly whenever in use. never had a toaster buzz before. we toast bread at least twice a day and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible. it has no bagel setting (which toasts the cut side more than the crust side) so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely starting to toast. what's more it toasts completely unevenly. one corner of toast will be blackened while the far corner will barely be tanned. and it's really annoying when a 4-slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently. as far as looks go de'longhi did just as bad a job. the photos look cool but the crumb tray this unit sits upon is actually wider than the unit itself so there is a big uneven gap at the seam. it's the lower line you see in the photos--but they make it look real nice for that! what you don't see is the other side of the toaster where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several mm from the side of the toaster rather than being flush as shown. this makes it look broken like two pieces of something that no longer fit together. if de'longhi had spent even a second thinking about this they would have done the opposite: the bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look. (we even went to a store [yes a real store] to confirm that they are all like this and they are.) also the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element. there are 4 tiny plastic feet inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it doesn't scratch the metal surface of the toaster. however two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping and though they slipped right back in all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out (only friction holds them in) and you will loose them very quickly--especially if you ever wash the rack. we're happy to pay extra for a quality item--even a toaster--but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment. final advice: stick to the $20 toasters with functions such as bagel defrost and dual controls. if it's ugly keep it under the sink and only take it out when you use it. this one looks broken performs poorly and costs a lot of money. if you do buy this model maybe you'll get ours...we returned it ",negative

" the vacuum has great suction. however suction is the only good quality about this vacuum. i purchased this vacuum at sears and got a good discount during their vacuum sale. but i have gone through 3 of these vacuums and have returned or plan on returning each one. the 1st vacuum got so much dirt stuck behind and in the hepa filter the vacuum started making a sound like it was going to break. the 2nd vacuum had a handle that was assembled badly so with each forward and backward pass the handle felt like it was going to come off. this vacuum is hard to push. you have to put the carpet setting at close to high for low carpeting. on hard surfaces the vacuum is hard to push too! this vacuum has a large dust cup with 2 sections. the small compartment in the back of the dust cup is (1 high x 5 wide x 6 deep) for the dirt. the large front section collects the hair crumbs and other larger things you pick up off the floor in your home however dirt and fine particulate dust is what i collect in my vacuum and hoover only gives you that little compartment for the dirt so it gets caught in the vacuum behind the hepa filter. you spend more time cleaning out the vacuum than you do vacuuming your carpet. today i had to pick up the vacuum and shake it over the trash can to get most of the dirt out from behind the hepa filter. even my husband noticed that this vacuum takes too much time to empty and clean out. yes lots of dirt falls onto the vacuum when you remove the dust cup and is messy to clean up. i have tried kenmore eureka and fantom in the past. i plan on returning the 3rd vacuum once i get my dyson i purchased from hsn ",negative

" the machine looks great. it sat nicely on our counter-top next to the kitchen aid mixer and looked really classy. if that was all i wanted to do with it then i would have been very happy with it but i actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos. firstly i found the steamer wand to be awkward to use. it rotates but has little movement up or down. as a result i found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter-top when i was finished. it produced good foam though. secondly the indicator lights are so dim i found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not. finally the espressos i made had no crema at all. i have been making them for 3 years with our current saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one. after pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder. the machine was constantly leaking water & steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere. in summary: if you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter buy this machine. if you want to make decent espresso-based drinks don't ",negative

" i almost threw this coffee maker across my living on more than one occasion due to it's extremely poor design. mr. coffee really struck out on this one considering they are a company that only makes coffemakers. first of all the water filter device failed after a few uses and would no longer allow water to flow freely through it. this could have been due to the hardness of the tap water in my area but regardless it's a filter it's supposed to be able to be subjected to not so perfect water. so before i figured out the filter wasnt allowing water to flow i would let it brew and the water would never make it out of the resovoir and would basically just steam up and evaporate. after the entire brewing cycle i would pull the carafe out and there would be no coffee in the carafe. after realizing it was the filter that was causing problems i just simply removed it and didnt use it. the coffee maker worked for a few days but only if you place the paper coffee filter in perfectly. otherwise the dripping water would cause the filter to collapse and then the grains would run out of the filter clogging the drain and then voila you get an overflowed grain basket with dirty grainy water all over your counters. i do not recommend this coffee maker for any reason. get the hamilton beach stay or go 45234 ",negative

" this perch is a great size for a large cat or even two cats together. it is soft and appears to be very comfortable. however the way it attaches is by affixing a strip of velcro to your window sill which then mates with the matching velcro on the bottom of the shelf unit. there are two adjustable legs that are supposed to give support as they brace against the wall. my window ledges are not very deep and so the shelf does not sit level. the legs are adjusted to fit as closely to the wall as possible however mine do not move close enough in so that the legs stay securely on the wall and therefore do not support the shelf properly. we have tried putting a piece of folded cardboard under the part that sits against the wall but this hasn't worked either. so unless you have very deep window ledges this may not work for you. we bought two of these but plan on returning one. on a positive note my cats love the shelf and took to it right away. it is a great idea but this one needs a little better design ",negative

" well after reading the reviews of this vacuum i decided to give it a try. i have had it a month now and i have to say that i am sorry i bought this behemoth. right out of the box and trying it for the first time i noticed things that i didn't like. i thought i 'd give it some time though and hoped i could adjust. here is what i found: 1. the vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated. 2. worse than the vacuum being heavy the darn thing is really hard to push. even on hard smooth surfaces it's hard to push. i have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag. for it to drag on hard surfaces it must be a design flaw. 3. the on/off power switch is foot operated. not a terrible thing but dirt devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage. on my first time of vacuuming i accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush. while the brush belt was smoking i fumbled around for the damn power switch. i finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because i couldn't find it by looking down. it must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off. unfortunately the damage was done. the belt snapped. how nice. i really liked that. first time out and the belt snapped. another note about the switch; there have been times i have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off. it takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off. the fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up. couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it's a real challenge. maybe dirt devil thinks we have eyes on our toes. hey dirt devil here is an idea. how about putting the on/off switch on the push handle. what a novel idea. doh! 4. the vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy. it has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose. the main reason being is that the hose it too short. it's like you are fighting the hose all the time. it gets tiring. 5. the detachable hose is really hard to re-install in it's port. you have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat. 6. the vacuum is terrible on rugs on any of the floor height settings. it bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby. my old vac was not much better but at least with the old one i could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it wouldn't get all caught up. i tried the same thing with the dirt devil and forget about it. it jammed up every time. 7. the vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors. it just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back. i have to use the hose attachment. 8. the vacuum is horrible on steps. with my old vac i could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position. easy deal. the dirt devil does not work that way. when the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good. the only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted. one little problem with that. the weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking. you don't get a good positive suction. so you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal. the problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position. it often locks and so then you have to try and un-lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth. it's a joke. the only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush. the only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt. if you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops. now for pros: 1. the vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean. it has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up. it almost makes my carpet look like new and i do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister. some vacuums like to just tear up carpets. 2. the rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding. all in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed. i may just have to donate this thing and buy something else. i can't imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies. maybe i'll be lucky and the motor will die soon. then i'll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than dirt devil. steve ",negative

" we have owned this machine for a little over two years. for the first 6 months it worked as expected with clothes coming out slightly damp due to the condensation method of drying. however since then it has stopped drying such that 5 hours of drying (yes 5 hours) yields wet clothes. this has persisted despite 4 repairs replacing almost every part on the machine except the control board which i assume is next. prior to this machine we owned an equator brand washer/dryer combo which was a disaster: that broke after 3 years. unfortunately the lg is probably the best of a bunch of mediocre machines (equator asko maber and other brands) available in the us..all have shortcomings as dryers as all use the ventless-condensation method which take much longer to dry and almost all are 115v. the bosch combos available in europe but unfortunately not available in the us are 220v and thus dry more quickly. this is not a machine for a family but rather ideal for an apartment or condo for 1 or 2 people at most. when it worked it worked well. however no one should invest $1300 to have it break in such a short time. and no one should have to spend over 5 hours to do 1 load of laundry. if you must purchase one of these machines (for reasons of space) buy an extended warranty ",negative

" we bought a well-reviewed carpet vacuum from amazon last year and absolutely love it. after that positive experience we were looking for something for our kitchen bathroom and hallway floors and came upon this cleaner. starting with the dry vac part that seems to get smallish pieces of dirt fine but anything cheerio sized or larger it pushes around on the floor unless you lean the vacuum back. which would be fine but if you lean it back too far there is a suction filter thing (made for the wet vac part) that sticks and you have to turn off the vacuum and wait about 10 seconds for the suction to release that piece before you can continue. anyway the small dirt and dust are really picked up quite well but if any of you have small children (we have 3 boys under 6) don't have any expectations of this getting up mealtime messes. now onto the wet vac part which was the main reason we got this. very disappointing. we used the included cleaner warm tap water etc as the directions indicated and both my wife and i swear the floor is no cleaner than when we started. it doesn't look cleaner shine more or even have a nice smell that we could even close our eyes and pretend it was clean. spills or stains that normally take 1-3 passes with a mop are taking 8-12 passes with this machine. we bought this to save time and/or get cleaner floors and i can honestly say that this machine did not do either. as briefly noted above if you have children do not expect clean floors out of this and i can't recommend this at all. this product may be suitable for people who have no children no pets and only small dust particles and light traffic; i just know this isn't our house ",negative

" i am not a coffee connoisseur so my criteria for a good coffee maker is probably modest. i bought the ka javastudio because i own several ka appliances and have always been pleased. although the ka 10-cup is pricey i felt that buying a thermal carafe represented an upgrade from my previous glass carafe. i also figured that the wide spray mechanism might mean a richer cup of coffee. i did as much research as i could reading reviews and looking at available coffee makers in my area. after trying out our new ka yesterday my husband and i were both disappointed in its functionality and performance. here are some points to consider about this product: 1. the ka 10-cup makes 4 1/4 oz cups. in other words if you're looking for 8 ounce servings the most this will make is about 5 real cups of coffee. 2. the thermal carafe is heavy. if you're planning on keeping this on your counter - and possibly under a cabinet it is a tug to pull it out each time you use it to pour water in the back. 3. there is no way to figure out the water level in the tank. the directions say to use the optional white water filter insert. 4. for us at least taste-wise there is no discernible difference between what the ka brewed and what we've tolerated with our old coffee maker. good luck with your search for a more perfect coffee maker.

" while cute this little pan is difficult to use. there's no room to use a spatula so you'd better like the eggs cooked through - you can't flip for over easy and the egg white is too deep to do sunny-side up. also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip so you have to use a potholder. plus it's so small that it won't fit any normal-sized burner - another burn risk to your fingers ",negative

" to us typical fiestaware pieces have great design color durability and functioning wrapped up all-in-one. we ordered a set of turquoise candlesticks and were disappointed because the candlestick openings are very disparate in size and shape and it was obvious if one chose to use candles it would be a task to insert them properly with &quot;straight candle&quot; results. even more disappointing was the quality of the color application to the product. specifically the lack of even color application to the scrollwork and edges of the bases plus around the edges of the openings for the candles. we were sent a replacement set which had even more color variation but the openings for the candles were shaped somewhat better. we are returning both sets because they are not pleasing to view due to the shaping and color variations. fiestaware can have a color variation that is subtle and uniform a kind of &quot;softer&quot; look in the color application around the rims on plates for example and the piece will still look beautiful. we don't want to pay for a product that is not as pleasing to the eye as the rest of our fiestaware products far exceed the quality of these pieces ",negative

" this is a great idea but i think it might need more tweaking. the reservoir holds a lot of water which is good but there is no filter. so any cat hair stray food or whatever your 18-month-old might be trying to throw will end up in the bowl. then it sits there usually after sinking to the bottom until you dig it out. also with mine at least you had to fiddle with it and fiddle with it to get any real bubbles to appear. a shame since the cat really did like the few bubbles i was able to coax out. if this somehow filtered the water and made bubbles i'd be all over it (like cat hair on a pastel couch) ",negative
" i bought this unit because the humidity in my apartment on extremely dry days and nights was 15-20%. the air-o-swiss 7135 was rated top by every web site i visisted and researced before buying this product. it is also rated to work in rooms up to 600 square feet and the biggest room in my apartment is less than 500. well to summerize: - hygrostat consistently says 25% even though my bedside hygo says 15%. the best i can get out of this machine is 30% humidity according to my own hygostat as the one built into the unit does not move past 25%. - the above situation is in the smallest room in my home which is 170 square feet so the 600 square feet rating is totally not true. to close please be ware that this unit does not work for extremely dry apartments and homes like mine. the other reviews must be in homes that are already at 30-40% humidity. this is not worth the money you pay for it. i will try running it non-stop for a few days to see if it helps but if not then this unti will be going back.

" i have several other pieces in this collection which i absolutely love. when i was able to find the salad server set at amazon.com for a cheaper price i couldn't wait to order it. when it came i was more than disappointed. the set looked like it had either been 100 years old and was all tarnished (which it is not supposed to ever do) or someone had bought it tried to clean it with a polish (again something that is not supposed to be done) and it wore away the finish. i also bought the medium size bowl to go with the salad server set and when that came it was all scratched! needless to say i returned both for a full refund immediately. obviously the cheaper price meant cheaper quality in this case...and it wasn't dirt cheap to begin with i still had paid $75.00 for it compared to $150.00 that it is sold in stores for ",negative

" i was so excited to receive such a beautiful pan for xmas. however if my experience today is representative of how this pan performs i won't be using it often. the literature which comes with the pan describes it as pre-seasoned and the recipe included instructs for the bread to be brushed with olive oil but mentions no prep for the pan except to heat it over low to medium heat. on the first try i had some cheese burn onto the pan and the bread seemed to cling stubbornly in spots though i was able to get it to release with a pancake turner. the scorched cheese was very difficult to scrub off even with soaking for awhile. on the second try i oiled the pan and the press and carefully oiled the bread so as to not have any bare spots. i still had sticking! ditto for clean up. this thing weighs a ton too. it is awkward to transfer off the burner; the instructions warn lift do not slide on a glass top stove. i think i'll continue to use my non-stick griddle with a cast iron pan on top for a press. that always works great!

" we bought the petsafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much. it is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 maltese. this particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it won't work. unfortunately because it's rigid it slides up a dog's neck very easily. i have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it can't slide. even when i can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position. a shrug a shake or simply walking a few steps is all it takes. this is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs is not going to work. it should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member this is not a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems. the dog now has another negative association to the person. consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying. f. quall ",negative

" this waterer is a great concept but does have some drawbacks. for starters one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work. the first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it. the other dog is just fine with it but then again he's deaf so the gurgle doesn't bother him. lol. the other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls it gets dirty. so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl but it's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off clean the bowl and but the jug back on. so if your dog isn't afraid of the noise it makes and you don't mind the extra hassle cleaning it it's great. otherwise just get a large bowl; that's what i ended up having to do ",negative
" disappointing at best i was truly disappointed in this item. after purchasing it we followed the directions for conditioning the non-stick grids both before using it for the first time as well as before each use as listed in the use and care guide. it sounds simple enough. wait for the green indicator light to come on add the batter close but do not latch the lid. the green light will go off when it comes back on the waffle is ready. the only problem is the waffles were burnt and were stuck to the lid as though glued in place with epoxy glue. the waffles ripped into pieces when trying to get them loose from the maker and they also tasted like burnt toast crusts. we said well ok maybe it just needs a couple of waffles cooked in it before they start to come out right. 7 sheets of waffles later they were still coming out as bad as the first. the price is great the design is nice the over all appearances are wonderful but it simply does not work at least not for us. i told my wife i would take it back to the store and exchange it. she said don't you dare bring another one of those things home with you. it's to bad too we both love waffles.

" i grind beans for my coffee every morning. i was using a krups grinder and decided to switch to this quieter grinder...sold the old grinder in a garage sale. i do regret buying this grinder. it is loud and takes 30 seconds to grind instead of 10. my main complaint is that it is messy. the grounds stick to the sides and bottom and i have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out. i am tempted to purchase another krups before i break this one by beating the grounds out of it. also coffee grounds are everywhere i always have to use a cloth to clean up. not a good buy ",negative

" we purchased this machine for our small coffee shop 2 months ago as in the discription it was said to be for light commercial use. we make probably 20-30 cups of coffee a day. our problems began the first week after receiving it. the machine makes great froth for cappuccinoes but if you want to have steamed milk instead of frothed it either comes out of luke warm temperature allthough the setting is on high temperature or if you put the dial almost on the line between latte and cappuccino it gives you too much foam which lattes shouldn't have. so customers complain about their lattes being either too cool or too foamy. we called the manufacturer's customer service and were rudely brushed off. for a small business like us it is hard to close for 2-3 weeks to send the machine for temperature adjustment service so we had to deal with it. another problem came up 3-4 weeks later when the machine started shutting off by itself in the middle of steaming/frothing cycle or frother cleaning cycle. sometimes we had to restart it up to 5 times to make 1 cup of hot chocolate just to steam milk. at the customer service we were told to reset the computer by unplugging the machine for a couple of hours which we did. it did not shut off for 1 day! the next day the problem started again... i perform every neccessary cleaning or maintenance procedure that machine prompts and cappuccino cleaning daily so you can not say that the machine is being neglected. we are very disappointed with this machine. for the price that you pay you would think that at least customer service would be polite understanding and helpful. now we are looking for another machine a back up one to be able to send impressa z5 for service..

" i picked up a dozen in home depot for less than $5. same concept just a lot cheaper! two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen. the hole they make depends upon the weight of what they're holding. i'm sure it's pinhole sized if you're hanging something that weighs a few ounces (in which case you don't need this - use a pushpin!) the holes from the shelf are bigger than pin-sized but it is a heavy shelf. the hole is still way smaller than the hole i'd make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf. it also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks (the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang.) this is a small detail but if you need two of these things and you don't do it right your object is gonna be crooked. but on the bright side you won't have a huge hole to patch when you redo it! recommended product (but look around for the knockoffs.

" the kitchenaid kfpw760 is exactly as advertised. it has three nested work bowls. the inner smallest one takes a special blade (a smaller version of the standard processor blade). it's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things. pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something. the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest 12 cup bowl. a number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box (finally a way to keep everything together). the unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl. it's the kind with the rotating hub (two hub sizes are included one for lemons and a larger one for oranges etc). while it seems to work it's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the black & decker but what the heck it's worth trying. the motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it. at first i was disappointed that there weren't any fancy front panel switch options but after thinking about it you only need the provided on off and pulse. would i buy it again? absolutely. would i buy it again from amazon? again absolutely. the transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised ",positive
" i have the black fusion in my home office (which is next to a basement-level theater room) and my wife and i already love this machine. we have tried all sorts of mixes and we've only scratched the surface of what this machine can do. this is one of the first times i've been so impressed with a product that i wanted to write a review for it. physical properties: it handles travel mugs (if you remove the drip tray which is largely unneeded anyway) and all our standard mugs. the drink head moves up and down so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks (more common with frothy drinks than coffee and tea). when it brews a filterpack it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out (and thus keep it from dripping as you remove it). the water tank could be larger (if only because we're so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long) but if you have a ready source of water nearby it shouldn't be a problem. the tank fits better and slides on easier than the senseo (which we also have). flavor-wise: it's made by m&m/mars so you can bet that the sweeter drinks (the so-called indulgence fare) is excellent. coffee blends are quite good especially the darker roasts like french roast and sumatra. lattes made with espresso roast taste similar to starbucks moreso than other chains. clean-up: wipe the inside of the drink head and possibly the front of the plastic column (the colored portion) after any particularly splashy drinks. no need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug. of course you can't watch its magic when the drink head is that low so your first few times you'll probably get a drip here and there. final bits: we've had the senseo since its launch. between pods that need pre-wetting to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not-so-great varieties of drinks the senseo is lagging behind the flavia. we drink coffee tea espresso drinks mixed blends and sweet-tooth-friendly indulgence mixes every day with the flavia and it's brain-dead-easy to use. certainly easier to clean up after too! if you're on the fence between the flavia and other single-cup offerings (like senseo) get the flavia. keurig and other single-cup offerings can't touch the variety of drinks you can make with the flavia. i'm sipping a lemon/blueberry tea blend now made over ice and it's fantastic. highly recommended ",positive

" we have owned other hoover steam cleaners. they did a terrific job but all ended up leaking. we purchased a bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet. we bought the hoover f5914-900 based on the reviews. i was confident that it wouldn't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in america. i was confident it would be a better product and hoover had gotten their act together. we have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack. i couldn't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when i knew hoover could do just as good a job. ok...our hoover came. my husband put it together and it leaked all over. i then re-read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them. by then we had already taken it to the repair center. after a week they had not touched it. my husband picked the machine up and brought it home. we decided to start from square one and put it together again. he did following the directions to the letter. lo and behold...no leaks!!!!! yeah! my carpets are beautifully clean and i am a very happy woman. so...the moral to this story is always read the directions first ",positive

" like many people i have ignorant neighbors that allow their yappy mutt to bark on and on and on. despite talking to the neighbor politely and such they still have no concern for the noise pollution. i was losing sleep and the barking was getting so bad that i even considered moving! in desperation we looked online for something to stop barking dogs. we came across viatek's super bark stop and decided to risk the money. wow talk about being worth the money! my husband affixed the device on a piece of wood and staked it about 5 feet high in our back yard. it's unsightly yes but we're the only ones to really see it. more importantly it's right in line with the barking mutt. the first time he tested it he told me the dog about jumped out of its skin! we laughed gleefully. could a good night's sleep actually be on the horizon...? it's been several days and super bark stop has worked amazingly. the dog will lie as far as it can away from the device...when it usually lay in the middle of the neighbor's yard. if it starts to yelp a little it stops almost immediately. it's as if it's afraid to bark. yay! you can select the volume tone and number of barks to help eliminate false activation (say from talking or loud bird squawking). audible and inaudible both work fine but we now keep it on inaudible at the two bark setting. the device is waterproof plastic and you need 4 d batteries (not included) to operate it. i am so thankful we found super bark stop! my nerves were really getting jangled and i was dreading early mornings when they put the mutt outside. it's amazing at how inconsiderate neighbors are; just because you may want a dog doesn't mean i want saddled with its noise while you neglect it! p.s. after using bark stop for 2 weeks (yes it did work!) we noticed that the neighbors dog started to bark a bit more. (not as bad as before though.) we had it on silent and realized that it had stopped working. apparently it's not 100% waterproof despite the claims of the manufacturer. the person i bought it from said that once it's opened we find that it's not 100% waterproof. well guess what? you gotta open it to put the batteries in it! either buy a faux bird house to protect bark stop or house it where it won't get wet. otherwise you may find yourself in the same position we were in. we got a refund and fortunately for us our neighbors got rid of their dog...so we didn't bother getting a new one ",positive
" they really do work as advertised. they go right into drywall (be careful not to hit a stud however!) with no muss and no fuss. i haven't tested them on their claim of support up to 150 pounds but for basic home picture hanging etc. they really do work as advertised ",positive
" after reading every review on deep fryers i could find i finally decided on this one. it has been great and i couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use. i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors. it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great. we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes! my family only tolerates fish so this was greatly appreciated. cleanup is easy also. after waiting for the oil to cool the pan lid and rack can go into the dishwasher. only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy. the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be. i would recommend this with no caveats ",positive

" my golden retriever has had ear infections since she was 8 weeks old. over the years we have tried allergy shots dietary changes and prescription ointments - all costing a fortune. we tried zymox and it is absolutely fantastic. her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment. the itching and head shaking stop immediately after application and if i treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears i can keep her clear. this stuff is great and at 1/2 the price of prescription and no vet charges i'm happy to keep it on hand ",positive
" i actually purchased this book light so that i can read while i wait for my child to sleep. he likes me to be in the room. this was perfect. does not put out enough light to bother my son but allows me to do something other than stare at the clock while i wait for him to fall asleep ",positive
" this is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone. i am not in the habit of writing reviews but this juicer earns it. perhaps you are like me and have never used a juicer before. you want to get one without taking out a small loan because you just don't know if your that into it. if so this is your juicer. there are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting. i just want to back those up with my experience. this is a good strong product ",positive
" this is a significant improvement over the 750 model. the 750 model was not very well designed. the first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic. we returned this. we got the 760 to replace that. the 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem. for the same price as the 750 the 760 comes with one extra bowl juicer and egg whisk. compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed.

" i bought one of these for my girlfriend... then read the reviews! in my opinion it appears to work fairly well. the sensitivity switch needs to be adjusted depending on personal usage. to the far left seems to work best for 'normal' walking. as i said in terms of accuracy i think it's pretty good. the radio portion of the unit is reason for the '4 out of 5' stars. the sound is tinny; it's not stereo; there's no frequency disply; and the 'super-mini' plug forbids you from using a better set of headphones (earbuds) because the actual plug is too small to accomodate the standard plug size! though overall when comparing price to features... this little fella will probably suit your needs. if you already have a walkman (or don't care about audio) the unit with the calorie counter would be a better bet ",positive

" my 13-year-old cat was limping for a few days off and on and my vet said it was probably arthritis. a friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog nutramax cosequin had helped him and i already knew that regular cosequin has helped me with my arthritis so i bought a box of nutramax cosequin for cats from my vet for my kitty to try. it really made a difference! he stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake. he was so happy and so was i. on my vet's recommendation i continued giving him one tuna-flavored capsule each day sprinkled over his food as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication. i would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis; and buying it from amazon saved me about 2/3 of the cost from the vet.

" i have used this vacuum only on carpet as i bought it for my finished basement. suction is very powerful it is quiet and the dirt cup is so easy to empty. the cup is designed so that you push a lever and it empties from the bottom - very clever and so easy and clean. it is a large dirt cup so it holds a lot. other nice features include a very long cord and great looks! the most important thing is suction and this baby is powerful!! it's amazing what this thing picks up. overall extremely pleased with this vacuum! ",positive
" my only complant is that the cord is shorter then i am used to. but i guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind. this feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly. it sucks great is easy to clean and light weight. the price is fantastic ",positive
" we bought our french skillet two years ago and it has yet to even have one scratch on the cooking surface. it can go in the dishwasher and although we usually hand wash it it is nice to know that easy clean up is possible. it gets used in our house every day and is very durable. i am planning on purchasing more for my family! we also have a covered pan and a six inch pan that we use almost as much. in my opinion you won't be disappointed in this pan ",positive
" none of the other nonsticks can hold a candle to this stuff! i bought this and the 8 fry pan 2 months ago and except for the bottoms still looks brand new despite being used nearly every day. i even used a bacon press (cast iron) in it every time i cooked bacon and a couple of times i accidently scraped the inside side of the pan with no marks left. hubby stacked knives and forks inside then topped it off with 6 dinner plates. i thought it was done for--scratches and nicks everywhere but no not a single mark. my calphalon commercial nonstick (which hit the trash already) looked like it had been through a war when my 18 yr. old did that. i must admit though that i do not use metal utensils in it nor do i put in a dishwasher since i won't have one til the kitchen is remodeled. overall though just from what abuse it has gotten i'm very impressed and will buy more. my advice? don't mess with the rest--buy the best and this is it. going to try the wok next. wish they sold an electric griddle with this stuff in it ",positive
" i ordered 6 thinking i was getting 6 washcloths. little did i know that they were two to a package and i got 12. what a special surprise. these are the thickest washcloths i have ever had including those i paid a bundle for at exclusive stores. i am so happy with them every time i use them. they have never faded or left lint. thanks for a wonderful product ",positive
" this is probably one of the best blade grinders out there. the top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup eliminating the scoop step. it has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate along with cup amounts. the amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on however. anyways bottom line: it grinds great with little mess.

" my mother had a set of franciscan apple dinnerware as i was growing up though i never thought too much about what i was eating off of at the time. later as a wife and mother myself i was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen. we had just moved to appleton wi (16 years ago) so i decided to use an &quot;apple&quot; theme w/o even connecting the idea with my mom's dishes. i was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the franciscan dishes. over the years i've collected innumerable apple items but my goal is to have a set of franciscan apple dishes of my own! they do chip but they last forever and retain their color beautifully ",positive

" this is an excellent product. if you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium and making huge messes walking in puddles etc..and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks this product is for you. don't waste your money on cheap suction devices and buy the python today! (sorry if i sound like an infomercial i'm just an enthusiastic user). the python attaches to your faucet you turn the water on full blast stick the suction tube end into your tank and you can drain your tank in minutes or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes. then you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up (again in minutes). i have 2 29 nine gallons and a 10 gallon as well as a 15 gallon turtle tank and what used to take me a whole day now takes about an hour (to do all tanks). i like that i can vacuum the gravel boy does this thing suck the waste up. this will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great! i was skeptical that this product would work but am so glad that i bought it. now i actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it. the directions are easy to follow~ even for people like me who are direction impaired.

" i had a small version of salad shooter it was great used it for so many years but now the blade was dull and i kind have to push the veggy into the machine to be cut them. i decided the next salad shooter i buy should be slightly larger. so i bought this salad shooter professional series which is great having some features that are so important in a kitchen where cooking takes place almost every day: multiple cones to change large feeding place for the veggy fast light eassy to clean including in the dishwasherstill small enough to store in small spacesefortless to cut and shread your veggy no need for knife and cutting board. what i like the most about this product is the fact that when i put veggy in it to be cut shread... the machine almost vaccum them in to be cut so i do not have to push it in probable du to sharp blades an fast speed of rotation of the blades. this way your work is done in no time. in my oppinion it is a tool you must have in the kitchen.

" i bought this grill after reading reviews for many different grills i thought this one seemed to have the better reviews so i bought it. i really love it. it heats up pretty quickly and has enough space for 2-3 people 4 people would have to eat slower but it does have enough broiler space and its square to have people at all 4 sides. we use it 2 time a month at least and makes a great fast meal. the only thing that causes some distress is that the grill is not quite as easzy to clean as they say. most of it comes off very easily but some spots of cooked grease remain it comes of with some elbow grease and a scrubby but it would be nice if it was as easy as they said it was ",positive

" having bought the no name preseasoned cast iron pans vs this need to be seasoned cast iron pan as the tittle says: pay the 3-4 dollar difference and get it preseasoned instead. i'm using the preseasoned more because it is just ready. keep in mind its large and heavy. careful in your sink. coming from stainless steel and converted over to calphalon ( mostly bought all pieces from amazon.com ) if you are use to quick clean up and lighter cookware this is harder to convert over for me. heat kills everything. if you can accept the fact you are not literally washing everything off if you follow the hot water / salt / scrubbing.. and rubbing a paper towel on the pan comes off dark then you can get some amazing steady heat to sear with. but we all pay for convience and these pans i use mostly to sear meat. with a perference to wash and dry quick in our hurried lives get the preseasoned.

" recently purchased this in mid-2006 and it is the best cookware item i have ever owned and used. as one of those millions who rely on mid-line priced discount department store brands i can state with 100% certainty i was amazed (and still am) with the high-performance this item offers! the clean-up is still a dream-come-true all i have to do is get it in the sink and with a very very small amount of liquid dish detergent clean and rinse it practically cleans itself. my burners are all equal size (gas stove) and highest setting is 6 i have learned all i have to do for pancakes is level 3!! cooking bacon an entire pound is no problem for this cookware. i do want to purchase more of this item there is a smaller griddle version of this item also available. i'm even thinking of slowly switching to this brand all-clad nonstick ",positive
" i am a contractor and when i recently remodeled doug and susans basement i was eventually shown how to use the grinder to make espresso while on breaks. unfortunately i started taking lots of breaks... good espresso! the grinder is quiet preciseand efficient like an excellent sub contractor or a good table saw! the grinder was great. i use a burr grinder at my house but you can't even talk over the thing. this one whirs below a conversation level then stores the suberbly consistant ground coffee. i then pull the lever a couple times to dispense premeasured amounts into the doser that is resting in its holder on the machine and there it is break is on!! thanks for the good times and good espresso. on my way to hawk some of my tools to buy one of these things it's worth it ",positive

" this is a great cookie sheet. i chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum and because i know it's durable. my mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago and when i compared the two mine was much heavier and better quality. i would highly recommend this pan - especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and i was able to get 2 of these along with 2 of the 9 round cake pans from this company for only $30! a great deal ",positive

" i've already reviewed the miele vacuum cleaner itself along with the turbo brush so i'm a fan of the pricy-but-worth-it-if-you-can-afford-it sucker. if you're reading this you're probably one too so i'm not gonna talk about the vacuum cleaner on a net page selling the bags. i'm just going to relate information on the box about what miele vacuums this goes with on the theory that's the main question you have. it's not entertaining but perhaps it's useful: s241 - s256 i s290 - s291 s300 i - s399 s500 - s578 s700 - s758 s4000 - s4999 the box comes with 5 bags (they;re strong i've discovered) 1 dust compartment filter and one super air clean filter. miele uses a hepa filter known for its allegy protection. long-lasting worth it ",positive
" we bought this topper to replace a worn out topper of a different brand that after 2+ years was no longer bouncing back into shape. this serta topper is just fine as comfortable as our last one. my big complaint is that someone at serta (though serta isn't the actual manufacturer) needs to measure a queen sized bed because this topper falls about an inch short on all 4 sides. if you place the topper in the included protective cover it's several inches short on all 4 sides. i know 1 inch sounds minor but if you're a stomach sleeper and tall enough where your feet hook off the end of the bed the topper doesn't protect you feet from the stiff edge of the mattress. as far as toppers in general we have found that a huge advantage is the how much they help isolate movement across the bed. you don't feel your partner moving around nearly as much with a topper (though presumably with a full tempur bed isolates even more). definitely choose a topper with the highest density you can afford and the thickest you can afford ",positive

" i've been a chef for almost 15 years and a knife is one of the tools i reach out most of the time. during those years i've used all kinds of brands including kershaw wusthof mundial and even smart and final brand. and to be more specific an 8 inch chef's knife is my favorite. after having fun with these toys i thought it's time to reward myself with an ultimate gift. so i sought after a kind of blade that could be totally distinctive. one day i came across the shun classic on the amazon web. this knife sets itself apart from the others: the simplicity in design the beauty of the blade the sharpness and finally its steel quality. the blade has some kind of a pattern as a result from layers of steel which is said to be the same steel that is used to make a samurai's sword wow! the d shaped handle is made of dark coated hardwood it fits in my hand nicely. but the most stunning thing of all is the sharpness. i can slice pieces of lemons micro thin! it's not only super sharp but it also holds the edge sharpness much longer than other steels i experienced with. it weighs a little heavier but i'm sure that's not a big deal for me. cleaning up the knife after use is a breeze because there isn't any corner which will accumulate grease. shun 8 inch classic is the best i've ever had. you won't regret what you pay for even though the price is very high. a good chef deserves a good steel.

" after reading the other reviews i almost reconsidered my purchase. however the juicer works great - as long as you follow a few tips. 1) make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on tight! check once then check again. 2) don't use the paper filters particularly if you are juicing in quantity. once i threw mine in the trash the balancing issues went away immediately. it makes clean up a little harder but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use it's not a big deal. 3) if the item being juiced won't go through be patient and pulse-push it in. don't cram it with the pusher. my only concern is that when you juice quantities so much pulp sticks to the side it's hard for all of the juice out to strain out. it's best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice. using the above tips - i expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time ",positive

" we were very skeptical. one of our cats would mark certain spots (like corners) occassionaly. but we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room! it got so bad that we had to discard the rug. we tried boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day but the one time we forgot to spray he would mark again. we were at our wits end and decided to try feliway. we bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots. at first we also used the boundary but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we didn't see any urine markings anymore. it took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work. our cat even appears more calm and pleasant. we make sure that we replace the container of feliway every 5 weeks or so. it's well worth the money ",positive
" pros: i have two chocolate labs therefore i have a lot of hair to deal with. the vacuum works great and really takes care of the hair and dirt (wood floors). it works alright on rugs. cons: not cheap. loud. the plastic clip used to connect the strap to the vacuum comes out so you can't carry it you just have to roll it instead. not a big deal ",positive

" we recently moved and our two cats were having a few anxiety issues while adjusting to the new apartment. one cat usually friendly and playful would hide anytime a new person came into the apartment. the other cat usually very docile was being overly aggressive during play time with the other cat and with us. after buying the comfort zone plug-in we noticed a gradual change in their behavior over about a week. both cats seemed more relaxed and their behavior was more normal - more friendly and playful less anxious and aggressive. the only reason not to give 5 stars is because the description says one plug-in vial will last 4 weeks but the vial was nearly empty after only 2 weeks and completely empty after 3. but maybe there was more in the diffuser even though the vial had no liquid left. it is hard to judge when the plug-in actually ran out because the cats' behavior did not change even after i unplugged the diffuser ",positive
" having used hoover products in a commercial environment for many years i have had great service from them providing many years of dependable and powerful operation. we were excited to try out this new hoover model. one of the first things i have noticed about it over the previous windtunnel model is that it is heavier when you release the handle to vacuum. this may bother some but i see it as a testament to it's improved build quality over the gen.1 windtunnel. this machine is very powerful and it's dual turbine motor has a confident sound. i'll be curious to see how reliable the cord rewinder is. it is a nice feature though. i'll post back after the machine has had more use to see how reliable it is. **update** after having spent some time and use with this machine here are my experiences... two very glaring problems with the machine are that it 1) lacks a bag full indicator. the bag filled on this machine and then busted (unknowlingly) at the top around the bag collar. stuff went all over the inside of the bag chamber and sucked into the motor filter. it took another vacuum to clean the mess up. in the future i will be more attune to the sound of the vacuum and the weight of the handle indicating how full the bag is getting. 2) the cord rewinder is a nice feature but truly lacks quality. it will not hold the cord unless it is placed in the cord keeper on the back of the machine and also fails to fully rewind without assistance. a stronger recoil spring would really make a positive difference. 3) dust and dirt get lodged under the pulley guard on the main vacuum head not that it presents a problem but it's unsightly and the bottom plate must be removed from the machine to clean out the dust. beyond these minor issues the machine continues to perform well and without problems or breakdowns. ",positive
" i do most of the vacuuming. my wife's only request when i went looking for a new model was that it use a bag. she absolutely hates the bagless models and doesn't want to see what we're pulling up. we have two dogs (an akita and a golden retriever) to contend with and during shedding season the vacuum is running at the very least once a day. so after searching i find this model. i researched it to death and just as my wife was ready to kill me i take the plunge and order it from amazon. now the order status said it would take 12 days to get here and i was shocked when it arrived in 4. the big thing i like about this unit is that the bags it uses (although a little hard to find)have a handle on the top that seals up the dirt as you remove it from the machine so you never have to see or touch the dirt. the unit is a little heavy but moves around quite well. and boy does it clean! our rugs look fantastic! one complaint i have about it is that when you bring the unit into the full upright position the beater bar shuts off. another would be that you cannot turn the vacuum on unless its in the full upright position..i know its a safety feature..i just don't like it. the pickup tube is built into the handle and when fully extended is great for cleaning the blinds and ceiling fan blades. the little power head unit was great for getting the dog hair off of the curtains and the side of the sofas. overall i would buy this unit again and my experience with buying a high ticket item from amazon was so positive that i've purchased other items and make it my first place to look now ",positive
" i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas. i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use. some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans. maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them. the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly. i feel we made a good choice ",positive

" i bought this when my air popper died & i am so glad i found this product! the popcorn is the best & it is very simple to make. the thing i like the best is that it is a healthy alternative to the chemically filled microwave popcorn. i can choose which oil to use & how much so i have total control over what goes into my popcorn so i feel confident that what i am eating is good for me. the packaged corn that came with was ok & a good introduction to using the popper but i will not buy packages again as it is so easy to make a great tasting popcorn on my own. i did try the cinnamon popcorn recipe from the included book & it was fantastic! i would recommend this to anyone the popper is easy to handle easy to clean & it makes the best crisp & crunchy popcorn ever. it only takes about 3 minutes to be done & you can even use the stirring mechanism to stir extra butter in it or other salt or other seasonings. sometimes simple & old fashioned is better & that is the case with this item. now we can't wait to rent a movie so we have an excuse to pop popcorn almost every night!

" great honing steel that is a bit longer than others i looked at (seems to help a bit for the bigger knives) and an attractive taper (not sure that matters but it looks nice). i've only had it a brief time though i've used it frequently. despite an occasional clumsy collision this steel slides smoothly and shows no nicks. it straightens the edge on my (mostly) mid-grade knives with ease. another reviewer claimed the handle was plastic. perhaps he was mistaken or perhaps he had a different version. but mine purchased later has a visible grain if you look close under a dark ebony finish. it does almost feel plastic due to the hard resin finish but it is the same material as on the shun knives a friend has (though the steel lacks the metal endcap that her knives have). aesthetics are open to debate but i think it looks much nicer than most and performs better than any other i've used for daily straightening. for less frequent light sharpening i recommend a diamond steel. global makes the best diamond steel i've seen but i've stuck with the dmt for a quarter the price ",positive

" this delonghi bar32 espresso maker is the only budget priced espresso maker that i can find that does not have aluminum its water/coffee path. the boiler porta-filter & baskets brew group and steam wand are all stainless steel (albeit the wand has a plastic tip). i thought the capressopro with a slightly larger stainless boiler might qualify as aluminum free and provide good competition but the porta-filter itself is made of aluminum (although it does have stainless basket inserts) and is twice the price than the delonghi bar32. it is questionable that the acidic coffee might poor over onto the aluminum porta filter and leach aluminum at the bottom of the porta-filter after exiting the stainless baskets - although capresso implies no in their ads.

" this is probably my favorite mug. it easily holds about twice as much as a regular coffee cup. it comes with a plastic splash guard that locks into place down inside the rim. the best thing about the mug though is the wide grippy bottom that enables me to set it just about anywhere in my car without worrying that it will tip over. even hard corners don't seem to phase it. it's also the only cup in my house that can withstand my cat's efforts to tip it over. the odd shape also has downsides though. it won't fit in any cup holder i've ever come across but that doesn't matter much since it won't tip over no matter where you set it. if you don't rinse it out immediately it can be difficult to clean later due to the shape; if you don't have small hands you may need a bottle cleaning brush. also i imagine if you had more than one of these mugs they'd be awkward to store since this mug tends to hog the cabinet space. despite this it's still a great mug. in fact i'm going to need another since my husband has now adopted it as his favorite too ",positive
" i was looking for something small to put near our litterpan since the cats track the clay out of the box when exiting. i found this vacuum at a fair price and decided to give it a try. it does a perfect job! i owned the original model when it first came out years ago. this one is more streamlined and improved. the dustbuster is the right choice for little cleanups.

" i searched for months for a stylish durable set of flatware at a bargain price and this is it! i was lucky enough to buy service for 8 at half price during a friday sale. the design is unique and contemporary and the finish and weight are of excellent quality. the only criticism that i have is that there is a big size difference between the soup spoons and dessert spoons - the handles of the dessert spoons are a bit too short for my taste and tend to get caught in the flatware rack in my dishwasher. however this is a very small price to pay for such a gorgeous inexpensive set of flatware that will surely last for many years to come.

" have owned this product five weeks and used it several times to cook hamburgers london broil steaks. it produces excellent results and is relatively easy to use. the cooking grate can only be set at two levels: standing on its posts or inverted lying on the rim of the firebox. the level must be chosen before you start cooking which presents a problem for some preparations. the damper seems to have little effect on cooking temperature. emptying ash is a bit awkward as you need to remove the doors and coal grate then lift and tip the firebox which is heavy. the lip catches some ash so it is difficult to completely empty. be sure to set the grill on a pan as grease will leak through and collect around the legs ",positive
" i see a lot of people have leaky shakers. not me. mine is absolutely perfect. the top/strainer piece fits snugly leak-free requiring just the right amount of effort to de-couple it from the canister. the design of the canister lip also makes it easy to attach the top to the canister. the lip on some shakers makes it hard to attach the top. the cap/jigger also fits perfectly with just the right amount of snugness that it stays attached but also comes off easily ",positive

" after much research and consideration i decided to buy this product as a christmas gift for my husband. i am not the type of person to research products before i buy them but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso (and being cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth--makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines) i did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations. i have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it. my main concern was how hot the coffee would be and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee. i've read reviews about the noise it makes and after having the deloghi product the noise this machine makes when warming up is not that loud at all. we are very happy with it. buy it you'll be happy too ",positive

" not many people can rationalize spending twenty dollars on a pizza cutter but i previously worked at a pizzeria and often make gourmet pizzas at home. this cutter is sharp and rarely requires multiple cuts to slice through all of the crust. it is really useful on those thick pizzas like spinach and feta. plus it looks pretty cool hanging on the wall behind your cutting board. i almost never use it for any non-pizza cooking and a heavy sharp knife works almost as well. however it's a fun item and if you find yourself looking for a nice gift for somebody who makes a lot of pizza i definitely recommend it ",positive
" absolutely fab!!! shiny-bright stainless steel matches frieling french press and any other stainless tableware/countertop items perfectly! just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so...of course the sugar bowl holds plenty- note you'll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go-around at a table seating 4-6 coffee lovers. overall these are just very sturdy/solid clean-up beautifully and very easily and by the way the sugar spoon included with the lid-covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar and sets inside the little 'notched' area of the lower bowl so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered/on at the same time- a really simple yet european-engineered well-thought out design & quality. i fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me-down...although it's a l-o-o-o-ng time until i'll be distributing my assets! make sure to buy the matching frieling french press- it's just incredible & also heirloom quality! give yourself the gift of european quality coffeeware- it's one of life's simple yet indispensible indulgences! ps the frieling french coffee press w/ this matching sugar/creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too ",positive

" how did this technology elude me for so many years? after spending decades of trying to bring the butter up to room temp by variously taking it out hours before i needed to use it placing it on the warm radiator zapping it in the microwave or putting it in a dish of hot water finally i've found a way to keep the butter spreadable and fresh! few kitchen aids are as useful as this one. i would rank this up there in the top-ten list along with my 8 wusthof blade 3 chinatown-special drain mesh pyrex measuring cup and my zyliss salad spinner. i bought this particular model for my dad's birthday and both he and my mom love it. i have a similar version at home (clear see-through) and my girlfriend's parents have an earthen-ware version at home. they all work great. once you try this there's no way you're going to go back to the traditional butter dish ",positive

" i have some nice nonstick cookware that i needed whisks for so i got these. my main reasons for choosing them were the brand and the fact that someone in a review for another product said that these were all silicone rather than silicone coated steel. unfortunately that is not the case. this is silicone coating metal. this is acceptable though because the 5-year guarantee will cover the whisk should the silicone decide to peel off and 5 years of cookware-safe whisking for this price is worth it to me! the whisk is wonderful and i'd recommend it to anyone. just don't believe the reviews telling people to get this for the reason stated above ",positive
" the spatula is very good cooking in high temperatures on the stove. the food does not fall through the slots. it is so nice to not have the yoke broken when flipping the egg over when frying. it is good for dipping out food out of dishes also. the only thing was the loop on the end of the handle was broken when i received it. it didn't hurt the function of the spatula. it is a great tool to have in the kitchen ",positive
" i've seen this particular clock at other web sites. i decided to buy it from target.com because the price was good and there is free shipping. when i received the clock in only 3 days i was pleasantly surprised to see first how well it had been packed. it arrived in perfect condition. i inserted an aa battery only to wonder whether i had gotten a dud -- it didn't make any perceptible tick. soon it was clear that the clock was working well and i hung it in my newly remodelled kitchen in a prominent place and i love it. i highly recommend this very quiet well-made clock ",positive
" i live in sw florida. everything down here rusts even the nails in the walls. i am gradually replacing all my aluminum bakeware with stainless steel and have also been looking for stainless steak knives having already found several good stainless steel paring and carving knives. amazon has a deal i couldn't refuse. $90 steak knives for only $29.99. i bought two sets and i couldn't be happier. it will take some time to get used to their slim shape and lighter weight after using big clunky steakhouse-style wooden-handle knives for so many years. my husband might not be as enthusiastic as i am about the smaller knives but they are sharp and classy looking and they cut meat very well. i will keep a couple of clunky ones in a drawer just in case. some people want fancy boxes to keep theirs in and these come in an aluminum box with riveted corners and a fancy clasp but i don't keep my knives in boxes. no storage room. i have a lot of stainless steel german knives and i consider them to be the best. i have magnetized bars attached to the wall behind my stove and all my stainless knives are there handy and nice-looking. these will complete my collection of nice-looking knives on that wall handy where i can just reach up and grab them. you just can't beat the price but if you don't like them you can return them. amazon is the best place i have found to buy everything i need for my kitchen bar none. i will give these two shiny aluminum boxes to my grandchildren for their treasures ",positive
" after mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf with an interesting pattern on the crust. my first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly. it is much easier than hand shaping a loaf and much more rustic/natural than using a loaf pan. the natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the old-fashioned way. when it's done rising carefully remove it from the basket and care fully put it on a pre-heated bread stone in the oven. the loaves look and taste great ",positive
" nice compact size-can be moved easily. does freshen the air in the room noticeably. on whisper setting is almost silent. on turbo setting can be heard but in no way impinges on life maybe would sleeping. does shoot out air but does not blow with any force. over time like a day all the air in our 20'x20' living area changes. did have a noticeable plastic like new odor the first few days of use which wore off. haven't had any build up on the collection grid in these 2 weeks but it would be easy to clean.

" although it doesn't mention it these hepa replacement filters also fit the hamilton beach air cleaner model 04150. i had to email hamilton beach to find out but they were very helpful and responded right away. when the filters arrived from amazon i saw that on the box it says fits models 04160 04161 & 04150. with our cat and houseful of antiques we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around. i run this model in our office under the table which holds the computer. since placing it there i have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated. i placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job. the regular settings can be louder than expected but i leave them on the whisper quiet setting when we're in that room and i don't even notice them being on. i would definitley recommend the hamilton beach air cleaners ",positive

" cast iron pans are the way to go. no dangerous non-stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them. this one is probably the best i have ever owned. only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner. bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges. but for pancakes etc. this is perfect. get this one and a smaller 10 pan and you'll have bases covered.

" we had an ancient kitchen aid and i loved it... but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky. our daughter now has it and is happy with it. we bought the hamilton beach mixer and i like it almost as much as the kitchen aid. the best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up making things a bit easier. the only slight complaint i have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump... it's a little too fast for what i want most of the time. another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter ",positive

" i've been using spiegelau wine glasses for several years and they are excellent. the bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine. these glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine. (they're also not bad for rhones though i prefer the reidel vinum syrah glass.) if you drink a lot of burgundy or pinot noir or italian piedmont wines (barolo barbaresco langhe) i'd suggest spiegelau's burgundy glass. if your preference is zinfandel or chianti you're a bit out of luck with spiegelau however. their chianti glass isn't very good. try the riedel vinum chianti glass for these wines; you'll be knocked out by the way it focuses the bouquet. some reviewers have complained about breakage. i've seldom broken a glass but it does occasionally happen during washing. my method is to clear the sink run the water as hot as possible put a bit of dishsoap in each glass. i then use a special ultra soft brush (which i got at a local wine shop for about $6) to clean the glass removing fingerprints and especially the gunk around the rim. then rinse thoroughly with very hot water. invert on cloth. after about half an hour with the glasses almost dry you can wipe them off with paper towels (which don't leave any lint behind) and put them away. the main thing is never to lay them down in the sink and wash one glass at a time. just do the wine glasses and pay attention to what you're doing. don't try to stick your hand inside the bowl when drying; just use the paper towels. finally even though these glasses are supposed to be dishwasher safe i don't know why anybody who loves wine would put stemware in a dishwasher. dishwashers always leave a film and eventually their abrasive detergents will put microscopic scratches on the glasses which lose their clarity as a consequence ",positive

" my three cats adore this playpen. just moments after putting it on the floor they started playing with the tease. they also love snuggling in the bed together (2 cats fit at a time). my only complaint is that i can't find the replacement teases -- they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non-catnip styles. the manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and i can't find them at petco's online store. i would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find ",positive
" works great can use easily and waffles taste great! my kids could live on waffles if i would let them and this is an asset to have in any kitchen- makes extra light and fluffy waffles ",positive
" i just got this waffle maker and have already made a perfect batch of honey wheat blueberry waffles. i can't believe how easy it was and how fat and fluffy they came out. i used krusteez mix because i was out of eggs and used frozen blueberries. the mix told me to add a little oil for waffles. the booklet told me to plug it in and wait for the green light. i sprayed it with pam. i poured in 1/2 cup of the mix on each side added blueberries to the top closed it flipped it and that was it. the booklet says they are done when the steam stops. they were brown before the steam stopped so i pulled them out. no sticking no spills. i almost purchased an $80.00 model but decided to get this one after seeing all of the reviews. what a great deal ",positive

" i received this knife for christmas after reading the review in cook's illustrated magazine and then requesting it on my gift list! my son ordered it through amazon and it arrived before christmas. it is now my favorite knife and is used daily. after cutting veggies fish meats and fruit this knife continues to be extremely sharp well balanced and easy to use. what a great gift ",positive
" i bought one of these for my apartment and it's quite an investment considering the constant cost of refills. it does contain the odor better than a garbage can but does not completely eliminate it. the instructions seem a bit confusing at first but it's a piece of cake once you figure out what they are trying to show. with that in mind it's a step in the right direction and does a fair job of containing the odor (particularly for indoor environments) and is a better alternative than the hooded litterbox for kitty's respiratory system ",positive
" this lenox piece holds an extremely large quantity of soup or casserole. it is microwave and oven proof to 350 degrees so you can cook and serve in the same beautiful casserole/soup tureen. handles are sturdy but short so they are hard to grip with a cloth pot holder but easy to grip with bare hands. because of this feature you may decide to use this as a serving dish only. good for a large group rather than due to large capacity. we are a family of 2 so we would prefer a smaller casserole from lenox ",positive
" i've been using these for a couple of months and every nasty gloppy mess i throw in it including shortening butter cream cheese sour cream and others have slid right out and cleaned up perfectly fine. i spend less time cleaning up then i would have with glass as more is pushed out. i haven't had any problems with them sticking and have yet to find a complaint with one and have gone so far as to aquire a 1 cup version. they both sit out and are never put away as my glass measuring cups are ",positive

" unique looking with the soft polypropylene body contrasting with the chrome; distinctive and attractive for an item that sits in plain view in the kitchen all the time. with normal bread in before lowering the bread sticks almost 1/2 way out of the toaster making it very easy to remove hot toast to toast smaller items (the plunger will go up even further to assist); the slots are extra wide so although i have not used the sandwich cage accessory i can see how there is enough room to make a sandwich and toast it in the cage (apparently a british idea and maybe something worth investigating). i am doing normal toast on only setting 2 bagels on 3 and with the separate bagel feature they come out perfect! (bagel feature: push a button on the end of the darkness knob so that the heating elements change their normal output to get the bagels just right). the machine feels solid as if it will last a long time. the cobalt blue color is more of a bluish-purple in normal light but very attractive. very happy with the machine (the vendor that sent ours had it to us inside 48 hours with normal shipping!

" after reading reviews on the wok's available on amazon[.com] i decided on this wok due to the ability to put it in the dishwasher. turns out it is a bit to large to put in my dishwasher but it is very easy to hand clean. the non-stick surface has lasted but i am careful to only use plasic or wood and i wash it with a cloth and soap. it gets to temperature quickly during cooking the only 'complaint' i have is the simmer cycles (not a constant heat but on and off). i purchased some thai cook books (real thai and thailand the beautiful cook book) and was amazed with the correct ingredients and a wok how easy it is to prepare my favorite food. the difference the wok made- i was able to cook at the correct temperatures. my stove btu is apparently quite low it took forever to 'sizzle' so the food turned to mush before it was cooked. i now use the wok for anything i want to cook fast and/or warm up ",positive

" glasses focus aromas well and provide a nice counter-point to reidel. anyone who worries about lead content need not because there is very little free lead in a glass and none is water soliable ",positive
" yes it is made to be a decanter for half bottles but yes it does easily hold a full bottle. what i use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner. so i decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed. if you use it in the same manner you do not have to worry about the size (but again it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact). i also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table and guests love it ",positive

" this krups toaster is the best i have ever used! perfect toast every time. the wide slots center bagels properly and you have the option to toast the cut side only or both sides. the lift function eliminates trying to fish out small pieces with a fork or knife. the defrost function works great. if large bread slices dont fit properly horizontally they will fit vertically as the toaster is deep enough to handle these large slices. the crumb tray slides out easily eliminating the usual mess in cleaning out a toaster. all in all the best toaster i have ever owned ",positive
" i was going to buy the lello 45900 ariete espresso/cappuccino maker because the price was so good but i waited over three months because it was not in stock so i looked for a replacement and this machine was more than twice the price but after using it it's more than twice the machine i think on the amazon description it says the pump is a 16-bar pump but after checking reviews on different web sites i think amazon made a mistake because on all the other web sites it says the a pump to be 17.5 bar pump that's even better and the other thing that i like was the fact that it had a cd that was not said on the description either i never use a espresso machine before so seeing a short little videos was very helpful shows and explains the basics from making espresso two frothing the milk cleaning tips and more very helpful . so i made myself my first shot of espresso it was great nice little cream on top it just looked beautiful i didn't think it would work to good because i bought some pods and i wasn't sure how it would work works great taste great and easy to clean second day i made myself a latte again excellent. third day i got adventurous i made myself my first cappuccino and again great put starbucks to shame. the espresso i was using was the illy sucro espresso pods 906 naturally the espresso you use is actually more important than the machine i guess this one taste great about different type of syrups caramel vanilla hazelnuts irish cream the syrups brand was davinci so yes i am very satisfied with this machine and i guess i got lucky because this one was out of stock for a long time ",positive

" cuts like a samurai blade quality and doesn't need to steel as frequent as the henckels/ wusthof knives. it has excellent weight for a medium sized hand. however the handles get quite slippery when wet so keep your hands clean and dry while using this knife for safety. also if you plan on saving money on getting a cheaper steel don't because this global blade is much harder than the henckels/wusthof blades; a qood quality diamond coated or ceramic steel is a must or if you really like the steel design get the global steel which can cost quite a bit. overall this is a good quality knife with proper care and attention needed just like a samurai would do to get use to his sword ",positive

" we are using 2 love seat throws for an old l-shaped sectional sofa. it really transformed the green plaid sofa into a nice burgundy color. the material quality is great for the price. the only drawback is the width of the throw just barely manages to go over the back of the sofa and it keeps slipping say about once a day. the throw is basically a rectangular piece of cloth with no in-built mechanisms to hold in place (e.g. a velcro system straps etc). so you have to put the throw over the sofa again neatly. if you don't mind arranging the throw about once a day this will be a very inexpensive and great looking cover for your sofa.

" about a month ago a friend gave me her gf tenth anniversary grill because she said she had no room for it in her kitchen. in return i grilled up some home-made sausage and veggies and had her and her family over for a great supper! i really love this grill. even though it's got a big surface area it's no trouble for me to either take it out or put it away and it cleans really easily. my tip for cleaning is to rub the grilling plates with damp paper towels while the grill is still fairly warm; the charred stuff wipes right off! i wish this large grill had interchangeable plates for griddling and making waffles like the smaller g5 version does. just imagine the big breakfasts you could serve up with this baby! i do suppose extra plates would make this grill too hard to manage though given its size. bottom line: i'd highly recommend this grill especially if you're using it for a family of four or more ",positive
" the refill accessory (in both 50 and 70 oz sizes) definitely cuts the refill-maintenance in half. since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often. you still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended. a different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher-safe and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual. throwing caution to the wind i ignored the warning and now have an oddly-shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected ",positive

" this was one pattern that both my wife and i could agree on. the design is clean and interesting and should fit with most decors. i purchased two of the 16 piece sets from amazon for $... set and with the free vegtable bowles no tax and free shipping this was by far the best deal on the internet. my first set arrived with two broken salad plates and one broken dinner plate. my second set arrived with one broken salad plate. the repacement set arrived with one broken salad plate. the vegtable bowles arrived intact. the quality seems to be first rate. no warped plates or design flaws but a few item did have some minor cosmetic flaws. amazon was great at resolving the damaged goods issues but needs to seriously rethink the packaging of fragile items. the only fault i could find with this set is that the soup bowles are a little on the small side. i recommend that you read and following the cleaning and maintenance directions and this set should give many years of service ",positive

" le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. the enameled cookware is cast from molten iron formed in sand moulds which are used only once. for this reason one pan may look like another but each is unique in its own way. cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently. for this reason it is recommended to use on low to medium heat. there are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay. otherwise cooking with high heat may cause food to stick discolor the enamel coating or cook the food unevenly. remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. this helps your food stay warm while serving. beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well. cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled you would have to season and maintain it. adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good but has multiple benefits. the enamel being a solid coating is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on does not stain absorb odors retain flavors and is easy to clean. the enamel can be damaged so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood. the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically. this pan holds 5 1/4 quarts of food measures 9 3/4 x 14 x 3 inches internally and weighs 10.2 pounds. 5 1/4 quarts will typically feed 8 - 10 people when it comes to casseroles so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. except for roasts the roasting pan tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot. i find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac-n-cheese while not so desirable for other dishes. add the le creuset 9 x 11 1/2 inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease. some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles pork chops covered with cornbread dressing dinner rolls baked squash lasagna scalloped potatoes cobblers pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding. the possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination. one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. heck cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products the cost tends to make sense. then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of. pros: extremely versatile efficient absorption and distribution of heat hygienic enamel cooking surface does not stain absorb odors or retain flavors easy to clean when not abused or misused can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table can easily last a lifetime cons: its heavy as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 10.2 pounds ",positive

" this is by far the best toaster we've ever owned. it does not have the thin metal elements that glow red like a conventional so i don't know how it works yet but it gets the toast perfectly brown on each side. a fan comes on and stays on to cool it down during and for a brief period after operation. the bagels we toasted in it were just perfect! the microwave is large enough inside for my purposes which are usually just reheating foods and defrosting. i never use microwave popcorn so i can't say how well it does in that area but the frozen burrito i cooked last night came out terrific. regarding the comment one reviewer said about it not being space saving i think what the company is referring to is the fact that while the unit itself might have somewhat of a large footprint it eliminates the need to have a separate toaster. this does indeed save space not to mention an electrical outlet. overall i'm very pleased with it but haven't had it long enough to speak to its longevity. i can tell you that it's almost worth buying for the toaster alone ",positive

" it's a three-piece roasting rack--two sides and a long pin that holds them together. when assembled it has a rounded bottom and tall sides with handles. it's supposed to handle up to a 25 lb turkey and after using it with a 22 lb turkey i believe that claim. the tall sides and handles make it easy to remove your turkey from your roasting pan and the wide rounded base holds the turkey nicely up out of the drippings without crushing the rib cage the way angled racks do. in fact my only beef with the shape was that it was too wide to fit in our maxam steel roaster which is currently my favorite roasting pan. the truly cool thing about this rack however isn't the handles or the shape. it's that nifty pin at the bottom. you see you just put your racked turkey down on its carving platter and pull the pin then you simply remove the sides. that's it. they pull right away from the turkey leaving it behind on its platter. no more trying to lever it out of your pan or off of its rack; it's right where you want it already. for all of its non-stick properties the rack did take some real elbow-grease to clean--particularly when trying to get turkey goo out of the crevices between bars--but that isn't very surprising. it does make it unfortunate that the dishwasher is not recommended for this product however. also there is one problem that did bother us; it seems that some of the non-stick coating at the bottom of the rack flaked off during cooking. we thought that perhaps the initial 30 minutes at 500 f was too high a temperature for the rack but there is no maximum temperature listed on the packaging that i could find. i'm still giving this item a rating of four because it's just so incredibly cool an idea and so remarkably useful but i have to admit that i'm not thrilled with the idea of a non-stick coating that flakes and i wish the item was dishwasher-safe. i'd love to see cuisipro develop a version of this item made out of a better material ",positive
" some reviews make it sounds like every ec701 is defective out of the box. so far i've made 40 shots of espresso and 10 steamed ciders and i've been very pleased with the product. i've been working on improving my technique and now i think the espresso is excellent. i prefer my homemade shots to the stuff i buy at starbucks and most other cafes though this could be due to delusional pride in my own amateur baristaship. also i may be over-excited because i'd wanted an espresso machine for so long. the negatives (so far) are that it looks like there are is a fair amount of ongoing maintenance cleaning of the machine though i doubt that this is unique to this brand. also as others have mentioned the espresso spout is low so i drink my coffee out of ceramic ramikins (although aren't low spouts authentic?). also i haven't gotten the steamer working quite right and i always end up with cappuccinos (all foam) even if i'm trying to make a latte. hopefully i'll get better with time. as for reliability i've only made 40 shots so i can't speak to the long-term quality but so far so good. and heck 40 espresso drinks at starbucks would've cost me over $120 by now although making it at home still isn't free -- if you use the convenient pods it's still about 50 cents a shot and illy beans are expensive (right now i'm using an unground dark-roasted kona which is deep and very smooth) ",positive
" it makes the cleanest and purest coffee i have ever tasted. i also use a moka pot a french press and a drip and only the press rivals the taste of this vacuum pot. to those who had failures and could not get it apart i have no idea what you are doing wrong there is little to go wrong. fill the lower pot put on the upper pot with grinds in it heat it watch the water infuse the grinds remove from heat and let it go back down. what is there to go wrong? if it fails to go back to the lower pot there must have been a vacuum leak pull it apart and let gravity do it or just stick something in it and dislodge the filter if you are in a hurry. there is no vacuum up top so how the coffee got stuck up there defeats all i know about physics just dump the stuff into the sink if it fails to go back through the filter; it is pretty simple. if it doesn't work for you i'd call it user error try again if you can boil water this should pose no problem i have used it 100s of times with not one failure ",positive

" i just received this griddle today and am so disappointed to find on the small print on the box (and not in amazon's description!) that this griddle can not be used on ceramic top stoves. it's a beautiful piece of cookware heavyweight and with grease pour spouts at the edges. exactly what i wanted but very unfortunate that amazon doesn't tell you that it won't work with some stoves. the warning on the box actually says that using this griddle on a ceramic stove can break the ceramic top. probably would have given it 5 stars if i could have used it ",positive
" many of you reading these reviews may be wondering how this compares to similar items made of cast iron. i can tell you that while it obviously isn't cast iron and for that reason alone many will say it is inferior it is still an excellent griddle. the bottom is very heavy and it conducts heat well. it fits perfectly over 2 burners on one side of my gas stove. i've cooked several sandwiches at once on it as well as pancakes and some eggs and the heat seems to distribute very evenly. i was very impressed with this aspect of the griddle as cast iron is known for its even heating and i was wondering how an aluminum griddle would hold up; it definitely does a fine job. the bonus of course is the nonstick surface and it's a good one not some chintzy teflon coating. good quality construction. the handles are solid and it doesn't feel cheap at all when you hold it. take care of this griddle (make sure it doesn't get scratched) and it will take care of you ",positive
" i have a manual sharpener but in reality almost never use it. the electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no-brainer. there's a coarse grinder for knives that are dull. for most knives the fine- and polishing-grinder works just great. if you have inexpensive knives the coarse grinder will chew them up but if you have well-made knives the waring will work well. i've had good success with the waring ",positive

" took the pan home and promptly fried a steak on high thereby causing an apartment full of smoke and a pile of burnt crud on the pan including a large stain seemingly impossible to get off. tried everything including the company's recommended bleach method. no luck! then i tried baking soda as suggested in one of the reviews here and it just simply wiped away the damage. like new!......then i set about reading the instruction booklet and have had great results using low heat. it's really a different way of cooking but the fried stuff comes out just as if i'd used high heat on another pan. stainless steel's great too of course but this is a worthy and earthy alternative. i take the perspective that the ceramic layer gives the pan a solid foundation for the seasoning process.

" we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years. they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine. i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together not just by the handle. fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand. (they are made like hotel china essentially. homer laughlin is a hotel china company in fact. the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line.) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style i can recommend the fiestaware jumbo cups. we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee but also for heating soup in the microwave. they are both great. never been disappointed with fiestaware ",positive

" we have owned the breadman corner bakery for about eight months now. it has made our house smell wonderful. i have to say i don't use the recipes that came with it so i won't judge those. for the price this is a beautiful machine. the pan has a solid heft to it not like some of the other bread makers with seemingly flimsy aluminum pans. we have made many types of bread in it and have even churned butter from heavy cream. the best kind of bread is the one made in the pan right after making butter. with a toddler and a baby it is nice not to have to run to the store everyday to buy fresh bread or rolls. the only time our bread has turned out not so good is when an ingredient has been forgotten. without the yeast it wasn't quiet the same but our house smelled great ",positive

" i bought a few of these collars out of desperation. in the past my cats got out of any kind of safety collar within an hour of putting them on. since i was moving recently i was especially afraid of the cats getting lost during the move or at our new home. i bought these collars because of the reviews and everything that the other reviewers say is true. the only thing i'll add is that one of my cats managed to chew through his collar over the course of several months but it's still the only kind i'll use for him. at this price i can easily afford replacements ",positive
" we had our kitchen gutted and completely redone. i built a knife holder to use in a drawer. now with the wusthof 25-slot i have removed my home-made holder. the drawer can be used to store other items. i can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years. there is no need to buy a lot of new knives. just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives. having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use. you can't go wrong with this super storage block ",positive

" we bought this hand blender to get rid of the problems created by the power cord on our braun corded hand blender. the cuisinart took care of the problem. pros: very good power for blending good battery charge life easy to clean clever modular construction (battery separates from motor built-in plug and charger) does not roll off counter. cons: larger and heavier than the corder braun. this blender may be difficult to use for people with small hands. very short people may also find use difficult as the blender is over 16 long. the surface finish of the plastic housing is very smooth making clean-up easy. i don't recommend washing the blending head in the dishwasher as this smooth surface may be degraded over time. the heat of the dishwasher may also degrade the rubber seal around the blender shaft. hand washing is easy and quick. one reviewer suggested that cuisinart's recommendation of leaving the battery pack/charger assembly plugged in all the time was bad for nicad batteries. this may shorten the battery life but the charger charges them at a very slow rate; this protects the batteries from what really damages them: heat from fast charging. as the charger draws only 1 watt of current some may want to leave it plugged in continuously. current recommendations for care of nicad batteries is to run them down until they no longer supply useful power. don't run them down completely as was the practice in the past. the cuisinart batteries will charge fully overnight. they don't feel warm to the touch and this slow charging rate will extend their useful life ",positive

" i bought one of these in august of this year. i used it daily to make a ham/egg/cheese/english muffin sandwich every morning with great results. however after about a month the non-stick coating started to bubble then peel off from the egg poaching pan. i called back to basics and had a new pan free of charge within a few days. the new pan has been in use for two months without issue. the people at back to basics were very kind and shipped my new pan without hassle. some people reviewing this product have complained about the stainless steel water boiler becoming dirty from minerals and scalded meat juice. others have complained about the egg being soaked in water from steaming and/or sticking in the pan. i have overcome these problems by doing the following: i bought a gallon of distilled water that i use in the water compartment (at an ounce or two per use a gallon will last a long time). this prevents any mineral buildup and keeps the cooking cycle time to a minimum (keeping the stainless steel clean keeps heat transfer to a maximum therefore speeding cooking time). every three or four uses i wipe the water compartment with a damp paper towel to remove any accumulated debris that may have dripped down. after cooking everything i remove the egg poaching tray and while holding the egg in the tray with a plastic fork tip it on its side over the sink to drain off any accumulated water then remove the egg with the plastic fork. i use store-brand spray oil and have never had an egg 'stick' in the pan. i have found that if i want toast/an english muffin/a bagel to be pretty crispy i have to run it for two toaster cycles. all in all this is a great product. butter consumption in my house has decreased dramatically and i'm not making a huge buttery mess on the stove every morning. plus there no dirty spatula and frying pan to deal with every day.

" these cups are high quality stainless steel. don't worry about putting thorugh the dishwasher or leaving in a sink. i was surprised by their weight and long handles. my old measuring cups were of much thinner steel and over time this lead to dents and deformation of the cups. these miu cups are extremely sturdy. the handles on my old cups were more typical too while these miu cups all have very long handles(~4.5). at first i didn't like the asthestics of the handles nor the fact that the smaller ones don't stand up on their own due to the imbalance this creates. however when i needed to scoop something out of a small-mouthed container i quickly reversed my opinion of these handles. cricisms: the interior has perpendicular corners. i prefer a slightly rounded interior corner for ease of cleaning and emptying. still it doesn't make much of a difference. also while they're not hard to store they don't stack all that well so they'll probably take up more room in your drawer unless you have tall drawers(~5.5). i suppose because they were designed for cooking utility over storage ease. (...) for the 5 cups i'm extremely satisfied. i feel these are top of the line. the 7 cup set is overpriced (...) so definitely go with these. i don't understand why you would throw them away becuase you wanted the 2/3 and 3/4 cups? just use the 1/3 cup twice or the 1/4 three times...or eyeball the 1 cup.

" this pan is a good buy and a wonderful size for 2-3 member families. although not as heavy as some of the french copper pans i have many of the commercial calphalon pieces and love the handle. the pan is definately heavier than cheap quality pans and the stainless interior is just what i wanted for acidic based cooking (tomato sauces etc). as far as scratches well what do you expect? if you use it it is going to get some scratches... the brushed exterior helps hide some of the outside marks though. some have complained about &quot;scratches&quot; on the other calphalon hard anodized but most of the time they really aren't scratches but rather aluminum marks from the rivets when stacking. in any case they are easily removed with scotchbrite and some cleaner! enjoy! p.s. i chose the &quot;no shipping cost&quot; delivery and received the pan in just 4 days!

" i bought one of these from a yard sale for use at my small office. i was getting stuck cleaning up the kitchen and decided to see if this little unit was worth it. i'd looked at the small haier unit and was not impressed with the plastic interior. i broke a lot of rules setting this up. its not connected to the hot water supply since i have a very old sink and the only other connection i had was to cold water lines. also the machine is on the floor under the sink. i bought new hoses to make the connections. luckily the standard connectors on the back made this easy - the fill is a standard clothes washer fill line and the drain can take a piece of garden hose. i was concerned with the garden hose holding up to very hot wash drain water but so far its been okay. (if i was installing this anyplace else or using this in my home i might not be so nonchalant.) my unit was used from an area where there was very hard water and the previous owners had never cleaned the innards of the machine. i soaked everything in clr to remove the scale from the sump grill the heating element and the wash arm and cleaned the gunk out from under the door seal and away we went. since we are in an office we always use the sanitary wash to keep the cooties down. the machine does an excellent job of getting even cold tapwater super hot and the dishes will flash dry after the cycle is over if you pop the door open. the machine has no problem pumping wastewater through the drain line and up 3 feet into the sink. one reason i avoided the plastic tub haier is noise. if you load this machine carefully you can prevent items from clinking against each other too much and the machine will operate more quietly. we've found that we can run the machine have the office radio on and still comfortably make phone calls without much trouble. my only complaints would be that on occasion the timer has gotten stuck (once or twice in 100 washes). also some plastic items have been slightly warped by the heater. capacity is very decent probably because the machine is pretty large. measure first ",positive

" i purchased this fan for my teenage son who like the drone of a fan to sleep. i have since purchased another one to put at the top of my stairs to help circulate the air from the downstairs since we have no ceiling fans. my son loves how much air this baby pumps out and the steady hum has been a wonderful plus saying he hasn't slept this good in a long time. the 2nd fan has done wonders for the house circulation and i too have come to enjoy sleeping with it on in my bedroom. very sturdy steel construction easy assembly of the legs. 3 speeds. top speed is out of this world. almost like a wind storm. me and my boys actually ripped up tissue paper and had a ball putting it in front of the fan and watching them swirl all over the house. what a riot! i highly recommend this fan for excellent air circulation sleep aid and some silly fun ",positive
" i have used patton air circulators for the last twenty years and if you are looking for something much more effecient than the common box fan that you see in department stores this is really a fan. the first one i bought had the c.f.m. rating on it which was 9600----they don't put that on the fan anymore but it is a three speed fan that will really circulate some air and can be adjusted to blow straight up. nothing i have seen even comes close for the money--- ",positive
" apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new s5 series of miele vacuum cleaners the features price and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models nor even across series. many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones. they have fancy names like capricorn red velvet and champagne leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car. if your browser has tabbed browsing (e.g. firefox) the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to miele's website and open a tab for each model you're interested in. flip back and forth to see what text changes. callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series (newest technology motor?) that still comes with an electronically powered brush (the 4th pisces model is turbo). after 3 months of extensive use: pros: agility - the 10  wide seb217-3 electric powerbrush comes standard and one of the reasons i chose this model. for me smaller is better. while other vacuums advertise large 13 power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe i don't have much open carpet space. coffee tables chairs weight benches and computers all need vacuuming around and under. the powerbrush swivels well to get around corners. brush duster - the most commonly used attachment (for me) the brush duster is also small (slightly larger in diameter than the hose) and the bristles are durable. it's angled by default but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out. this is not mentioned anywhere; you just have to figure this out for yourself. on low power i was able to vacuum places that never got vacuumed before like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires. i even vacuumed the telephone itself and other dust collecting objects on my desk. parquet floor brush - initially i wondered why miele would include this accessory when the powerbrush was included but this wider brush duster actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush. the powerbrush seems more designed to churn up stuff from carpets but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust stuck to hard surfaces better. on the negative side you might have to vacuum the brush itself to unstuck the dust and i wondered why they had to inconvenience the horse for genuine horse bristles. there is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush so you have to figure out how to ensure the parts don't get separated for life (the powerbrush takes precedence). cord rewind - the mechanical rewind sucked in the entire length of cord every single time something like 15 for 15 times! (the manual says to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat.) cons: price - after all it's just a vacuum cleaner. there also seems to be price fixing in the newer s5 series at least when i bought this. everywhere i checked (maybe 10 websites) the price was exactly $799 or $799.95 with the only difference being no tax and/or free shipping. one website even advertised the lowest price allowed! what's a diamond dealer? is this amway? release buttons - the release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive being on the part that comes off rather than on the part that stays behind. therefore you must squeeze the button with the same hand you are pulling away with. the hose extension button is particularly confusing. it's an oval shaped rocker button that rocks very little. to extend the stainless steel hose you have to remember which side of the button (top or bottom) to press. there is no distinction on which side to press and it's always a matter of trial and error as i yank and tug at the hose while pressing top and bottom of the extension button. stiff no swivel hose - the hose rotates at the top (handle area) but does not swivel at the base where it connects to the machine. instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists i'd rather pick up the powerhead and spin it around to get out the twists. the flex hose diameter is larger than i'm used to making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet where i used to store my old vacuum cleaner. considering the price an electrical slip ring would have been nice. bag full indicator - the mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck. put your hand over the end to block suction and it will indicate bag full. right out of the box on short carpet it indicated bag full on high power. as i turned the power down it indicated less full sequentially. you have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor to get an accurate reading from the indicator. even at that there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair that can fool the indicator. extra stuff? - the parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose (button doesn't easily click into place). the extension isn't needed to connect the parquet brush so you have to remove it and keep track of where you put it. to this day i still haven't figured out what the extension is for other than to connect other attachments that i might buy in the future. this is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that i must ensure does not get separated for life (along with the parquet brush normal filter cage and replacement bags). symbol marking - the power symbol markings are not obvious at all contrary to claims. other than the symbols labels min and max you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean. at least the power seems to increase sequentially as you turn the dial clockwise. the quite mode is #4 of 6 settings (with 6 being the highest) and is therefore not actually the quietest but intended to be the normal operating mode. i think most people will consider max the default mode. optional filter frame - this model comes with a hepa filter so you don't need the filter frame unless you're going to switch to the normal filters but brand-new right out of the box the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle apparently due to the way it was shipped with the handle protruding out the cardboard wrapping. you don't even need the handle for the frame to function properly but for the kind of money i paid nothing should be broken out of the box. the vendor that i bought it from (best vacuum) replaced it for free. so is it worth $800? it does a good job but only time will tell.. ",positive
" they aren't kidding--this thing is razor-sharp. it needed no tuning up before i used it for the first time. the handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight... which is unfortunate because i like the weight for chopping. but the hollow-edge design is wonderful--the mushrooms and onions i sliced up were thin as paper and didn't stick to the blade. i'd recommend it ",positive
" the cheaper ones don't quite fit... unfortunate because these are so expensive... which is why i gave it 3 stars instead of 5 stars... i would give five for the product but the price really is outrageous... they know choice is limited so they gouge their own customers (hamilton beach not amazon)... too bad the makers of these machines don't have the users in mind instead of their bank accounts... they take advantage of people who need these humidifiers ",positive

" i destroy cooking pots. i'm especially lethal to the light-weight teflon lined variety you'll find at the supermarket. my secret is simple: i like to cook on high heat and i get easily distracted. that guarantees that i'll forget what's on the stove and produce a scorched (and warped) utensil. if a lightweight teflon pot lasts me two years it's extraordinarily lucky. i now own four (different) swiss diamond pots. and even my brutal habits leave them unimpressed. despite regular disasters they seem to shrug off what would vanquish a lesser pot. (admittedly i do avoid metal spoons and spatulas and clean them with non-abrasive means.) they have excellent non-stick characteristics superb heat-spreading and -- love it -- are approved for very hot oven use. adding up to essential cooking tools! and when you factor the price of regularly replacing cheaper pots their cost becomes more than bearable. highly recommended ",positive

" i had a pampered chef sprayer that i loved but it got clogged and stopped working after 2 or 3 years. i should have tried harder to find a pampered chef rep to buy another one the pampered chef one works better than this one. however this is not a horrible product. one drawback compared to the pampered chef one is that you can't see through this one to see how high the oil level is. you want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway and when it is less than 1/3 full you need to fill it back up or it won't work as well. this unit is even more finicky than the pampered chef one about the level it almost won't spray if the level is too low. but since you can't see through it even holding it up to the light you have to look down in and estimate how high it is. the reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is. you don't want to fill it all the way up either. then you need to pump it more than the pampered chef one needed to be pumped. this one sprays a very fine spray finer than the pampered chef one. and it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there. i think i know why my old one got clogged. so i'm trying something new: each time i'm done before i put it away i twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure. i think if you leave it pressured up all the time like i did with my old one it damages the nozzle over time. but time will tell if i'm right. another tip -- don't fill it with anything but olive oil. other oils evaporate and leave a sticky/greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer. you know what i mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it. olive oil doesn't do that that's why i now don't use anything else on my stovetop (except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying). this type of sprayer will work much better if you just use olive oil in it trust me. but if you have a choice go find a pampered chef rep and by their sprayer. it's cheaper and better quality ",positive
" i spray my foods with olive oil using this wonderful sprayer. it's great to use if you want to avoid the unhealthy chemicals you get in the spray cans off the shelf. just poor in your favourite olive oil ",positive

" as a le creuset cast iron fan it was only natural that one day i would try out their stoneware products. while maintaining the same color options and increasing their product offerings i still prefer the cast iron products over the stoneware. even so there are times when the stoneware fits a need the cast iron cannot effectively fulfill. the stoneware is not intended for use on the stovetop. besides this the stoneware can go from the oven/microwave to the table and then to the refrigerator. virtually non-porous le creuset's stoneware is fired at 2156 degrees making it resistant to chipping cracking and staining. the enameling results in an easy to clean and scratch resistant surface and will not absorb odors or flavors and resists moisture absorption. this line is sure to perform for many years. the stoneware line has many of the same qualities the cast iron line is known for. this pie dish can be used for ice-cream pies crisps cobblers pies shepard's pie tamale pie or any other number of dishes. pros: fits a need le creuset's cast iron line sometimes cannot same high quality standards found in le creuset's cast iron line but lighter weight made to last for many years cons: not intended for use on the stoveto ",positive

" my pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind. he jumps to pull the beas out of the hive. he squeaks the beas. perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head. he went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it. it is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads. he likes the wing detail for chewing on. this toy gives exercise. i am so glad i tried it. he plays with the hegehog on his own. those are the 2 best toys. the squirels from the hide a squirel are fun but the game holder is not something he was really excited about. these interactive toys are great. i have never seen such excitement and tail wagging. he hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise. this one is the best. it is well worth $10 for a dog who loves to play. i get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys ",positive

" this stone is very functional -- works well and goes from oven to table because of its beauty. if you've never cooked on stone before prepare to be amazed. it's a must for bread baking to develop a nice bottom crust. i also use the stone for baking french fries and other stuff. just put the pan directly on the stone and your food will be done faster. with use your stone will discolor. this happens with any stone. you also should not wash any stone with soap. use hot water and a plastic scraper to clean. this is the only all clad product i have that i can't get the stainless to sparkle like new. i think it's because i left it in the oven so much. the pizza cutter that comes with this is the best i've ever used. because of its size this product is great as a bake-and-serve/occasional baking stone. if you bake a ton i suggest getting a larger stone and just leaving it the oven all the time ",positive
" i see all the reviews agree - it is loud - but i love it. i was able to sleep with it on hi speed - but can see how it would disturb some people. it is very powerful - great for the bedroom - i often wake up hot or cold in the middle of the night - the four speeds & remote control are very convenient.

" i only gave this product 4 stars because my daughter hasn't slept in it yet. but i set it up and it was super easy almost one touch set up. it is firm yet comfortable and the super soft fleece cover is awesome. it has moons and stars on it. the take down was 5 minutes if that. it's small enough to fit almost anywhere and deep enough so that a toddler (my daughter is 2) will not roll off). love it and i know i will be using it often.

" this fan is an excellent value for its price. it gives 3 options for style of air flow nd 3 speeds. additionally it is easy to move the head up and down so that you can either just circulate the air or actually have the air blow at body level. i bought this fan because my old one had died in the middle of a hot summer. this one filled the bill and is effective in a small to medium sized room. the only reason that i did not give this fan a rating of 5 is because it has begun to hesitate when it swings to the right. this has happened to other similar fans i have had but not so soon after purchase. if you're mechanical you can probably correct the problem by yourself. i do recommend this fan for anyone and any place. oh did i say the remote is perfect??? because i am handicapped it saves me from getting up and down too often ",positive
" this swissmar fondue set is excellent. i love how stylish it is. i looked on amazon and other sites looking for a flexible fondue set that could do: - cheeses - broths for meat - chocolate flexibility is what i was looking for. the 3 in 1 is perfect for doing cheese to start with when done with that course remove the ceramic bowl pour the water out of the copper pot and put in your broth. although i haven't used it for chocolate yet i'm sure it will work well for that. using this setup for cheese is better than ones that have the burner directly heating the bottom of the bowl instead of water between the pot and bowl which more evenly distributes the heat. others tend to burn on the bottom unless you constantly stir. of course if you're into the tradition of swiss fondue cooking the thick part in the bottom is the tasty part for your special guest! the burner is hot enough to keep your broth simmering unlike another i have used. also it holds enough fuel to keep things going throughout that course. you will need to refill it between cheese and broth - of course make sure it's extinguished and cool before doing so. i used bottled gel purchased from a local cooking store. an excellent purchase - i am very happy with it.

" after using my roomba for a year and loving it i decided to splurge and buy scooba. wow! i think i love it even more than my roomba! i turn it loose in my large kitchen every couple days and go upstairs and forget about it. when i return i have a gorgeous shiny clean-smelling floor. once a week i wrap a damp washcloth around my swiffer mop and go around the edges or my kitchen and deep in the corners--but the rest of the floor is spotless and shiny all the time. scooba is a miracle. i did have a little bit of fussing with it right out of the box. i had to prime the pump to get it going. my only suggestion to irobot is to go ahead and include the instructions on priming scooba in the box instead of making people go to the irobot website to troubleshoot. obviously from reading the reviews you ought to expect that the customer will have that problem. fortunately that's the only trouble i've ever had with it! i've never had to prime again and it works flawlessly. i'm very impressed with scooba ",positive
" i internet shopped for a week reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made. i decided on this one based on my research and i am glad i did. i make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast easy job. ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly. it is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power. i also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal the pitcher is thick solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless. i like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2 yes just 2 speeds. i find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons. the fact that the hamilton beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the moroccan red is gorgeous.

" i must admit i'm really surprised at just how great this little stick vacuum is. only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is it's still too early as i've only had it for a month or so and things may change quickly considering the amount of use it's been given. we have two seaside vacation rental cottages along with our own home and have been using this vacuum in all three places at least twice a week. along with the normal amount of dirt and dust we also have the sand factor to deal with and so far there has been no problem. i highly recommend this little guy and in fact may get two more to put into the cottages instead of carting this one all over the place. one suggestion though. wonder how long it'll be before someone comes up with a combination of corded and cordless model. that way it could be constantly recharging when using it in the electric mode.

" my son who lives in washington uses these fans exclusively for air conditioning his house in the summer. we live in california but bought this fan to help vent our computer room which gets way too hot in the summer despite air conditioning. because it either brings air in or vents air out and is thermostatically controlled it works great. we plan on buying 3 more next summer to keep our air conditioning bill down.

" about a year ago i was looking for an espresso/cappuccino machine that would be both great in quality and easy to use. i also wanted it to look contemporary to fit the style of other things in the house. on the other hand i didn't want to spend a fortune for some expensive brands that run up to $12000. at that moment i was lucky enough to order from amazon breville 800jexl juice fountain elite. that juicer impressed me so much that i was happy to buy breville's whatever - which happened to be breville 800esxl die-cast espresso machine. it is reasonably priced for style and quality and so far i my husband and all our guests are happy with both espresso and cappuccino. i only wish i could do more than 2 cups at the same time. a year later i still think it was a great buy and it works as well as ever ",positive

" the english take their toast seriously and while i don't share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast i lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at williams-sonoma for years. about seven years ago when the dollar was still strong versus the british pound i bought the 2+2 combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the uk for about $100 less than the then-going us price. while it's a bit dicey fitting thick-cut bagels into the slots (not a big bread item in the uk) i solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them. the toasting is even and i actually the enjoy the old-fashioned timer without pop-up which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled. unlike others i do not unplug it after each use. never had a problem. the crumb tray is terrific and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess. i've had the $100 krups and cuisinart models which burned out within two years. this one is made for restaurant use and i expect it to last a lifetime. worth every penny if you appreciate high-end kitchen appliances and tools ",positive

" i wanted a dual coffee/espresso maker thinking i would mostly drink regular coffee with the occasional latte indulgence but i was totally surprised how easy it is to use and now it's lattes every day. also there was almost no learning curve-- my first cup (surprisingly from what i've read elsewhere) was near perfect and apparently it wasn't a fluke. if there is any drawback it's only that there is no warming plate under the espresso carafe (but i'm sure a purist would scoff at such a notion). if i have one recommendation it is to spring for a stainless steel carafe (or whatever it's called) to steam your milk. i'm not a physicist so i'm not sure why but it does make a difference. in summation this is a great deal on an excellent delivery system for my drug of choice.

" after the handle broke off the carafe that came with our krups aromacontrol (after about 2 years of use perhaps several times a week) i found this one and ordered it. my belief is that cleaning the original carafe in a dishwasher is what caused the handle to come off however i am perturbed that i had to go to the trouble of replacing it. one would think the engineers would consider the heat of a dishwasher when choosing the plastic components. i am not entirely sure but it is possible that the plastic (abs?) became too brittle with oxidation and simply fractured. i searched on the internet and found this to be a very common problem which is at the same time comforting and annoying. upon receiving this carafe i was disappointed due to the lightweight feel of it. i prefer a certain heft and i assumed that the lack of this in the new unit means that it is cheaply made. however this has proved not to be the case; moreover the decreased weight is actually something of a blessing. further i think they removed some of the threads around the neck of the carafe (inside) on this model. the advantage of this is that the coffee pours better (a tighter stream not a wide cascading waterfall like the original carafe) however i it seems to make screwing the top on more difficult. in all it is superior to the original however i am not washing the carafe in the dishwasher for fear of the handle coming off. i assume that they have fixed this problem in this model however i cannot be sure of this. i also must say that it is a tad over-priced and that perhaps [...] might be a more reasonable price. the only reason i did not get a new coffee maker is that the aromacontrol works well and makes good coffee (i use illy) ",positive

" my kids have a restless reaction to foods that contain red dye 40. my wife and i limit their exposure when we can. an example is a particular fruit snack that did not contain this dye. recently they changed their ingredients and so we are left with no options on the snack isle. we figured we could entertain their cravings by making homemade fruit leathers. the ability to make jerky was a bonus for me. i ordered another brand that i thought was going to do the job but once it arrived i found the construction to be subpar and it was passive requiring rotation of the trays. i immediately sent it back to amazon. thats when i ordered this nesco unit. it is powerful and effective. i have used it a number of times and made some really good jerky and fruit leathers. i have tried a couple of the seasonings and absolutely love them. order this and you can't go wrong ",positive

" using a chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing and it requires a finer ground than what auto-drip machines ask for. after the water is brought to a boil it's important to wait for it to cool just slightly (about 30 seconds) and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter wait for them to drain and then fill the pot with water. want more than a single cup of coffee? you wait for your first pour to brew and then fill the filter again. some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing: 1. taste: i don't know how it does it but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter. 2. cleanability: users can keep all necessary components clean (anyone who's brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that wasn't there when you bought it understands this plight). oftentimes the most aggressive criticism of the chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it's not possible to get your hand into the reservoir. some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot but if you're like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass then you need some good 'ol fashion friction to get it clean. the best thing i've found: a baby bottle cleaner. it's narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls too. brilliant! 3. electricity free: as long as you can boil water you can have coffee. 4. mud/sludge: french press and stove-top espresso-style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee. don't get me wrong: i think that's good (i use a french press when i'm in the mood) but the cone on a chemex doesn't allow that at all. 5. style/size: the chemex coffee pot is a relic (designed in the 40s) and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it's a wonderful minimalist sight on any kitchen counter (and unlike electric coffee makers easy to move if you need the space). some drawbacks any purchaser should consider: 1. time: it does take 5 - 10 minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee. 2. cones: you can't run over to wal-mart when you use the last filter; you need to find a specialty store or go online which means you need to plan ahead. 3. cold coffee: no electric hot plate (thank god) means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly. you can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your chemex can be warmed on the stovetop. i think that's more labor added to an already laborious endeavor. just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee. 4. learning curve: it does take some time to get the grind right the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue. 5. cleanability: i know this is in the advantages column as well but it's worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things. to submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff (which is a small pain) else it will get nasty over time ",positive
" this set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces however once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware you'll want to buy more. over the years i have spent hundreds of dollars on another well-known commercial cookware brand but all-clad is far superior. the stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for. the handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well-balanced making them very easy to handle. they heat evenly and cook uniformly even over low and medium heat. i am very pleased with all-clad's performance on my radiant cooktop. i would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance. well worth every penny ",positive

" after 3 -1/2 years of pulling 4 to 8 shots of expresso per day and steaming hundreds of gallons of delicious foamy milk this little steam toy still works like new. better than new actually because it has a better operator. good results require a bit of experimentation with the variables of different grinds and quantities of coffee and durations of extraction. i've come home many times to discover that i'd left the electric switch on all day but not to fear the thing doesn't burn up so far. on other occasions i've overloaded the pump by letting the reservoir run dry and then adding water to try to resume extraction through a filter that had become clogged from the interruption of the flow of water. the pump keeps going even with the output blocked down to a trickle. this will happen to you from time to time because you will neglect to refill the reservoir. when it happens just start over with dry coffee. you will also need to buy a small diameter tamper - mine is 49mm. the expresso liquor always has crema and never tastes sour to me even when using cheap brands of dark roast like eight o clock and community coffee. everything i've said about the brilliance of this machine is contingent howver on the coffee grinder. without a good grinder you might as well just make drip coffee. the secret good expresso in my experience is 25% expresso machine and 75% grinder. a good grinder is the gaggia which i bought from amazon for $175 with a discount or the rancillio rocky which i would have gotten in the first place had i understood the importance of an excellent grinder. this machine is small and light enough to take with you to the motel when you're on a road trip and cheap enough to leave behind if you forget to put it in your car the next morning. my next expresso machine will be much more expensive but not because i'm trying to obtain a higher quality brew. my only reasons for paying more are to get double shots and the solenoid valve which will eliminate the spills of hot soupy grounds when emptying the porta-filter. also when you get familiar with the operation of a machine you'd like it to last so you don't have to learn a new set of techniques ",positive

" i've had a braun for 7 years which mysteriously developed a leak and was laid to rest. replaced it with a $20 mr. coffee 4 cup from walmart which eventually let water out the front the back the side etc... creating a puddle just like the leaky braun. threw that out and went to a 12 cup hamilton beach that i had received as a gift. what a pos... it had a bulky carafe that was difficult to clean and also the crap leaked as well and when i lifted it water fell out the body creating yet another puddle on the floor. after reading reviews on the net and countless hours of searching for a good price i was ready to buy the bunn stainless steel. i almost bought the bodum electric santos until i read that for some users the bottom carafe developed a leak and it needed to be modified so that the water heats to the correct temperature. anyway while at target i spent an hour looking at coffee makers including the bunn - which i really liked b/c it is made in the usa. i decided to buy this one just to test it out. i like the idea of having a removable water tank for cleaning (which the bunn does not ahve) and a timer which also the bunn does not have. the carafe is not bulky and has a no-drip mouth. also i have not seen any leaks so far but water drops onto the warmer when i remove the basket to discard the filter. perhaps i should just remove the filter and not the basket. the problem with most coffee makers is the steam. after it condenses the excess water has got no place to go other than hang around the basket or into the body. anyway i also like the cool blue light in the front and the coffee takes good - or as good as my braun which is what i've been used. overall i don't think it's bad for 40 bucks. if it develops a leak i'll go buy the bunn. if that also sucks i think i'll give up coffee for i've had enough trying to find a good easy no drip/leak (no punn intended) drip coffee maker.

" for $19.99 you'll not find many knife sets. i paid that for one kitchen aid santoku knife! this set includes a long slicer/utility knife one large paring knife and a 5 or 6 serrated knife. the knives consist of good steel comfortable grips and are well balanced. they are very sharp and sturdy. i couldn't find a better set for the price. i was looking for a decent utility/carving knife and a large paring knife when i found this set. i use mine as the disposable knives. for this price you won't have to worry about beating up on them. and they sharpen up quickly too. the red color is very festive. the grips feel like silicon so they work when wet and greasy. and pleasantly squish when you grip hard. if you are in the market for a fine high level kitchen knife these may not fit the bill. but if you are looking for good quality inexpensive knives you won't find better in this price range. i paid $19.99 dec-200 ",positive

" i bought this to hold some of my overflow knives that would not fit into my knife block. it has proven to be very handy. it seems well made im not expecting miracles from a knife tray so that doesnt really say a lot but it is sturdy and nice looking. it occupies about half of a drawer which leaves plenty of room for the rest of the non-sharp cooking utincils to sit next to it. i have now switched its intended purpose slightly insead of just holding the overflow from my counter top knife block this now holds my most commonly used knives. the real knife block now sits farther away in the corner occupying the overflow from this one ",positive
" i've had one of these in constant use for four years now and it fulfills its reason for being admirably. it is totally utilitarian and keeps my valued wusthof global and henckels knives organized out of sightprotected and instantly accessable without taking up the whole drawer or using up valuable counter space as larger 'made mostly for show' blocks would. if you're looking for something simple and in its own way elegant this should serve you well for a long time. if you have more knives than this will hold or if you have lots of counter space to waste get something larger. that's just my opinion. i could be wrong ",positive
" look. i suck at using a normal iron. but after reading some reviews decided to try a press out to decrease my dependence on dry cleaners. the results are pretty good. as i have gotten better using it the results have gotten better. plus there are some fabrics and materials that iron much easier than others. i just did a couple of long-sleeve dress shirts and the results were good. not perfect but good. as others have said i wish it were bigger and wish the top plate opened higher and with the back hinge was farther back to give me more room to work with. but once you understand the right method of doing it the back hinge isn't really a big deal. more height clearance would be nice though. it won't be too long before it pays for itself. and now i have no excuses when it comes to wearing clothes that are wrinkled! plus i'm pressing my golf shirts which typically didn't look that good after being washed but were too expensive to get dry cleaned... i also just ironed an undershirt just for fun. now that was an easy shirt to iron. : ",positive

" i was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum. wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction. it had some of the best section power i had seen in any vacuum. so i bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities. its so light...about nine pounds and easy to transport and store. its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button. the bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum. they are very easy to get at and change. its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors along baseboards and on stairways. not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch. i have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming. this is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright. my vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool. many third-party vacuum attachments would work with it too. i am glad i bought it and would recommend it. its the vacuum i would use most. the biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done. push a button and the cord automatically rewinds. whats not to like about this vacuum. highly recommended ",positive

" i don't know about the other reviews that say this knives aren't stainless steel the labels fall off or the filet knife breaks but what it's for sure in my case is that these knifes work great. i don't go by fanciness nor brandy items... i want knives that cut nice and easy and the miracle blade iii are the best. it's true if you love your things just follow what says in the instructions manual. don't dish wash your knives because in addition that they rust they start to reduce their original sharpness. even more any knife will reduce their original sharpness no matter what the manufacturer says. do not wash knives in the dishwasher or hand wash them with hot water. all of my knives preserve their labels and looks like new and i use them on a daily basis. once again it's a matter of following instructions. my filet knife is in perfect condition. common sense: don't do everything what the infomercial shows. don't bend the filet knife to verify that the guy on the infomercial's testimony is right. this knife cuts beautifully without too much bending. finally i own this set of knives for two years and a half and they still cut as good as the first day i received them by mail. i live in colombia south america where this product is not too cheap so i had to think several times before i decided to make the call. today after two years and a half i don't regret of making that call and i am very happy cooking with my miracle blade iii knife set. furthermore i do recommend this knife set to anyone.... just follow instructions that's all ",positive

" this is one of my most used knives in the kitchen. it's the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons. you'll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily. the blade keeps its edge for a long time but eventually you will have to sharpen it. i invested in a good coarse stone a good 1000 grit water stone and the $5 clamps you slip over your blade to keep the sharpening angle constant. good stones are expensive though. i think it's worth it for such a fine knife ",positive

" i loved my 8 inch global chef knife so much i ordered this veggie knife. oh wow this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies. it also fits in your hand extremely well. if you are going to cut up a potato it is hard to beat the chef's knife. however for cutting up a tomato carrot etc. this thing is the best tool i have ever used. just wonderful ",positive

" as i tend to nurse a cup of tea at the office for a while i decided to purchase this product this after looking around for a good desktop electric mug warmer to use with a standard ceramic mug. such a product just doesn't seem to exist; check the amazon customer ratings. i had one a number of years ago and it was lousy (had hoped that someone had built a better mousetrap but no one has!) i purchased this mug just about a month ago. it's so good i had to share the secret and even if an improved electric warmer did exist i don't think i'd bother with its cord and risks given how good this is. i'm sorry to see though that it's no longer available through amazon (perhaps elsewhere on the web?). i can make a mug of tea (a generous 20 oz) around 10a.m. and even by mid to late afternoon 4 or 5p.m. it's still warm enough to enjoy. and that's after leaving the top off for the first half hour or so to let it cool enough to drink! indeed if there's a fault with it it's almost too efficient if you use boiling water for the tea and want to take a sip right after you've finished brewing! though called a travel mug it won't fit into any auto cupholder i've seen. it's really perfect for a desk. it's relatively low (taller than a typical ceramic mug though) the base is nice and wide and there's a ring of rubber/silicone type material (which has not scuffed anything on my desk) around the edge of the bottom that really is non-slip; between these features it seems quite stable. the removable black plastic top (friction secured with the typical silicone type o ring around the edge) allows you to move the opening anywhere you want to use left or right handed. there's a simple slide to open/close the drinking aperature. the interior is also stainless steel so no plastic taste. even with boiling water inside the outside remains virtually at room temperature (as you'd expect given its thermal efficiency). my only complaint (minor) is that it is not dishwasher safe (and i haven't tested it!) but it's easy to hand wash. with the wide mouth you can readily get your hand into it to clean the bottom. i have several inexpensive auto insulated mugs (key word here i think is inexpensive) that are truly underwhelming so initially i didn't have high expectations for this but it really is fantastic. if you want a hot beverage to keep for several hours on your desk this is for you! no regrets ",positive

" this is an incredibly beautiful knife with an excellent weight. well-balanced. the damascus steel is just so nice. my husband had been drooling over this knife and we received it as a wedding present from a very generous relative. this is our third expensive kitchen knife and i would say that in terms of general use--meat to vegetables--this is my second favorite with my large 8 henckel being my best knife. the shun is much nicer than the wusthof prix ii which sports the comparable santoku shape. my complaint has much to do with the design and that is that the blade is set at an angle making this a much better knife for filleting motions of which i do few. it's marketed toward general chopping and slicing but i find that slant makes my cuts less precise. it's still my husband's favorite but since i'm the one who does the majority of the cooking i'd still rate it four out of five in comparison to similarly excellent brands. but it's a real marvel to behold and i love the high quality of the wooden base and that lovely steel ",positive
" here i have a refurbished palinato x3; textured very hardy stainless; and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws -170 to start (6 mo warranty). but let me correct one point made in these reviews the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic a rather new trend that works quite well the steam nob as well seems to be this material. all around this is quite an improvement on the x1: more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the x1. cups warm quicker also. it also seems to handle ground coffee a little better. still it's important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming fat content just makes more fat not true foamed milk.

" this product looks great on my counter and is effective at prolonging the life of my garlic. amazingly it arrived with no breaks or chips despite the fact that it was poorly packed by the manufacturer (just a thin cardboard box with no padding). the only real gripe i have is that the lid does not sit flush on the top of the keeper. the hole at the top of the keeper is not perfectly round so the lid sits tilted to one side. this does not take away from the effectiveness of the product since garlic requires air circulation but it detracts from its aesthetic qualities - one of the reasons why i picked this particular product in the first place. if it were not for the flawed lid i would have given this product a five-star rating.

" i was looking for an &quot;offset serrated knife&quot; as mentioned by bourdain and this fits the bill. outstanding veggie slicer and all-around food prep instrument. even over-ripe tomatoes the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding are no match for it. besides the small and handy size the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles. when it finally begins to dull several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights ",positive

" this is the most amazing knife i have ever owned! i ve purchased henckles twinstars sabatier;which is pure junk! out of all the knives ive owned none have sliced with the mastery of these knives. i enjoy the pleasure of slicing and dicing with such serene knives. i have since decided to sell my other non global knives and replace them with all global this is quite a bold move as i consider myself thrifty with a nickle but the quality of this knife has beckon me fourth to a place where i must in fact splurge for the quality that i now know i do not want to live without. i simply cannot quantify how significant the difference in quality between these knives and henckles twinstar i really wasnt expecting to open a pandora's box of spending. it actually happened quite accidently in my wife whom loves tomatos could not find a knife to cut them properly with and well the other person who reviewed this knife stated as bold fact it got the job done like no other. i must admit this knife is truly as silly as it might sound the excaliber of knives.

" the filter model i have 18150 requires two of these with no foam spacers. two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously. however i'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall maybe slightly less. the cover still goes on but not as far down as it should. as for filtering i estimate that it filters the same as the previous. the permanence of this filter makes me wonder why i've been replacing the previous style since i can see no difference in the filter material ",positive

" in anthoney bourdain's book kitchen confidential he talks about how in a real kitchen the chefs don't use henkle or wustoff knives they use global. cat cora of american iron chef also uses global knives. i needed a good knife in my kitchen so i decided to check out global as well. first of all it's incredibly light. if i'm chopping a lot of onions for a french onion soup or making a big batch of mirepoix for some beef stock i notice that lightness. then there's the balance. see that notch where the blade meets the handle? pick the knife up by that notch and it balanced exactly level. try that with a standard knife and you'll see how handle heavy they are. finaly the edge. these knives are insanely sharp. they cut like a dream. i just went to a knife sharpening clinic by wustoff and they suggest honeing your knife with 5 or 6 stroks on a steel before every meal that you cook. i've found that this keeps the edge razor sharp. however you should realize that the edge on these knives is at 15 degrees not 20 degrees. so adjust the angle you use to hone the edge. overall it's an amazing knife. take care of it and it will serve you as a professional quality tool for a long time ",positive

" i bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz. it does a reasonable job cleaning transforming my carpet from does she ever vacuum? to oh she must have vacuumed yesterday. it doesn't get all the fuzz and crumbs but it does what i'd expect from a sweeper. it is also much lighter than my vacuum so i'm much more likely to use it. my three-year-old daughter enjoys using it too. she insists on sweeping her own room (i won't complain). the main thing i've learned is that because the handle slides together it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head. this means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle the sweeper will probably fall off so pick it up near the sweeper. (it stays together fine when actually sweeping. ",positive

" i ordered two of these great fiesta handled carafes in black. i plan to use them for serving pieces as well as for accent pieces. black is hard to come by at the local retail outlets in my area so i had to order mine without the benefit of scrutinizing the quality of finish before purchase. i have noticed at the retail places that blemishes often show up on the pieces. i was not happy when i received my carafes and both of them had glaze skips (where the white under the glaze shows through) as well as scratches in the glaze (which i have never seen before and can't imagine what happened to put them there). in my opinion these pieces should have been culled at the factory and sold as seconds. i love the pieces i'm just dissappointed with the quality of the finish. i also received a black covered butter which was blemish free ",positive
" i absolutely love the new scarlet color by fiestaware. mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice -- sometimes i think those fragile stickers result in box abuse! i was surprised at how small it was but it did say 6 and 6 it is. you won't bake a pie in it (unless you make individual ones) but it will be great for dips and sauces ",positive

" these colorful and furry little mice are great for cats that enjoy chasing small toys. they are treated with catnip but to be honest i don't think my cat knows the difference. unlike their zanies furry mice counterparts zanies rainbow mice also rattle since they have tiny pebbles inside them. a word of caution about this though: the pebbles are encased inside a semi-rigid plastic cartridge (which makes up the body of the mouse). the furry fabric is simply wrapped around this plastic piece and glued. after my cat played with one of the mice the fabric unglued itself and the plastic was exposed. since there are pebbles inside unsupervised play might not be very safe. it's best to regularly check the condition of the mice after the cats play with them. other than that these are great toys and the price/quantity/quality ratio is pretty good. quantity is important here because due to their small size most mice will most likely end up lost behind some piece of furniture. since you get 60 mice in this package you can just keep replacing the ones that go missing in action. in the long run it's a lot cheaper than buying them individually ",positive

" i think i'm a little crazy for buying this. i just had to find out if the copper-core was really better than an aluminum one. it is but not by that much. you can buy a pan from cuisinart's multiclad series that will do the same thing almost as well for a much cheaper price. that being said this thing is very well designed. the rolled-lip is useful for pouring. the radius of curvature where the bottom meets the sides is large enough to allow for utensils to easily get in there (a problem with most pans). the handle stays cool and is well designed. overall this is the best 2-quart saute pan money can buy. is it worth it? that's up to you ",positive

" if you have pets and are constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner then you will love this one. i bought this vacuum as a supplement to my large (and heavy) canister vacuum and have been pleasantly surprised by its ability to pick up pet hair. because of the small bagless chamber you have to empty it frequently so i wouldn't count on this vacuum as my only vacuum cleaner. i wanted a lightweight vacuum to use on my hardwood floors and area rugs specifically to pick up pet hair and this vacuum exceeded my expectations. i tried the shark a similar model made by fantom and another cordless vacuum and not one of them worked anywhere near as well as this one does (stay away from the fantom cordless - by far the worst!!). i don't think any cordless vacuum will have enough power to pick up pet hair like this one did. overall this vacuum is a great little vacuum for quick clean-ups or to maintain pet-hair free area rugs. one suggestion - use the carpet setting even on bare floors. the brushes are high enough so they won't scratch bare floors but the cleaning capability is much less without the rolling brush. i found that it just rolled over the dog hair without picking it up unless i used the carpet setting. the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying.

" i'm very happy with this mixer. it arrived in pristine condition even though the box it was shipped in looked very tired and worn. the machine does what i ask of it with no glitches or complaints. i bought it mainly for bread making and after a certain amount of practice i'm turning out great products. i also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients so i think i will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard. my only gripe is not with the machine but probably with amazon because i did not get the model that was pictured. i got the hd. i have researched as much as i can and the machine i received is probably identical to the one i thought i was getting but i just don't understand what is so difficult about matching the picture with the product that one is buying. seems kind of elementary to me ",positive

(well the neighbors didn't laugh anyway!) it took me a while to get the hang of it--i finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers--but she didn't complain and i had a cool dog for much less $$$ than a pro cut. the best part was i could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back. no report as yet how long the blades last but i'm already money ahead even if i must replace them next year ",positive

" i have been using a chemex 10-cup coffee maker for several weeks and have never had such good coffee before in my life. i am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee! there is a downside to this coffee maker: it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently. the first time i tried to use mine i had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever! the big time consumers: you have to boil your water separately (you do have a water kettle right?) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the chemex. this means that while the coffee is brewing you are pouring or watching or giving the filter area a bit of a stir. now the up side: you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee. i use filtered water freshly ground home roasted beans and this chemex to produce the finest coffee i have ever had the pleasure of drinking. and this coffee is a pleasure! in fact i've totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide. another up side: clean up means swishing the chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain. you can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary. a brief swish is really all it takes to get your chemex looking factory new. try that with your electric drip machine! ha! that thing will never look brand new! oh here's a final upside: this chemex brews the best coffee you'll ever drink and it costs less than just about anything. you are probably already spending more money than this every month at starbucks! go ahead and buy yourself one of these. if necessary wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee. better yet wake up 20 minutes earlier. and when your coffee is ready instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes. you deserve it! update: it's been a year now and i still love this chemex. however over time the glass acquired a coffee color tinge that gradually became darker with each use. nothing i tried got it clean but something my wife tried did: a splash of bleach in otherwise clean water followed by a thorough swishing. now my chemex looks brand new ",positive

" i bought this lightwedge for my daughter who is 7. i found out that after i put her to bed she could not go to sleep right away. she would use a flashlight to do little reading. well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light. it shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes. my only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes. i ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks. they should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes. but it does do the job ",positive

" i got excited about 5min after opening the box... most people laugh at the idea but this thing is perfect for me... i live in a decent sized apartment and always have unexpected guests... all i did was set the schedule to to the thing on twice a week while at work... lets see how that runs... just for fun as soon as i got it i plugged thehomebase charger in took the roomba to the opposite end of my apartment in another room... pushed the find home buttons and within 5 min it was charging it self.... right now i have it running around the apt just to watch it.. its entertaining circling around chair legs before its done going under furniture stopping at lint and going over it again it till it gets picked up... i dont know what to say... ive had the thing for 5 hours and im loving it... whenever it goes over wires it backs up and tries something else... and the thing sounds like a remote control car... maybe not even that loud... i was expecting it to sound like a full blown vacumm.. not the case at all.... just as a test i put a very thin cord about 6 inches long in its path to see what would happen... the thing tries everything to get it from being stuck then if it cant get it out.. it stops and makes little game over type sound effects... this thing is good... anyone who sees what its doing to my apt will wind up getting it. i will update this if anything changes. hope you get the same results ",positive

" my dog is simply crazy about these treats. but what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well. since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi-long lasting morsel of enjoyment. in additon to that since these treats are all natural they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats making them extra healthy. the price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you can't beat the quality.

" i normally don't write reviews... but after owning several toasters in the past and being very disappointed i just had to write about this one. i owned an old toastmaster 4 slice toaster for about 20 years. it never did brown evenly but was a workhorse until finally the bread crumb tray broke. got my money's worth. i have done a lot of research on toasters on epinions amazon and others... and many people haven't been very happy with toasters they have bought costing nearly $300.00 (dualit). toastmaster ge rival dualit most kitchenaid and sunbeam models were poorly rated. i found one review on this sunbeam (this is their top of the line model the chrome and black model costs more but currently not in production.) and the person really really liked it. so i ordered this from amazon directly this was the very lowest price i could find. order something else so as to get their free shipping!!! (over $25.00) so what happened when i got it. got the toaster... plugged it in... dropped two slices of bread in and excitedly waited for my toast. a few minutes passed..... then.. pop! its done... or so i thought. when the toast came out... it was brown only on one side the other side poorly toasted. this goes for both slices. right then and there i was ready to send this thing back. well.... had been busy that week and continued using it day after day... each day was as disappointing as the first..... then.... after a little over a week.... the bread started toasting... uh.. well perfectly!!! after owning this for nearly 4 months... it still browns evenly on both sides of each piece of bread crisp on the outside soft on the inside. i don't know why it started working right... wouldn't think that it would need to be broken in to work right. i am so glad that i didn't send this back right after the first several toastings.... procrastinating worked out in my best interest for the first time. i have not tried bagels in this... don't like bagels.... but it does well for what i bought it for. i think the style is rather funky but many people have liked its looks. if this toaster works for you as good as it has for me... i think you will like it!!! if it doesn't work well right out of the box.... you might give it a few days.... maybe the toast fairy will bless you too.

" the distribution of heat in this pan is super!great for gravies and sauces. i have found it practical for stir fry and other similar cooking. stir frying can reduce fats and is usually a pretty healthy way to eat a wide variety of veggies and other delightful ingredients. i even use it to pop brown rice or basmati rice. ever tried hot puffed rice? sometimes i eat it just like pop corn but often just for a different way of serving rice. this pan is deep enough with or without the lid to keep it from popping out of the pan (depending how much you start with). it is also useful to cook or finish foods in the oven up to 500 degrees. and it is kitchenaid. i expect it to outlast me ",positive

" i purchased this for a betta fish which was a gift for my cats. this model was perfect because the lid screws on which eliminates any fear of my cats lifting the lid to get to the fish. there is a small hole at the top so you don't have to unscrew the lid to feed the fish. the aqua gems cover the bottom but i added some gravel for additional covering. also the aqua gems are light and you lose some when changing the water so some other covering will likely need to be added eventually. the one negative i found is that the light is basically useless. it illuminates nothing and the batteries die quickly. other than that i'm very satisfied. i did look at petsmart for additional oxygen stones but they don't sell them. not sure if those are really necessary though ",positive

" i bought the machine about 2 weeks ago and it took me about 5 min to read the instructions and use the machine. sorry but one would have to be an idiot not to understand how to use it. i love its versatilitye.g. espresso coffee or pods regular water or add bottle (for those whose tap water is bad (comes with an adapter)) froth maker for capuccino or steam water for tea. it sure will draw wows from your friends. as long as you remember to run a cup of water through before each time you use it your espresso should be the perfect temperature. took me some time to realize why it was lukewarm. the only bad thing (why i gave it 4 and not 5 stars) i have to say about the granos is that in order to remove the portafilter i.e the part with the handle holding the coffee you have to use force. but maybe after a few months it will loosen up a bit and things will be easier. all in all i am completely satisfied with its user-friendliness crema temperature and versatility.

" this is a great pan. aside from the fact that it is easily the best non-stick on the market (and i have used anolon calphalon and scanpan) what continues to impress me most about this pan is its even heat distribution. there are no hot spots not even the center. when sauteing the food colours evenly (even when the pan is a little overcrowded); when stewing you often see tight little bubbles across the surfact of your food demonstrating how even the heat distribution is. this pan also makes a fine risotto. oh and did i mention its non-stick is simply the best. clean up is a breeze. nothing sticks. even baked on pasta sauce wipes out with a little water. the surface on swiss diamond is so good that if you make pancakes it is often hard to get the turner under the pancake without sending the pancake to the other side of the pan! swiss diamond is the king of non-stick as not only is their surface no. 1 but the quality of their pans is second to none. i own two swiss diamond pieces i plan to buy more and i couldn't recommend these pans more highly. this is the pan i reach for the most ",positive

" i bought this set after the recent issues with teflon. i did my research on all non-teflon items and decided upon iron cast pans as the aluminum pans do give off some aluminum into the food and may (key word here is may) contribute to alzheimer's (according to some) and the stainless steel gives off chromium and nickel into the foods both of which i am allergic too. pure copper with no aluminum is extremely expensive; a good set of a few items are $600+. there are also ceramic glass pots and pants made by corning/pyrex called visionware (also known as visions) that can be found on ebay (and a few are left here on amazon) as they are no longer in production. finally there are also items made of ceramics and clay that should be safe alternatives the items have been great so far however you will really want to do some research in google (or any other search engine) on how to care for them as there are some things that you really shouldn't do such as rinse a very hot pan in cold water (it will crack or break) etc. in addition you will also want to so some research on how to season them which makes them very close to being non-stick (you basically smear them with an oil than can take high temperatures and bake the pans for an hour at 350 degrees fahrenheit). i did this and i just made eggs from eggbeaters without any oil which always used to stick in my nonstick teflon pan but very little stuck in my seasoned cast iron pan. the downsides are that the handle can get hot when it is left on the stove for long period of time and that you cannot stick the pan into the dishwasher (and i tried....it will come out a little bit rustier-but the little rust does come off very easily). the sizes are also a little bit on the smaller side for me. so i think i will buy one more in a larger size. the upsides are price no chemicals (except for some iron) in your food easy to care for and very non stick when seasoned. this is a great starter set ",positive
" ok let me start by saying i am not a coffee snob i am more of a coffee nut i very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers i wont turn up my nose. and for a guy like me this machine is perfect!! i looked at the 500 dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something i see myself using 4-5 days out of the week so i setteled on this machine and i have not one regret. i have had the machine about 3 weeks now i admit i dont use it every day as i have thoses mornings where i am just running late and dont have time but in that three weeks i have used it at least 5 days out of every week and it has been great. this thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods i was just amased my old machine went down quite a while ago so i havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine i was sipping a great one in minutes! the one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods i bought the machine thinking i would use them as they seemed so convient...and dont get me wrong the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso i have ever had very quickly but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and i have found it better to just pack my own double shots. but besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for be it a straight shot a cappucino or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you may not be good enough for a coffee snob...but just right for a coffee nut! oh and one hint i found very helpfull...turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes before you are going to use it (the longer the better) with your cups up on the warmer. i saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out i exprenced the same problem when i dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso!

" it's pretty comfortable but what new mattress isn't? the foam-memory material takes a little getting used to. i generally prefer a very firm mattress and had to get used to the sinking-in feeling. i've also found you can't really use a lot of pillows. what i like about it is that if someone else tosses and turns or gets out of bed you don't feel it. the smell people are referring to is like an industrial product smell but it isn't as obnoxious as it's made out to be but definitely present. if ignored it will linger for about a month or so. i didn't try to spray anything on it because it didn't really bother me that much. over all it's a good mattress although not the greatest thing since sliced bread. i'm sure it will last a lot longer than a regular mattress and feel i've definitely gotten my moneys worth. i would recommend it.

" i got this pan because i've been coveting all-clad when reading reviews of high-end cookware and because of the low price. i figured that the low price made it a teaser--something to get you prepared to pay the fortune you need to buy other items in the line. it's a nice pan but limited. on the good side it's hefty has a perfectly flat bottom for good contact with the stove heats evenly and holds the heat. it is not non-stick so i use it when i want the contents to produce the fabled &quot;brown bits&quot; that come up with deglazing. stuff sticks unless you use a lot of fat. as noted by other reviewers it does not have a pouring spout. the rim is squared off so the pouring stream tends to be very wide. my other major gripe is that it does not have a lid. all-clad lids are pricey like everything else in their line. i sometimes use a cheap tempered-glass lid with it. i still covet all-clad pans but not as much as i did before ",positive

" this is the best most beloved item in my kitchen!!! i only wish i had bought the grinder and all the different cups (which i am going to now add on). i read some of the other reviews---and at first i was also disappointed with this blender. now that i have learned how to use it i love it!!! do not put protein powder into it first it will get stuck in the bottom of the cup which you invert onto the blades (when you invert it the bottom becomes the top). if you put liquid in first and then the powder there's no problem. you have to learn how to use it. you will want to put the frozen fruit in last if you are making something really thick. i read the reviews here before i bought mine and a woman said hers was junk but i went ahead and read the rest of the reviews and decided to buy it. if mine breaks in a year it will have been well worth the price. i use it every day and sometimes three times a day. on a hot day when i want something slushy and cold i'll put in orange juice with some strawberries and ice---in a flash you have a refreshing drink. it's fabulous. i could use my cuisinart but this blender is so easy and quiet by comparison. there are no buttons to push you just fill the cup with your juice (i often add protein powder) and something frozen (ice or frozen fruit) and screw on the lid (which have blades in it) and put it on the blending base and twist. you can either twist and pusle it or twist and leave it to blend on its own. then you take the lid off rinse and that's it. i love hummus and i will never make it in the blender because you have to dig it out and most of it gets left behind. with this gadget you fill the cup blend it then screw off the blade lid screw on the refrigerator lid and that's it. nothing to scrape just put it in the refrigerator. (oh yes you do have to rinse off the blade lid that's the whole clean-up). if you like frozen drinks or sauces you blend this is a great gadget!!! i live in two places and i am getting another one for the other place but i'm buying the complete set this time ",positive
" it does everything i need it to and more! i'm a raw foodist so i don't need something that will cook foods like some of the other high-powered blenders will. however if that's what you need one for this will do that too. the l'equip is the only blender i have ever used without the lid (not advised for households with children). i can start it out at a crawl and go up to blindingly fast with a turn of the knob. i liked my original one so much that i bought one to have at the office so my green smoothies could be made fresh for lunch. alton brown was showing off his appliances on good eats and he has a l'equip too. made me feel famous ",positive

" i love my spice rack don't get me wrong--i mounted it under my cabinet to increase storage space in my tiny kitchen. unfortunately sometimes when i spin it (gently as always) the entire rack comes off and falls apart! the spices go everywhere and creates a mess--not to mention wastes spices. i had it come off twice in one week. it happens if we spin it clockwise or counter clockwise--there is no way to 'lock' it into place it sits in a channel but is not locked. so look out when you spin or put your other hand underneath it to steady it. also--really fine spices like cinnamon tend to escape and dust behind. i don't mind it but if you're a clean freak it'll drive you insane--it gets everywhere ",positive
" i have had this product for 8 yrs - before the internet! i make a meal for my husband & family every nite & could hardly live without this product. it really eliminates the need to wash & dry measuring spoons and takes all the hassle out of making dishes with many ingredients - at least you don't have to get a utensil out for measuring spices. i have had this product in 3 homes (i'm a military spouse) and it has been able to mount under the cabinets in 2 houses thus saving me valuable counterspace & cabinet space due to the small kitchens in military housing. i would highly reccommend this to those who like to cook in tight spaces. every move i just empty the spices & run the canister thru the dishwasher then set out to dry. of course the labels had started to come off after 7 years so i simply printed out some new cutesy labels for those spices i constantly measure. as i remember the labels that came with the package included most every spice you could ever want. money well spent -- 8 yrs ago my hubby bought this for me & it has survived a lot of cooking and moves ",positive

" i bought one of these on a whim when the product launched just before christmas 2006. it seemed like a perfect - if unnecessary - stocking stuffer for my wife since we're both wine enthusiasts. i never really felt these gimmick aerators did much that a solid 1/2 hour decanting couldn't do. boy was i wrong. the device itself is attractive compact and solidly built. it appears to be a simple oblong plexiglass funnel with a rubber grip. there are two small channels in the center of the funnel which look like cracks in the plastic (i've read product info that assures worried buyers these cracks are proper and unavoidable). wine is poured through the top of the funnel and immediately a suction sound is heard as the pouring draws air into the wine before it escapes out the bottom of the funnel. the aerator is easily held and i've never had a problem with spills. now on to the effect of the vinturi. i've been using the vinturi for 5 months now on a variety of wines ... from a bottle of two buck chuck to a nice '98 vietti barolo to a bottle of 97' phelps insignia. in every circumstance with every wine i've noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the wine when poured through the vinturi as opposed to tasted directly from bottle. the flavours are more blended the finish is less acidic and frankly it has made most of the wines i drink a more pleasurable experience from sniff to swallow. i've conducted several blind tastings with friends and we all agree - this thing works. if you're a serious wine drinker - or shopping for a wine drinker in your life - give this product a try. at $40 it's about the price of a decent california cabernet and will yield results for decades to come. i plan on picking up a few dozen this christmas and giving them out as gifts to business clients ",positive

" we just purchased ours this past week and we love it!! we've had glass coffee makers before and we used to waste so much coffee because it sat on the burner and burnt. now we throw away nothing! sometimes we wake up the next morning and there is still a half a pot left. a good 1 minute zap in the microwave and it tastes just as good as it did when it was first brewed. this is our second thermal coffee maker and we have found that unless you remove the coffee filter holder after each use and rinse it it will leak all over. coffee grounds get stuck in the little holes where the coffee comes out and into the thermal pot. also to stop the leak problem be careful when putting in coffee grounds make sure none get past it. im a little surprised at the negatives reviews on this product. its an in expensive coffee maker and it does the job very well. the over-flowing of coffee and the leakage problem is due to improper housekeeping. we havent had any problems with this.

" rarely does a product move me to write a review but i have found myself increasingly using the net (and amazon) to review products i am not really familiar with before buying them. rice cookers were one of those products. so i thought i'd share my experience since i had a hard time finding a review for this rice cooker to help others out. we were microwave rice and stovetop rice cookers until we started eating a lot of sushi. then we wanted something to make the perfect rice. this is it. the first time we used it i let my girlfriend make the rice. it boiled over and made a huge mess and came out totally mushy. i was bummed i spent $200 on a rice cooker that was going to be messy or difficult to use. then i watched my girlfriend making it the second time and realized she was putting in 2 times the amount of water required. following the directions the 25 or 30 times we have used it since we get absolutely perfect rice. white rice sticky rice whatever. it is sylish so it doesn't look like a little crock pot sitting in my contemporary kitchen the cord retracts into the base for convenience and the thing couldn't be easier to clean. the rice pot the lid and the steam vent pop out and are easily cleaned. wipe the rest down with a damp paper towel and you're done. so easy. rarely is set it and forget it associated with perfection but in this case it is. would i prefer if it was $100-$150 sure. but i paid $200 and don't regret it.

" being a wine lover i've used all kinds of corkscrews from your basic twist model to the kind with the wings to the two-pronged kind. finally i received the screwpull as a gift and my search for the perfect corkscrew came to an end! as others have said the screwpull effortlessly lifts the cork up so there's no actual pulling whatsoever--all you do is simiply turn the easy-to-use lever at the top of the device. in almost 10 years of usage the screwpull has never failed to easily and cleanly remove a cork; on the rare occasions when it had trouble removing the cork on the first try (probably because i started too close to the edge) simply starting over solved the problem. spend a little more money to buy the screwpull and you'll never need to buy another corkscrew again; highly recommended ",positive
" we bought one for my home office and my largest cat loved it but couldn't fully fit on it (he likes to stretch out when he sleeps). he was doing whatever he could to make it work. so then we bought a second one to put right next to the first and his reaction was one of pure love and ecstasy. one cat can get on each although the largest will share space from the other.

" what an awesome product! heavy-duty and sturdy you'd never know it was an assemble-at-home item. it's a quality piece of furniture. it's on wheels which is a good thing because it is surprisingly heavy. let's start at the top: the butcher block top. it's three inches thick and as such it is the heaviest part of the entire kitchen cart. it is made of fine high-quality asian hardwoods. the finish is oiled and the manufacturer recommends seasoning it regularly with mineral oil. the next is the cart itself. immediately under the butcher block top there is a 2 deep drawer. it's large and deep enough to accommodate a standard utensil holder or other items of your choice. the pull handle on the drawer is fashioned out of brushed chrome. beneath the drawer there is a shelf. surrounding the shelf on three sides are brushed chrome rods adding a modern look. matching the brushed chrome are three hooks on the right side of the cart perfect for hanging larger utensils or pot holders. below the shelf is a cabinet with two doors. the pull handles for the doors also have a brushed chrome finish. the cabinet is large enough to hold an entire set of dinnerware (as in my case where i have eight place settings that include dinner and luncheon plates fruit and soup bowls and more). finally heavy-duty professional grade caster wheels support the whole thing. the two in the front are locking. to prevent stubbed toes the wheels can easily be rotated and tucked under the unit. the easy to follow directions for assembly (which are diagrammed and in english) call only for a philips screwdriver. a hex wrench is included for the 18 hex bolts. i used an electric screwdriver for both the philips screws (14 in all) and the hex bolts (after i found the right sized hex tip for my screwdriver). i can happily report that all pieces fit together easily (no struggling to match up this piece with that piece) and all holes are pre-drilled. the drawer requires assembly also. the runners for the drawer are already attached! you must put together the front sides and back of the drawer with screws (again all holes are pre-drilled). a word of advice regarding assembling the drawer: follow the directions where it says to put the screws in only halfway before trying to attach the bottom of the drawer. i made the mistake of tightening the screws too much and had trouble sliding the bottom into the assembled front back and sides. it's a snug fit. once i loosened the screws enough the bottom easily popped into place and i was able to sock it in securely by tightening the screws. i have only one other thing to mention regarding the assembly of the entire cart: once the body of the cart is assembled and the unit is standing upright you must lift the butcher block and set it down on the top of the cart. at this point you have already placed four cam lock screws on the top of the cart and they're pointing upward. these screws will fit into four pre-drilled holes on the bottom of the butcher block. you must align the screws on the cart with the holes on the butcher block as you place the butcher block on top of the cart. because the butcher block is so heavy you may want to have help. but what a reward it was to see the unit fully assembled and then to marvel at what a quality piece of furniture it ended up being. ikea sells a similar item for twice the money. i give the home styles double door kitchen cart with butcher block top 5 stars because of the beauty of the product and its better-than-a-bargain price ",positive

" i purchased the smallest version the lw 14 for the purpose of cleaning the air in a small kitchen without windows. air ionizers didn't rid the air of the frying smells but this appliance works. the initial price is high but not the cost to keep the venta running. water is cheap. power consumption on highest setting is about 35 watt. for whisper-quiet use in a bedroom a lower setting is better. any air-con would be much louder anyways and drown out the venta on the highest setting. the motor used to power the machine is indeed very silent and possible can't be manufactured for 30$. the other components are ruggedly constructed and hopefully last many years. the device can also be used for aromatherapy which i'm just testing with some natural mint oil against my cold ",positive

" i read the reviews before i purchased this machine. i know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of. so with this in mind i will put in my 2 cents. i have had my machine for two months and i use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults a 4 year old and two dogs. generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket. you must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease. the machine is set up to auto-shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low. i agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine. a powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive. i see what hoover was trying to do with this machine. they were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine. they gave it a good shot but for all of us clean-freaks this machine doesn't quite hit the mark. the water/cleaning solution section is in my humble opinion to small. i run out of water quickly and i have a very small kitchen. but the good news is that my kitchen is so small i can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up. :) one more comment before i give my final review...remember to follow the instructions and use only the kind of cleaners hoover recommends. there's a reason for this. if you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die! the grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets. so my final opinion is this. if you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it's a great time saver. it's a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac-up of dog hair scrub and mop. any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment mop and bucket routine. if you are a cleanfreak like me you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand-and-knees scrub. no machine will ever leave you satisfied. this machine was definately not made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it's great. i am giving this machine 4 stars because i think it does what it was designed to do...light cleaning. i would have given it 5 stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice. when hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards i'll be all over it! until then i'll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month.

" i just received this set yesterday and haven't had a chance to actually bake a pizza in it yet (i'll try to remember to update this review once i do) but there were a few initial impressions i thought merited a review on their own: - the cookbook mentioned in the title and description of this product was not actually included in the package. instead the kit contained a small fold-out pamphlet with four or five basic recipes and a card advertising where to obtain the aforementioned cookbook. (i doubt anyone orders this set strictly because of the cookbook or even that it sways many would-be buyers who are on the fence about the value of the kit. but its absence does make a small difference in the value of the purchase and is something you should know before you buy.) - that having been said the pans and lid themselves look and feel so good i have no doubt whatsoever that they'll be wonderful functional additions to my kitchen. the hard-anondized surface gives a distinct impression of quality and durability. i'm impressed. and i'll be back to say more once i actually use them to make pizzas!

" i received this coffeemaker as a christmas gift and was initially skeptical of the thermal carafe being able to make hot coffee and the basket-style filter. after using the maker for a week i have to say my skepticism was unjustified. this machine makes great-tasting coffee that is as hot as i could want it. i never liked the cooked coffee that regular glass-carafe makers produced - burned tasting after the first cup. the coffee from this machine is consistent from the first cup to the last. i fill the carafe with hot water mill my beans and fill the reservoir empty the carafe and enjoy. after two hours the coffee was still hot. one great feature not highlighted is the front-fill aspect: kitchenaid designed the top with a channel to fill the reservoir by pouring the water from the front right next to the filter. no more struggling to pour water in the back and see the water level. extremely convenient. i have to disagree with the previous reviewer - this machine makes ten 5-ounce cups. after reading the review i double-checked the carafe capacity against my old krups machine: exactly 10 cups; more than enough for our household. all in all a great-looking great-performing coffeemaker that meets kitchenaid's high standards. i highly recommend it ",positive

" the kitchen odors were getting very bad. we realized that the filter had never been changed. it is an old recirculating system over the stove. finding filters is for the birds. filters are all listed by a serial or code number. i think the psychology is that you use only the filter from the original manufacturer. after looking at many different types of filters these seemed to be cutable-is that a word? we did not need to cut they fit into the nutone range hood perfectly. our nutone hood is so old that we could not find anything listed on the nutone site. so these fit the house odor while cooking is diminished. what is not clear is how often they should be replaced. obviously when the smell gets worse but i have no idea if 6 months or 6 years. will buy more cheaper than a new hood ",positive

" when trying to decide if this model (3670g) was the right vacuum for me i found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it's features on the internet..and from the manufacturer itself. first of all many online retailers flat out state (inaccurately) that this model has a hepa (high efficiency particulate air) filter and at least one of the reviews for it here on amazon (at least as of this writing) seems to indicate that it has one as well. i can tell you outright that having checked with the manufacturer directly and now owning one myself that it does *not* have a hepa filter. more on that a little later in this review however. i found another confusing aspect of the description is in the model number (i.e. 3670g). be careful to understand the difference between what amazon calls the 3670 (also called the 3670a in some places) and the 3670*g* models. they look identical and appear to be identical (both are yellow and black) however the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor and the 3670g has the larger 12 amp motor. amazon carries both models and i almost ended up buying the smaller one thinking it was the same vacuum. for only about a $5-$10 difference in total price i'm not sure why the smaller version is even offered. it only seems to confuse the matter. the 3670 also does *not* have the hepa filter incidentally. i found the 3670g to be an excellent value however and am pleased with my purchase. it is compact very powerful and great for my needs. the noise...while high...is quite tolerable and not at all excessive considering how well it cleans. the generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful not having one is a reasonable trade-off in keeping the price down. the blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides (by blowing away dust without contacting electrical components as vacuuming would risk doing). the 3670g *does* require bags. it is not a bagless model however and while some may prefer a bagless model i preferred a model that used bags. the bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense for what i consider to be the additional convenience (of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag). the only reason i gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because i did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate. three attachment tools are included a crevice tool a 10 floor tool and a combination tool with a triangularly-shaped brush (about 2 wide) on the end. the combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick-up (3 wide). in my opinion this cleaner badly needs a mid-sized brush and/or pick up tool that is about 4-5 wide. the 2 wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power but being only 2 wide i found that i simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces (such as a wall for example) in order to cover the area needed. i would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4-5 wide had been included. as it is i am searching for an optional brush that size to purchase extra. finally a comment about the hepa filter. some people (particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air) may want cleaners that include this item. in my case i did not want this since i don't need it and hepa filters can be quite expensive to change and replace (unless you get a washable one...also expensive). since many online descriptions i found were unclear whether the 3670g included this filter (some descriptions flatly stated that it does) i found myself calling the eureka customer service number to find out for sure. it turned out that even eureka's own customer service representative was unsure whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it didn't have one. if you *do* want the hepa filter you would want the 3684d...which looks the same but is red in color slightly more expensive and has more and better quality attachments as well as the hepa filter. by the time you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment (which i mentioned earlier that i think is needed on the 3670g) you are at the price of a 3684d. in that case the 3684d may well be a better value for you particularly if you like the hepa filter. overall i think the boss series of canister vacuums is a great product. eureka (and amazon as well) needs to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however.

" i was searching for a speaker system with docking capabilities for my ipod video and boy did i find a nice one! with the arched back speaker portion of the stereo it provides a surround-sound like atmosphere. also it has quite a loud capacity for volume. i mean if you wanted to you could really get it crankin'. anyway it charges your ipod for you just like the computer and it will accomadate any style ipod. the sound clarity is very crisp and clear. the only tiny flaw i could find in this fine piece of audio was that in between songs a soft high-pitched whine is sometimes incurred. however once the song begins to play this whine disapears immediately. i would strongly suggest purchasing this item if you would like a quality speaker system for a reasonable price ",positive

" i've lusted after a super auto for years. when i finally decided to get one i did a fare amount of investigating. the gaggia titanium had the best spec's for the price and good reviews. i decided to spend the extra money for the stainless unit. i haven't seen the painted plastic model so i can't comment on the appearance. i do think the stainless looks great! you can find reviews of the non-stainless here on amazon and other than the outside appearance the device is the same. i've only had the unit for a few days but so far i'm very happy. to the negatives first. the manual is awful! it's not just the italian to english translation! the text is skimpy and the illustrations not so great. i spent a fair amount of time making sure i understood how to setup and use the unit. i'm pretty technically savvy and in the end i figured it all out. but don't rush into using this product until you've figured out how to set it up clean it and adjust all the settings (there are many). the only issue i've had is whereby the auto bean grinder thinks it's empty when it's not. open the lid (which could be a bit better designed) and stir and it works. could be the beans i'm using not sure. it's an intermittent issue. the good stuff: once you figure out the coffee strength and grind the gaggia makes a delicious cup. i wish the brew were a tad hotter (i have it set to max) but using the cup warmer helps. no issues making froth with the wand; much better than the older manual machine i had. you can't put a huge mug under the unit (the max size is 4.5 inches) but its so easy to make a cup you just make fresh when needed. you can set the unit for the amount of brew. however i found that clicking the large coffee button twice the unit thinks it's making 2 cups and that just about fills a decent size mug. it's much stronger too since the unit grinds two doses of coffee instead of just adding more hot water using the programmable size. you get a nice foam on top and as i said the coffee is outstanding. i love the clean up (or lack of) compared to the drip maker i had (a bodum vacuum unit). i still have that unit should i need to make a lot of coffee for company. but for the two mugs i drink in the morning the gaggia easily replaces this unit. and there's far less cleanup. the grinds sit in a canister and after a few days you just tap it out into the trash and maybe rinse. so you can use this gaggia to replace a conventional coffee machine as long as you're making a cup or two. what i love is just pressing a button twice (for two large coffees) and walking away from the unit. a minute later a great cup of joe. it truly is super automatic. i have the unit set for energy savor whereby it's in a kind of sleep mode a few hours after i use it. i only drink in the morning. however if you decide to wake it up it heats up in about 2 minutes. it also does a rinse cycle so i keep a small glass under the unit so it can clean itself and rinse out about 3oz of water. there is a little pan under which would catch the water but then you have to toss it out ever few days. there's also a full rinse cycle that thoroughly cleans out the unit and uses about half the water in the reservoir. it's a menu item so don't select it unless you really want to do this (takes about 5 minutes and a lot of water goes into the catch pan or several cups if you so desire). yes it cost big bucks but as long as it works well for years and keeps its great looks i'm very happy. update. the issue with the grinder was the beans (too oily). i called the ny office and got someone in tech support in minutes. she knew her product. sure enough the inside of the grinder area was super oily making it hard for the beans to fall into the grinder area.

" i've had my juicer now for about 3 years and i haven't had any problems with it. in fact after having had several juicers this one is my favorite in the price range. i also don't understand the customer service problems. one of the rubber feet on the bottom split and i called customer service. a week later i had four new ones in the mail! pros - much quieter than most juicers of its type. as well i did a side by side comparison with my buddie's juiceman juicer and my yield was approximately 30% greater. cons - as with any other similar juicer cleaning it gets old. that's probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times/day ",positive
" just a word of advice: if your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up. if they aren't it probably is not the toy for your dog. at first my chocolate lab was a little leery because he never had a bottle as a toy. it took a couple days of playing tug of war and leaving the tug a jug on the floor before he really knew it was his. once i finally got him used to realizing it was his own he saw me put his kibble in it. then it took a little bit before he was able to figure out how to work it. granted the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy's value. now it is something that can occupy him for 20-25 minutes. he'll do anything for treats. although i'm not sure that he really really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears. i think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats. i like interactive toys :) on the other hand our little dog still doesn't know how to get the treats out or how to use this toy. just a guess he probably never will figure it out. so some dogs will take to it and others will look at you like you're crazy for giving them a toy that doesn't squeak ",positive

" i've had this pot for over a year and love it. fast hot great tasting coffee which stays hot and fresh for a long time. i bought it after my last electric perk had died at age 10 years because i loved the looks of it and there were limited choices at the brick-and-mortars. i read all the reviews only after i bought it. the reviewers' major complaint is about the plastic knob cracking. yes the plastic knob is poorly-designed and is the only reason i give this pot 4 stars instead of 5. the designer should have known that users would take the lid off the pot by using the knob. however it is completely possible to remove the lid without touching the knob at all. just pop the lid by pushing in and up near where the lid meets the pot. this is what i've been doing since i bought the pot and i've had absolutely no problems with the knob. it's unlikely you'll need to remove the lid while the coffee is still hot so you can avoid burned fingertips. a secondary complaint is about grounds in the coffee. i've never had this problem; i suspect users who have are either not careful when spooning the coffee into the basket or they are using the wrong grind. it's important with any percolator to use a percolator grind or fac 'for all coffeemakers' grind.

" the coat rack works wonderful for us we hang our robes (tend to be thick and heavy) before going into the hot tub. it was very easy to assemble lightweight yet it holds the robesas one expects a coat rack to do. i don't understand the reviews that indicated difficulty assembling or trouble with its stability none of that is the case for us.

" i had all but given up hope on electric can openers until i bought this one. you can tell when you pick it up that it's of good quality (not cheap plastic junk). the removeable head is also very solid/heavy duty and washes easily in the dishwasher. the black and chrome design looks very stylish on my kitchen counter as well. i'm a believer again in electric can openers ",positive
" have to disagree with the other reviewer here ... i purchased a baby biorb recently for my new betta after having my first betta living in an airless bowl for a couple years. i simply got tired of cleaning a stinky bowl every week. as a result i went shoppin for a new tank with a bubbler and filter system and found the baby biorb. while i agree that the maintence costs are significant at $132/ year (if you need to change a filter every 4 weeks) the costs balance with ease of maintenance. personally my experience with cleaning the baby biorb was a snap with the optional suction hose. took me fifteen minutes to clean the tank drain the grimey water and add new water. couldn't have been much easier. and i am not sure how anyone could have a problem swapping filter cartriges unless they have motor skills issues. i also built a noise dampening box for the air pump - my only real complaint is that the whisper quiet pump sounds like a mini jackhammer after about five minutes. great product and looks awesome. ",positive
" i bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon. it's a beautiful print and a good color that matches my drapes but what i didn't quite understand at the time i bought it was that it's also just one big piece of fabric. no fitted edges or elastic to hold it in place - kind of disappointing. but since i was covering a futon i was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds shove a wooden dowel into the crease and voila! a great looking couch appeared. so all things considered a pretty good buy for the money ",positive
" i own reidel as well as spieglau. the differences are slight. the spieglau have a very nice tulip shape and the heft/feel to them is very good. and given the price if i break one i don't get upset as i would with a reidel. no wonder reidel bought the company. i recommend the spieglau to anyone looking for an attractive well made glass at a moderate price. anything that helps you enjoy the champagne a little more as these do deserve to be recommended ",positive
" this is a great product. very quick to heat and i enjoy the dettachable base feature. the cons include a limited amount to pour water into the unit (the lid doesn't pop up very far) and some of the finish doesn't do great with steam. overall a good buy ",positive
" i like it very much. kettle is in a good working condition and it looks good in a kitchen with all stainless steel appliances. i would recomend to purchase this kettle as a good quality item. ",positive
" i forgot the toy needed a battery so for the first few days my cats played with it without the bird moving around in circles but mostly they ignored it. when i got the battery and the bird started moving my two older cats weren't impressed but my youngest (about 1 1/2 years) went crazy. it's pretty funny watching her with the toy; she can get fairly worked up attempting to take out the bird. it's also entertaining when she's finished playing; she has a tendency to walk away from it too slowly which means she is hit in the backside by the bird. naturally this starts the fight with the bird all over again. i'm pretty sure the other cats will play with it as well but even if it's just the kitten it's worth the money ",positive
" we have 2 airedale terriers (55-lb dogs) and 2 cats. i originally bought a scat-mat as a deterrent to the cats but it has since become a dog deterrent. one of our dogs has a tendency to knock over the gate to the kitchen and get into the trash while we're not at home. this is the only deterrent that has proven effective. it keeps her from being able to work on the gate long enough to get it down (as she'll keep getting shocked if she stands there). i feel comfortable using the product as i have been shocked by it many times myself (generally i step on it by accident in the middle of the night). make no mistake it hurts and you don't want to have it happen but it certainly isn't bad enough that i feel cruel using it. this is my second scat mat as the other one stopped working. because of that i'm a bit concerned about the durability especially considering the cost. that said however the design of this model is a vast improvement over the last (no wires going to the battery that may become detached) so i am hopeful that this one will last longer. either way however it has saved me enough hassle to be well worth the money. ",positive
" i love this honey pot; the design is dainty but the pot itself is really good-sized. a beautiful accompaniment to the matching tea set ",positive
" i received this set packed very well no scratches no broken pieces so i have no complaints. the color is beautiful and the dishes are durable. ",positive

" ive now owned my z5 for about 2 months and it is fun weve already gone through a cleary water filter. our favorite thing about the machine is the frother we normally drink capucinos and oh my is this easy and its fully programmable. i bought 2 extra milk carafes for chocolate milk and eggnog and i have solved the souring problem by adding about 25 percent ice cubes to each thermos as the ice melts it waters down the milks which make for a better froth dont try to use too thick a milk like eggnog it may not pull it through the siphon water it down or add skim for a really nice froth. i also own a manual breville which i really love for those real expensive gourmet coffees that make a single perfect shot of espresso but i still use the frother on the jura becuase its perfect everytime. so far the jura makes a better espresso for me then i can make manually so i have started grinding my expensive coffees with a burr grinder and having the jura make it for me. i love technology that allows me to enjoy coffee that only an expert could make in the past. i should have given it 5 stars but we use it so much we run it out of water and although it has the largest tank in its class its still too small if they make a wider model that has a tank on both sides i would buy it ",positive
" after spending $5-$10 a day at starbucks my wife and i got the jura-capresso for the convenience of a fully automatic machine and having fresh latte's at home in the morning. we have used it for over 3 months now and like it more and more each week. the espresso latte's and cappucino's are wonderful having to touch one button to have everything done at once is so easy but perhaps the best part is the self cleaning it does. about once a week you clean out a tray and refill the water...that's pretty much it! desserts like affogato (espresso on top of ice cream) are a just too easy to make now! downsides: -if you ever plan to reduce your caffeine consumption this machine is not for you. my wife and i both drink more coffee now because it is so good and so convenient. -if you like really hot latte's the steamed milk won't get hot enough. i'd call it very warm or slightly hot. just right for drinking but by the end it can be kind of cool. warm up the glass with the hot water option before fixes the problem. espresso coffee and even cappucino's come out at a perfect temperature ",positive
" i recommend this product. it is excellent quality. very quiet when running and has lots of power ",positive
" i love this little coffee maker. i have always been partial to the stovetop espresso makers but i have never been very comfortable brewing or cooking with aluminum. this maker is made from stainless steel which is more expensive but for me it's worth it (as it will probably last a lifetime.) it makes a very good cup of coffee and i'm very happy with it. also the customer service at the company that ships it out is excellent ",positive
" i have had many different kinds of wine openers...screwpull rabbits etc...and nothing compares to the ease of this cork pop! i have the legacy version. nice looking and takes less than 10 seconds to remove the foil and open the bottle...no kidding (okay...i haven't really timed it...). this would be great for someone with arthritic hands as there is no pulling or tugging involved...not even to remove the cork from the opener...just twist and the cork is removed. it is really the most amazing opener ever! the only downside i can think of is you will have to have cartridge refills eventually...i received mine about a month ago and have opened about 15 bottles of wine and still have plenty of juice left in the cartridge. awesome ",positive

",positive
" i like the fact that it included diff sized containers and 2 of those were tumblers with handles to boot. i have read reviews where people have burned out their motors and i will have to say that yes it's possible but only if you didn't follow the directions. the manual indicated a recommended time of usage so you should be patient expect to shake things up once in a while between blends and this unit should last you at least a year :d i think some people have the wrong expectation that you can just turn on the switch and leave the unit alone to do it's thang. gee if that was the case i'd let my car drive me on auto pilot.

" this little gadget is simple & cheap but you'd have to spend a lot more money to get a cup of coffee out of an electric coffee maker of the quality you get using this. get some really high quality coffee beans grind'em at home use about one and a half scoops into your paper filter (using a small gevalia-type scoop) take about 3 minutes (or less) to slowly pour your boiling water over the coffee grounds and you'll have a truly satisfying cup of hot coffee right up there with french press quality of flavor but hotter. i've used the same beans in my krups moka brew and they tasted awful then made the coffee using this and it made a really flavorful cup of coffee. highly recommended you try this before spending beaucoups of dollars on the high-end coffee brewers. of course if you're serving/entertaining folks you'll need your standard coffee brewer but for making great restaurant-quality coffee one cup at at time this is a nice little product to have.

" i purchased the eureka filter bags with the eureka upright boss 4870gz for my mom. she loves them both. the cord is really long on the vacuum which makes it easy to do several rooms at a time. she lives in a one level ranch so she does not have to go up steps with it because she does find it a bit heavy. beware the vacuum had to be assembled upon arrival. i live out of state and she had to get another relative to help her assemble it. the add never mentioned that small detail! someone over 65 should not have to assemble a gift vacuum! i bought the hoover wind tunnel 2 years ago for myself and it's a peice of garbage. the lever to keep it upright broke the attachments fall off the hose when in use and everthing gets tangled on the roller! i am thinking about purchasing the eureka soon for myself! i reccomend it ",positive
" as stated before in many a review this machine is the best deal for the money. paired with a real espresso grinder (which will unfortunately cost more than the machine itself) this machine is capable of producing real espresso. my father bought this for me for my birthday back in december and the machine is still in working condition. my only real beef with this machine is the wand. i can live with the lack of flexibility of where you can put the pitcher however the black turbo frother and the piece that holds it onto the wand fall off. right into my milk. i have taken to using the wand without either of them on but this isn't optimum for latte foam. the only other thing that bothers me is that i have to hold the machine still to put the portafilter back inside the grouphead. this is simply due to the lightweight plastic casing. but i'd rather hold the machine down than have to pay an extra $300 for something in stainless steel. all in all the machine saves me about 3 bucks every time i use it. woohoo. - by zoe ros not tim.

" i have only had it for a few days but moving up from a krups pump system with only 1050w of heating this unit rocks! it used to take me about 10 minutes to make a latte with the krups as it took forever to heat uo and never made enough steam. this unit heats very fast and makes fantastic steam for the frother which works fantastic minus the complaint everyone has the frother is way to low to the ground they fixed this with the evolution model. watch the video! the tamping and normal uses need to be followed very closely. i have to use the perfect crema device to make crema which it does great. this unit also can be used to heat water for tea in like 2 mins which is pretty cool. you just fire up the unit. wait till it heats then flip the espresso switch not the steam switch with the steam adjuster already open then hot water comes from the frother and boom...tea! the drip tray is worthless and is supposedly fixed in the evolution model. but for $200 this machine is amazing...very professional level equipment. the abs shell is pretty flimsy but if it stays on the counter which mine does it will be fine...i don't need to spend another $300 for the stainless model...even though i would if i has a nicer kitchen just so it matched...(i rent but still have really nice appliances).

" this is wonderful. i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me. i actually enjoy working with this. the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer but using really good litter and not too much of it stops that. i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this ",positive

" this is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes. i've owned larger crockpots for a couple decades (currently a 6 quart rival smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family-size meals) but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space & aren't at all useful for heating or re-heating small quantities. this little crockpot however is perfect for heating or re-heating 2-4 servings of soup or stew. i originally bought it however because it is *absolutely perfect* for making hot cereal on cold mornings especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop such as steel-cut oatmeal (try the nutty goodness of traditional steel-cut oatmeal once (also available here at amazon) & you're unlikely ever to return to instant or quick cook oatmeal again). there is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen & knowing that a healthy delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you. from mid-october to late-march virtually every night i prepare my entire family's hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave. other uses we've discovered: it's perfect for making & serving hot mulled cider; keeping hot dips gravies & warm sauces & syrups heated on the buffet; as a substitute fondue pot; & for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient (how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup!). for single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker especially if used in conjunction with rival's inexpensive sp100-pdq smart-part module (also sold on amazon as of the date of this review) which provides the same timed-cooking controls that are integrated with many of rival's larger more expensive crockpots. the energy used is minimal too -- only 80 watts -- & the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher as does the lid for very convenient clean-up ",positive
" i bought this set for three times for serving 12 people! i also bought a lot of the additional to the set for my whole kitchen. great investment! i love the feel of these dishes. very nice smooth feel but all the bowls look slightly different the slight inconsistancys make you feel like you have a set of hand-made set!

" when i adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago two of my good friends highly recommended fresh step premium clay cat litter. here's why-- this fresh step premium clay cat litter is excellent for your favorite kitty's litter box. the company states that it is very good at absorbing odors--and by golly it's true! the odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat. moreover i really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor causing bacteria in the litter before my cat even uses his litter box. that's a plus for any cat lover! if you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend not surprisingly that you use more cat litter in the box. otherwise if you have just one cat two or three inches worth of this cat litter spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine. you should change the entire litter box once a week on average. (i change mine about twice a week just for my cat's comfort.) it's also a good idea to scoop out any kitty remains every other day or so. be very certain not to flush any kitty presents down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this. i suppose it could clog toilet pipes. moreover as you may suspect any kitty leftovers could have some nasty germs that we don't want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any kitty presents with a scooper. the fact that this is clay litter helps because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper to remove any kitty presents thus reducing the number the times you need to change the entire kitty litter box. nevertheless i recommend changing the entire litter box at least once a week. place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag and discard as you would any other garbage. in short this is a great cat litter product at a great price. the contents of the bag last a long time especially if like me you have only one cat. the manufacturer also offers customers (us not the cats) an awards program with points that you can accumulate in your account with the company on the company internet website. a nice plus! ok fresh step--i thank you; my father and mother thank you; and most importantly my cat says thank you !!! smiles ",positive
" now i don't know whether you are a die-hard hello kitty fan or not but you gotta have this! the numerous different settings the awesome design and the fact that it's hello kitty makes it worth it's weight in gold. i had been looking for one of these cheap and i ended up getting one for the holidays! so that worked well. these toasters are cheap as they come online here so grab em and go! good luck if ya get one!
