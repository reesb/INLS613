" i bought a small one of these with blank unlined pages as a pocket sketchbook. the pocket sketchbooks commonly sold in art supply stores are one of two varieties either wire-bound or stitched. the thing is wire-bound notebooks are uncomfortable to have in a back pocket (and i just don't like the feel bumping up against the ridges of the wires on that edge) and most stitched bindings don't fold as well as the moleskine does (folding nice and wide so there's plenty of blank page to use). and to be honest i may've fallen just a little for that pompous tripe about being the sketchbook of great artists. the thing is the paper is terrible. all the 'bloggers and geeks i've heard raving about these notebooks use them for their laundry lists or their ideas to write about or god knows what. and while i'm not the best artist around i did minor in fine arts in school so i'm not completely clueless. so take my word (or don't; it's your loss); the paper is just plain bad. most drawing paper has some degree of tooth--the roughness of the paper which rubs off your graphite or charcoal smoothly onto the page. the tooth on these sketchbooks is nonexistent. rather than describe in more detail the paper however i believe i can give an apt description in two words. manila folder. that's what the paper in these books is like so as to be nearly indistinguishable (slightly smoother in fact than manila folders--even less tooth). while paper quality is something of a personal preference i've never seen anyone use any paper remotely similar to this for drawing so i have to question the claim that these pads are identical to those used by picasso et al. on a positive note the binding is great the covers are great and the elastic strap bookmark ribbon and back pocket are all great features. but when it comes down to it i care most about the paper quality. if you want to just write get one of these. if you intend to do any serious drawing don't bother.

" this is a review of the avery 3279 ink jet dark t-shirt transfers. but i wouldn't be surprised to discover that the rest of the stuff they make is also junk. this stuff is expensive....over $15 for five sheets from office depot. i had put in a brand new ink cartridge just a couple of days prior (hp psc 1410 inkjet) and it was working fine on normal paper. read all the directions carefully and more than once. first time the paper cut off the top portion of the image.....sure blame it on the printer; but if so why didn't normal paper do this? second time it printed really wimpy and hazy grey....yet i had set the printer to use maximum dpi! i thought ok maybe it will darken from the heat of the iron. set the kitchen timer ironed it exactly as instructed....and it is still a sickening hazy grey instead of the crisp black i wanted! and some of the darkness of the fabric below is showing through the white portions. oh yes...it is incredibly difficult to peel off the backing...you do end up having to tear a portion of the design you create pretty much ruining it. so....wasted time shopping for this. overpaid for the product. wasted hours prepping the image. and now i have a ruined tote bag that can't be replaced. avery scum i hate you ",negative
" this is a great address book but you should know that the price coming out of the factory is $9.95 not the higher prices cited in this listing ",negative
" though lacking good directions this was straightforward to assemble. however it is flimsy and tilts whenever i lean on it ever so slightly. i am getting rid of it. ",negative
" this stand is nicely designed in terms of function and it also looks very appealing. the problem is that there are no assembly instructions just a few pictures and the design is faulty for assembly. for instance the hardware can attach the wrong way to the bottom of the smaller shelf when it would have been easy to design it so that the hardware can only go on one way; it took 90 minutes to assemble by 2 skilled men because the pole for each shelf didn't fit well into the mainframe poles (we had to use soap and three people holding and pushing) and the stand had some gashes in it though it was advertised as new. changing the height of this stand takes 2 people because at first it won't move and then it falls and hits your knee. now that it's together we're using it but what a price ",negative
" poor communication. i was notified that the printer was not coming when they said it would but was never given another date. after waiting some time i cancelled the order and said i ordered another one from someone else. i guess they don't read their email either. the next day they shipped the item. now i have two but am not going to spend another $20 to ship it back to them. believe me i would never buy from this company again ",negative
" these books are a good idea for the repeat visitor to a city-- basically just a place for notes in the lovely (i think) moleskine format. the maps though can be found better and cheaper on other places. more important this seller has claimed a falsely inflated list price and consequent discount that is misleading. the list price for these books is 17.95. check in any book store. shame on the seller ",negative

" i bought this machine at michael's (craft store) for use with polymer clay. the machine was very poorly made and broke on the second day of use! the clamp that helps hold it to the table did not fit properly so i had to borrow some of my husband's clamps so it wouldn't move around....but then while using it the dials (that gauge the thickness of the clay) completely broke. i returned it and am going to get a nicer atlas machine. don't waste your time with this one....you'll only be disappointed and frustrated with it ",negative
" okay here is the deal. this thing is built well but it's dimensions and performance work against it. it's height and width are just right for a pocket book but it's thickness gets it in trouble. it's a clunker if you put this thing in your pocket (if it will fit) you will feel it. hell it might even pull your pants down. the thickness also makes it awkward to write in since it never folds flat and there is always resistance when jotting down an idea which makes writing a chore (which is counter productive to the pocketbook ideal which is maximum convenience). if you are looking for a real nice small notebook opt for a moleskine. pass on this clunker ",negative
" i don't know why they changed from the old layout to the new skinny vertical columns. the old planner was a lifesaver but this new layout is unusable. they claim to be the artist's notebook but what artist is really going to be breaking their day down hour by hour? and even if someone wanted to do that the tiny columns are worthless. really a shame ",negative

" i was very excited about this product given the good reviews. however i found that refilling the pencil took so much force that i was afraid i'd break it. even worse the eraser is useless due both to the design and the material. if i could find a replacement eraser that was taller & better this would be a much better product. if i have to carry this plus a separate eraser it's not really saving me much. oh and the highlighter isn't a marker. maybe i'm stupid but i assumed it would be. it's just an orange ink pen which is not the same as any other highlighter i'd choose to use ",negative
" the penny nickel and dime molds are defective: the paper sleeves i got from my bank barely fit inside and therefore wrinkle or fold-over leaving no room for the coins to be dropped in and layered one atop the other. the penny one was so tight that the paper sleeves wouldn't fit in at all. the nickel and dime ones were so tight that after i filled the sleeves--a lot of unfolding smoothing trying again--they couldn't easily be slipped out. if you can see coins bouncing on my kitchen table and rolling hither and yon with me down on my hands and knees swallowing expletives you've got the picture. the only mold that wasn't defective was the quarter size and as this is the one that takes fewer coins than all the rest to fill up it is the least valuable in terms of time-saving. i waited at least a month after buying these before i sat down to roll all my coins so i didn't feel good about asking for my money back which is why i cannot share anything about this company's return policy that might help you decide whether or not to give them a try as it's possible i was simply unlucky and got sent a set of molds from a bad batch ",negative
" throughout the years i have used and owned many different versions of the brita pitcher water dispenser. all of these filtered water containers have been great. the only complaint i have ever had with these filters is size. the brita ultramax water filter dispenser was supposed to answer this problem. unfortunately due to bad design it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past brita products. pro: size: this water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water. (ironically this is really a disadvantage; as you will find below.) con(s): mold: if you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days you will get mold. this mold will probably make you ill (sore throat) (conversely if you look at it from another point of view - it will strengthen your immune system). to avoid this problem the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least (to safe you should wash it more often). i have never had this problem with brita's other products (i have friends who never washed their brita pitchers for months and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it). left over water: due to the faulty design of the product there will be left over water both above the filter and below it. besides turning the product upside down you cannot dispense all of the water. this is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product. not surprisingly this helps further contribute to mold growth. conclusion: save your money and buy brita's other well designed pitchers or even pure's pitchers. (the key word is pitcher.) you will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product ",negative

" almost immediately after i received this never-used pen i noticed that the ink does not dispense evenly. often it does not write on any surface. after i scratch the pen tip wildly for ~5 seconds it starts to write again. i've thrown it away because it is too inconvenient for use. however it is very cheap so maybe it's okay for someone who doesn't need to use a tiny pen too often ",negative

" when i first purchased the papermate phd multi i thought wow! what an awesome instrument. felt great in the hand and i iove the flow of the ink. very smooth. nice pencil and stylus as bonus! however because i liked the pen so much and used it every chance i got within 3 weeks the ink cartridge was empty. that's when my love of the pen began to falter. i opened the pen according to the package instructions and removed the ink cartridge. however it never worked the same again. the twist and click feature failed to hold the pen in the advanced position so whenever i would bear down to write it would retract and push up into the pen again. so i bought another thinking i must have done something wrong. carefully after the ink ran out in 2 weeks this time (guess i did more writing) i changed the cartridge again. same thing. at a high price tag ($8-9) for a plastic pen i bought a third and gave it one more try. same luck. so while i loved the feel and flow of the pen it is certainly not worth the price tag for a pen whose mechanisms housing and construction will only last a month. won't buy another one. three times and you're out.

" 1. it's a nice book and well priced. the mole is a pesky creature and deserves to be made into a book cover more than a cow does. 2. it's flaws: difficult to read because print color is so light. it fell apart at the end-page -spine junction. i sit on it (back pocket). packing tape repair seems to have solved the problem. it does not mark holidays on the page. there is an unreadable cryptic code on some pages which may be an attempt to do this. in any event i nearly forgot elvis' birthday ",negative
" i have owned this chair for about 9 months. the seat bottom has flattened out and has torn a bit -- i can see the polyfill inside. it is not particularly comfortable anymore. the chair also creaks a lot (as is typical with most inexpensive chairs). it's a lot of money for a chair that has the build quality of one of the cheapie leather chairs that can be had for under $50 ",negative
" i got this chair because i spend a lot of time on front of my home computer and i wanted a roomy chair that would allow me to move around some. i am tall six feet but not big 127 pounds and i have had this chair for less than six months and the leather is falling apart and the stuffing is coming out of the seat. i don't mind spending money to get a good chair but i cannot afford to be buying two chairs a year at this price.

" after much window shopping (research) i bought this chair two weeks ago and yesterday the thing fell apart while i was leaning back and watching a movie on my comp. here is the problem the back support is connected to the seat only by the two handle bars which are made of plastic. while i was leaning back one of the handles literally cracked open at the junctions where the bottom (right side) two screws are. i fell back wards head first but luckily my floor is carpetted and i did not hurt myself that much. the manufacturer rates this chair as big and tall (upto 250 pounds) and for 5 hours of daily usage. i weigh around 210 and i had been sitting on it for less than an hour when the incident happened. i am surely hoping to get my money back but the rest of you big and tall people beware ",negative

" i must admit i had no idea what they were but my daughter wanted them. i was disappointed that all you do is basically rub the pins together to get another color. this color did not last long so you had to keep doing that little process to get the colors to blend. my daughter who is 7 lost interest quickly. she uses them like regular markers. i could have paid 5 dollars for a new pack of markers. as for the material to use them on she used them all in a couple of hours.

" i purchased this mount to hang a 15 lcd tv weighing less than 9 pounds (the specifications rate it up to 33 lbs). i carefully measured and used a level to mount the swing arm on the wall but when i hung the tv the position of the arms and the small amount of give between the arm segments caused the tv to hang at a slight but noticable angle. you can tighten the arm segment joints which helps the problem somewhat but you won't be able to swing the arm around once tightened. the swivel adjustments only allow you to change the side-to-side angle and the vertical tilt there is no way to fix the rotation of the set.

" this ink has the ancient iron gall formula with its nifty aroma. iron gall ink is waterproof but not safe enough for writing checks. iron gall ink looks good from a wet-writing pen but the lower-priced lamy safari and al-star pens are not wet enough. also you should never let iron gall ink dry out in a pen (permanent clogging!) and you should flush an iron-gall-using pen in both directions with plain water (pulling water in and forcing water out) every month or so ",negative

" i bought two sharpeners. i sharpened about ten pencils with the first one (excellent sharpening while it lasted) and something let go inside. the motor ran but the rotating blade had no more power - as soon as i pressed the pencil into the blade it would stop turning while the motor continued running freely. i unwrapped the second sharpener to see if it would hold up better. again after about 10 pencils exactly the same thing happened. when i disassembled one of them to analyze the failure i discovered that a crucial area of the plastic gear that drives the blade mechanism was stripped away so that the gear was spinning practically freely. it was unable to drive the blade mechanism with any significant strength. conclusion: this product is potentially an excellent pencil sharpener but it has a major design weakness in its drive train. i only put one star on this review because zero stars is not available ",negative
" the idea behind the pasta machine for clay is brilliant and makes flattening the clay and gradiating the clay much easier however i bought 2 of these from my local craft store. the first started giving me trouble after about a week. the gears started to grind and black soot-like ash came out ( metal shavings?) i proceeded to take the face plates off and clean it figuring clay was stuck inside meanwhile my youngest liked it and wanted one of her own so while working on trying to clean and repair the first one i bought another. that one lasted 2 days. i brought them both back to the store. i am going to try the amaco brand and see if it is better ",negative
" the nib on this pen is far too broad. most fountain pen manufacturers would probably rate it medium. it does write a nice smooth line and it is conveniently disposable but it also looks very disposable. its appearance is less elegant even than most rollerball pens. if you are considering buying this pen because you like the elegance of fountain pens or for its fine point then this is not the pen for you. these were both major considerations for me and i was quite disappointed ",negative
" i'm very disappointed with this shredder. i got it back in october 2006 and i have only used it about 3 or 4 times. first of all although the product is supposed to shred up to 5 sheets at a time - it does not. it will get jammed so i only shred 1 or 2 sheets at a time. tonight i used it again and it became completely jammed from a few sheets. i cannot get it to work again. it is very loud and a bit slow but i can live with that i just don't like the fact that it jams after only using it a few times. i recommend others spend a few extra dollars and get a reliable shredder unlike the royal 5-sheet crosscut shredder ht500x ",negative
" this product worked ok for 3 months then the shredder began to fall apart. there are little finger like pieces (that are breaking off) underneath the shredding area which began to collect paper and cause the paper to backup and jammed in the shredding mechanism. the more fingers that fall off the faster paper backs up and gets jammed. so after every 10-15 pages i have to get out a pair of needlenose pliers and pull the impacted paper out of these tiny slots. it takes about 10 minutes of extreme frustration to unclog this clunker. that's about a minute a page. this is obviously completely unacceptable because if i had enough time to spend 1 minute to shred each piece of paper i would be paper mache artist. now i just use it to store paper until i buy a new shredder. this product was a complete disappointment for me ",negative
" i've gone through three shredders but this one is the worst. it's loud and jams easily. the others were loud and jammed too but this particular one lasted me only three months. when it jammed power automatically shutdown. i kept it in reverse and waited for power to come back about one to two hours later. i'm kinda ruthless with the shredders sticking papers with staplers tape or dried glue and i'm pretty impressed that the other shredders lasted so long. not this one it came from planet pms and work only when it was in the mood. i kept the baskets and placed one in each room. looking for the one i bought before this one. at least it lasted almost four years. wish me luck ",negative
" bought at a local builders warehouse super sale for $13 and the 1st time i used it i was amazed at the speed with one page so then i tried with five pages; it jammed and i had to reverse a few times. i finally got through that first batch but then it would not turn on automatically again. turns out the small limit switch that activates the shredder in the paper slot had gotten jammed backwards with the reversing. i was able to get it back in place and made it through two baskets of nicely shredded documents 2-3 pages at a time. a few weeks later it jammed again and it took awhile but i was finally able to reverse and forward to clear the jam. however the small cheaply made limit switch was no longer part of the unit (it apparently got shredded!) and now i have a nice $13 steel wastebasket so i cannot complain. bottom line: great for 1-2 pages at a time but forget junk mail with more than one page folded and still in the envelope unless you open unfold and feed 2-3 pages at a time ",negative

" at first i thought it difficult to justify the added expense for paper but you do get good quality. one reviewer comments on stains; but after buying and using 5 or 6 different moleskines i have to believe that was an exception that would have been replaced. i like the reporter style for writing quickly or with limited space but i like the bookmark that is on the standard notebooks ",positive
" i first encountered moleskine notebooks in a bookstore in london this spring and what lodged in my memory was their marketing claim to be the legendary notebook of hemingway et cetera. i have since learned from various sources that those claims may be a touch exaggerated. but now that i own one myself and am starting to make daily use of it i'm beginning to see at least why moleskine notebooks have so many fans. for more than ten years i've used a calendar/day planner/all-your-information-in-one-place system that isn't just a notebook but has an entire philosophy about how you're supposed to live your life tied into it. i never bought into that aspect of the company but have grown used to having one reference containing all that stuff between two covers and with a place for a pen besides. going from that to a moleskine with its one small pocket in the back and no place to put a writing instrument is definitely a switch. it's the part of the change i'm least sure about. on the other hand the moleskine definitely wins for portability ease of use style and handiness-to-have-around in case of brainstorms. so i'm still not completely sold that this is the best of all possible notebooks. but it's definitely a good one and i do appreciate both the attractiveness of the design and the quality of the construction. sure you can get a serviceable notebook for about a tenth of the price and a whole lifestyle system updated annually for quite a bit more. it's all a matter of taste and my taste is starting to run in this direction ",positive
" i bought the 3.5 x 5.5 ruled pocket version. by my standards the best notebook i've ever used. the perfect size for my jacket or pocket. acid free paper for long-term archival storage of my notes. good to use an acid free ink for even longer storage (gel ink pens do not work well with the moleskine's paper though). looks professional and i get a lot of nice comments about it. much easier to use than turning on my pda and slowly typing in notes with my thumbs. i also really like the fact that it will open completely flat on a table for easier note writing and reading. when this one is full i plan to buy another. price is higher than most but with this moleskine you pay for the quality ",positive
" love love love the moleskin notebooks in every size. so cool looking and just get cooler as they get beat up. my favorite size is the small one because i can carry it around in my bag so that i can scribble down any random thoughts throughout the day. one of my unexpectedly best purchases!

" i beat the hell out of everything i own. my pda which this has partially replaced has an aluminum hardshell case and a metal body. i have broken just every watch i have ever owned (and i have/had a few excellent watches). i am naturally hard on things due to my focus on life not on my gear. this little notebook has kept itself together so far while looking very hip. i am a software engineer/project manager and am cognisant of my technological options this is just faster lighter and thinner than my pda for scribbling notes. i am never without it in the office. the back folio pocket and the elastic strap looked dumb when i first bought it. however i use the folio pocket for receipts to be reimmbursed (better than leaving them in a pocket to be washed or thrown out)and the elastic strap serves double duty as a second bookmark and to keep the notebook together (keeping it closed helps it survive). i like the construction and archival quality of the book. my notes look more like those of a disorganized madman than a manager (i am starting to wonder if they are synonomous) but if i ever have to refer back to them i can be assured that they will be there for a long time. it only received 4 stars because they are [...] a piece and at my current scrawling rate i will probably need about 4 or 5 a year. just get your company to pay for it if you can because they are notebooks that you can rely on to be there for a long while. lastly: for the person who likes their montblanc notebook with tear out pages they are partially missing the point. these books are for archiving and keeping records (of questionable usefulness in my case) not for making quick throw away notes. i also highly doubt that their notebook is as thin as one of these is either. each have their own place ",positive
" i've dealt with all other kinds of pocket notebooks all of which fold deform get pages easily folded over and ripped out and stained. the moleskine is an elegant little solution that protects itself with a thin unobtrusive cover and a small elastic strap which has avoided every other problem that's plagued previous notebooks. i would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive ",positive

" last year i bought the gray female version of the art s. buck artist's model and i was very very happy with it. it was an enormous improvement on the old wooden models i grew up with. it is detailed in a way that the old wooden mannequins never were and it is flexible enough to put into an accurate full-lotus position complete with the detail of having the backs of the feet resting on the thighs and that is scary bendy. the only problem with it is that the neck joint although providing a good range of motion is very delicate and broke not long after i bought it. now this is not the end of the world if you have the right tools. i used a dremel moto-tool to cut out the remnant of the original joint and to grind the head off of a narrow nail which i then heated holding it with a pair of pliers and inserted into the upper torso to make a hole and then into the bottom of the neck: problem solved. the end result is still just as flexible as when it came out of the box with the exception of the neck's motion being limited to rotation from side to side. apparently this flaw is known to sideshow toys who released a new second version of the model in two sexes and three colors. the new series has a caucasian female figure that is not *quite* as flexible as the original--among other things the detailed full-lotus is pretty much out of the question--and it is more voluptous having larger breasts a heavier body broader thighs and a much stronger neck. also both mannequins have heads that seem just slightly out of proportion with the body... just slightly larger than they should be. be all that as it may the original gray pictured in the above listing and offered at a ten percent discount under list is the real thing: skinnier and far more flexible than the current model but having a flaw which makes it something of a compromise; making you choose between the genuinely superior flexibility of the original mannequin (which you may eventually have to repair) or seeking out the newer model which exchanges flexibility for sturdiness while adding features that can be summed up by the term sex-appeal. i have both models and after performing the necessary repair i prefer the original gray and highly recommend it with the caveat that you must be very careful while handling it unless you are willing to and able to perform a fairly easy repair. i could perform it and i did which is why i rate this item as highly as i do: all in all you can call the original gray an excellent product with a small repairable flaw. your mileage may vary ",positive

" quite handy for sketching and doodling anywhere. sturdy pages accept some light watercolor washes ink and dry media. pages lay flat thanks to the style of binding so it's easy to work a two-page spread of 5 1/2 x 7 1/2. the expanding pocket in the back cover is handy for storing train ticket stubs show tickets receipts and business cards (the phone numbers and addresses of good restaurants or shops discovered while exploring during trips sometimes come in well-desinged colorful formats that can be used to make collages or decorate journals). a bit pricey but they are the just right size to fit on any pocket and strongly bound to preserve notes and sketches through the rigors of travel ",positive

" last year i bought the gray female version of the art s. buck artist's model and i was very very happy with it. it was an enormous improvement on the old wooden models i grew up with. it is detailed in a way that the old wooden mannequins never were and it is flexible enough to put into an accurate full-lotus position complete with the detail of having the backs of the feet resting on the thighs and that is scary bendy. the only problem with it is that the neck joint although providing a good range of motion is very delicate and broke not long after i bought it. now this is not the end of the world if you have the right tools. i used a dremel moto-tool to cut out the remnant of the original joint and to grind the head off of a narrow nail which i then heated holding it with a pair of pliers and inserted into the upper torso to make a hole and then into the bottom of the neck: problem solved. the end result is still just as flexible as when it came out of the box with the exception of the neck's motion being limited to rotation from side to side. apparently this flaw is known to sideshow toys who released a new second version of the model in two sexes and three colors. the new series has a caucasian female figure that is not *quite* as flexible as the original--among other things the detailed full-lotus is pretty much out of the question--and it is more voluptous having larger breasts a heavier body broader thighs and a much stronger neck. also both mannequins have heads that seem just slightly out of proportion with the body... just slightly larger than they should be. be all that as it may the original gray pictured in the above listing and offered at a ten percent discount under list is the real thing: skinnier and far more flexible than the current model but having a flaw which makes it something of a compromise; making you choose between the genuinely superior flexibility of the original mannequin (which you may eventually have to repair) or seeking out the newer model which exchanges flexibility for sturdiness while adding features that can be summed up by the term sex-appeal. i have both models and after performing the necessary repair i prefer the original gray and highly recommend it with the caveat that you must be very careful while handling it unless you are willing to and able to perform a fairly easy repair. i could perform it and i did which is why i rate this item as highly as i do: all in all you can call the original gray an excellent product with a small repairable flaw. your mileage may vary ",positive
" i like these notebooks very much. the cover is very sturdy and the pages have a nice weight to them. the size is perfect for your back pocket or jacket. i use these books to jot down notes from meetings with clients. the small pocket in the rear of the book is handy for storing business cards ",positive
" at first i thought it difficult to justify the added expense for paper but you do get good quality. one reviewer comments on stains; but after buying and using 5 or 6 different moleskines i have to believe that was an exception that would have been replaced. i like the reporter style for writing quickly or with limited space but i like the bookmark that is on the standard notebooks ",positive
" i first encountered moleskine notebooks in a bookstore in london this spring and what lodged in my memory was their marketing claim to be the legendary notebook of hemingway et cetera. i have since learned from various sources that those claims may be a touch exaggerated. but now that i own one myself and am starting to make daily use of it i'm beginning to see at least why moleskine notebooks have so many fans. for more than ten years i've used a calendar/day planner/all-your-information-in-one-place system that isn't just a notebook but has an entire philosophy about how you're supposed to live your life tied into it. i never bought into that aspect of the company but have grown used to having one reference containing all that stuff between two covers and with a place for a pen besides. going from that to a moleskine with its one small pocket in the back and no place to put a writing instrument is definitely a switch. it's the part of the change i'm least sure about. on the other hand the moleskine definitely wins for portability ease of use style and handiness-to-have-around in case of brainstorms. so i'm still not completely sold that this is the best of all possible notebooks. but it's definitely a good one and i do appreciate both the attractiveness of the design and the quality of the construction. sure you can get a serviceable notebook for about a tenth of the price and a whole lifestyle system updated annually for quite a bit more. it's all a matter of taste and my taste is starting to run in this direction ",positive
" i bought the 3.5 x 5.5 ruled pocket version. by my standards the best notebook i've ever used. the perfect size for my jacket or pocket. acid free paper for long-term archival storage of my notes. good to use an acid free ink for even longer storage (gel ink pens do not work well with the moleskine's paper though). looks professional and i get a lot of nice comments about it. much easier to use than turning on my pda and slowly typing in notes with my thumbs. i also really like the fact that it will open completely flat on a table for easier note writing and reading. when this one is full i plan to buy another. price is higher than most but with this moleskine you pay for the quality ",positive
" love love love the moleskin notebooks in every size. so cool looking and just get cooler as they get beat up. my favorite size is the small one because i can carry it around in my bag so that i can scribble down any random thoughts throughout the day. one of my unexpectedly best purchases! ",positive
" i beat the hell out of everything i own. my pda which this has partially replaced has an aluminum hardshell case and a metal body. i have broken just every watch i have ever owned (and i have/had a few excellent watches). i am naturally hard on things due to my focus on life not on my gear. this little notebook has kept itself together so far while looking very hip. i am a software engineer/project manager and am cognisant of my technological options this is just faster lighter and thinner than my pda for scribbling notes. i am never without it in the office. the back folio pocket and the elastic strap looked dumb when i first bought it. however i use the folio pocket for receipts to be reimmbursed (better than leaving them in a pocket to be washed or thrown out)and the elastic strap serves double duty as a second bookmark and to keep the notebook together (keeping it closed helps it survive). i like the construction and archival quality of the book. my notes look more like those of a disorganized madman than a manager (i am starting to wonder if they are synonomous) but if i ever have to refer back to them i can be assured that they will be there for a long time. it only received 4 stars because they are [...] a piece and at my current scrawling rate i will probably need about 4 or 5 a year. just get your company to pay for it if you can because they are notebooks that you can rely on to be there for a long while. lastly: for the person who likes their montblanc notebook with tear out pages they are partially missing the point. these books are for archiving and keeping records (of questionable usefulness in my case) not for making quick throw away notes. i also highly doubt that their notebook is as thin as one of these is either. each have their own place ",positive
" i've dealt with all other kinds of pocket notebooks all of which fold deform get pages easily folded over and ripped out and stained. the moleskine is an elegant little solution that protects itself with a thin unobtrusive cover and a small elastic strap which has avoided every other problem that's plagued previous notebooks. i would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive ",positive
" this notebook is fabulous...its history inspires. i think that it will be the last type of notebook i use for my journaling and writing. i adore it ",positive
" i've been having trouble finding avery 3297 dark t-shirt transfers in any local store. for some peculiar reason staples and office depot carry many packets of the light fabric transfers which are worthless (they fall apart after the slightest use and the colors run when washed) but never more than 3 or 4 of the really terrific dark fabric transfers. i can't give enough praise for these heavier plastic opaque transfers for dark colors and use them regardless of the color of fabric. as a military veteran and political activist i use them for peace rallies and marches and have made flags banners shoulder and cap patches--even an occasional t-shirt! highly recommend them but where are they in the stores? some managers tell me they were cleaned out during the christmas season and i now suspect that the recent store stock has been bought up by other political activists getting reading for our rally and march in washington dc on jan 27. if you're an activist think about how you can use them. ps: i always hand-wash all my finished products in cool or lukewarm water and have had no problems with colors running. just be sure the design is thoroughly ironed on!

" i am very pleased with my moleskin small address book. i can fully appreciate why picasso and hemingway used the moleskin notebooks. the quality of material used to produced my address book is clearly of the highest that can be found. what i especially liked about my small moleskin address book is that the pages are ruled for you to use as you like unlike other books that have designated space for street addresses or phone number. as you know sometimes all you want to do it keep the phone number while with other contacts you want to keep a biography on them their birthdates their children's birthdates anniversary email addresses etc. i think its a perfect address book. i liked it so much i bought three one for my mom my sister and myself. ",positive
" this is the best handbag-size address book. discreet sexy all grown up. i bought my first one in italy and will continue to buy more (because i never write in pencil! ",positive
" i discovered moleskine notebooks in london about two months ago and bought my first a small ruled notebook about one month ago. it's not taken me long to become a convert to these little gems since i've now bought my second moleskine the small address book. the address book wasn't entirely what i was expecting but that's a good thing. it is almost identical to the small ruled notebook except for alphabetized tabs along the page edges. unlike most address books there are no neat boxes to fill in with names street addresses and city/state/zip; no separate spaces for home work and cell numbers. there are only ... lines. what this means of course is that you can record whatever information you choose to however you choose to. a person can be tucked into one line or have an entire page for herself. moleskine makes a big deal about its notebooks being tools for the self-expression of the people who use them and i was very pleasantly surprised to see that this philosophy extends even into the usually-mundane world of the address book. i didn't expect to have such a positive reaction to this product but that's what happened ",positive
" nothing compares to these awesome notebooks. you'll never go back to the office supply variety after you've used one of these ",positive
" i write with noodler's black (the brand's standard black ink) almost every day because i can't always choose the paper to write on. noodler's black can be used for two-sided writing on bad paper even newsprint which is rare among all the fountain pen inks in the world. i also write with noodler's black because it's waterproof forgery-proof good-looking and pleasantly smooth during writing. i confidently write checks with noodler's black and it is safe for signing valuable or important documents too (when black is an acceptable color; ask your lawyer). please keep in mind that the noodler's company carefully says which of the brand's colors are waterproof and which are not. in my experience noodler's black is by far the best noodler's color for writing on both sides of bad paper. one behavior you might notice if your pen's nib is an exposed metal surface (not covered with colored enamel) is that noodler's (standard) black spreads itself over exposed metal surfaces. this nib creep is harmless behavior because the ink doesn't run down onto the grip area. wiping the ink off the nib is only temporary; more ink will soon spread to replace what you wiped off. again this is harmless behavior and a very small price to pay for the security of your marks signatures and important handwritten texts ",positive
" over the last 10+ yrs. i have owned 4 laptops one burnt my leg and the others overheated. this marvelous device lets your laptop breathe. if you own a laptop this is a must!! ",positive
" the xpad is exactly as described ... non-slip surface eliminates heat transfer between my legs and my laptop elevates my laptop to allow proper airflow...and it fits easily into my laptop bag. the product is stable without being bulky or heavy and it doesn't interfere with my unit's internal cooling system ",positive
" the x-pad is a decent piece of equipment doing a good job of keeping my laptop from getting too hot. my only issue with it is the lack of padding on the underside. i'm going to have to attach a piece of neoprene or something similar to make it more comfortable to have on my lap. ",positive
" keeps my wife's and my laptop running cool without any fans. my comp internal fan rarely runs when using xpad ",positive
" i like this cooler/heatshield much better then the one i had previously. it keeps the laptop much cooler and is easier to transport when i am traveling ",positive
" the xpad definitely is effective but seems a bit overpriced for what it is - plastic housing with foam insulation. i use it with a tabletpc and need to tilt the entire laptop up to use sometimes. when doing so it's not totally non-slip but is manageable. also it has a very strong plastic smell that hopefully will dissipate over time. some reviews describe the xpad as having metal edges but that's not the case at least not in the current design. the edges are made of the same abs hard plastic as the top of the pad. i don't find the edges to be uncomfortable but suppose they could be made more rounded to improve the design ",positive
" i was looking for a nice heatshield that did not use usb or drain energy from my laptop battery. this thing works great! i wouldn't hesitate to buy this ",positive
" since the phileas came out a number of years ago i've had 4 of them (3 fountain and 1 roller ball). these fountain pens have never let me down and have always been sound in quality. the first was the original red and blue series the others were later blue and green marble models. they look nice and write very well. many fountain pen users regard the phileas series as the best place to start with fountain pens and i agree with that. they're easy to clean easy to use and mine have always been ready to write for me. i whole heartedly suggest this pen as a fine addition to any pen collection as well as for a nice fountain pen to use on a daily basis ",positive
" the waterman phileas fountain pen is a wonder. smooth writing well built nice weight and balance it's a heck of a pen for the price (always $40 or less if you shop around). i have more expensive pens older pens but this is the pen i use more than half the time. at its price i'm not afraid to carry it with me for fear of losing or damaging it. the cartridges are huge. great buy. ",positive
" i've been using cross pens since i returned to my fountain pen roots several years ago but i decided to try this model because of its gorgeous design. there are aspects of it that i like better. the cartridges are longer unlike the smaller cross ones that run out much quicker and never seem to drain completely. it was also ready to go as soon as the cartridge was inserted unlike the cross which seem to be stubborn to get started. it has a nice feel to it ergonomically and i nice feel to the nib on the paper. ",positive
" i bought this pen recently and i really like the attractiveness of the pen. i believe this goes well for either a man or a woman. the pen writes very smoothly and offers you a quality pen at a reasonable price ",positive
" yeah i found out the hard way about the non-waterproofness of it...i was using my fountain pen to write in a lab notebook and as will happen in labs water got on it...kinda fails the point of lab notebooks which is to document permanently what you do. going to go drop a bit more money on waterproof ink. interestingly my accidental paper chromatogram revealed that the black ink separates into blue and yellow pigments. i'm a little annoyed about this as i used quink before and it seemed to be at least somewhat water-resistant. that bottle i got back in malaysia so it might be a different formulation ",positive
" this ink is popular with fountain pen enthusiasts. permanent only means not washable with plain water. it is not waterproof and it is not safe for writing checks ",positive
" this product is excellent. it will make it much easier on your back and also time efficient. ",positive
" i like the size and look of the planner. the format is great too with days of the week on the left side and lined pages ont the right side. it's lightweight and you can carry it with you almost everywhere...even in a purse. but the paper is too thin. if i use any pen i can see what i have written on the other side. not worth the amount i paid for with shipping and handling. better to go to a store and see and feel your planner and then decide if you want to purchase it ",positive
" i don't keep regular hours. so i don't want a book that goes from say 8 to 6 or whatever. this great moleskine lets you track time the way you work. you can plan your week and make lots of notes on the right hand side. i love moleskine. i write a lot with a fountain pen and the moleskine paper is great for fountain pens. it's the finest paper you can buy. and this is a nice buttery soft leather book. it's not too small or too large. i keep mine on my desk but often take it from room to room as needed. or in the car. you can't go wrong with this book. and you never go wrong with moleskine. it's always worth the extra cost ",positive
" a friend of mine had this planner and when i saw it i knew i just had to have it! it's great because i can keep track of my week on one side and then make my 'to do' lists or keep notes on the otherside of the page. i recommend this planner to everyone ",positive
" bought this for a birthday present. feedback from by two grandchildren was very positive. they liked it very much ",positive
" i had purchased a levenger palm pilot and writing pad case which came with loops for a pen and pencil but did not come with any appropriately sized for the compact case. therefore i looked online for mini pens that were stylish compact enough for my case inexpensive and could be refilled. these definitely meet all of my criteria ",positive
" ever need a pen or pencil? with this little set they are always available. i can't tell you how many times i pull these out and everyone has favorable comments. the trouble is you can't hardly find these in the states. i got mine in canada. i don't know why more office supply stores in the states don't carry these because everyone likes them when they see them. very durable except the pens don't make it through the wash. you'll need to buy a refill and probably have to pour alcohol on the pen housing to remove the ink that flowed out in the wash. after a good cleaning and a new refill you're good to go. the pencil will make it through the wash with no problem. several times. :) check your pockets before doing the wash. these babies will disappear faster than a toddler who just learned how to walk. they're harder to keep track of than your cell phone pda or keys; but you won't want to be without them after you get used to having them around. you'll find yourself carrying these every day ",positive
" until you take one out to lend somebody nobody even knows you have these pens. i've carried a red pen a black pen and a mechanical pencil for 5 years now every day even when i'm not wearing a shirt with a pocket and have to wear them in my buttons under my tie. these things are so small and lightweight that i usually have to hunt for them in the laundry. indeed the only times they have failed on me is failing to make it through the wash. small sleek stylish and cheap who could ask for more ",positive

" the avery tripleclick is the best value stylus pen combination i've found. while i don't find the pencil particularly useful it is occasionally handy. the pen is comfortable to write with and the price is hard to beat. the only minor problems with it are: 1) the difficulty of finding one retail. since amazon offers it that's no longer a problem. 2) the little cap over the eraser. it tends to come off and get lost. 3) the silver paint tends to eventually wear off leaving the white plastic underneath. i wish they offered it in black or some other plastic color without the silver paint. none of these is a show-stopper ",positive
" the refills do well. i just wish they didn't run out so quick ",positive
" as a senior adult with both arthritis and parkinson's disease i need all the help i can get. my handwriting has become virtually impossible to read because it is so small. trying to read my grocery list in the grocery store is sometimes a real guessing game. the pen again writing stylus is a real help. i am still adjusting to the new finger placement but i do believe it is an advantage ",positive

" thankfully moleskine has returned to the 2004 and earlier format in the weekly pages. the vertical columns apparently a short-lived experiment for 2005 are gone and replaced by the signifcantly better horizontal spaces for each day. moleskine makes great products. the planner is well-constructed and will survive a year of heavy use with ease. the small size makes it ideal for a purse or briefcase. the hardcover adds protection and the pockets add functionality. the are perfect for slipping in a phone number or business card to keep handy. it is a classy simple way to keep track of dates and appointments. my only wish is that the text could be slightly darkened on the pages to stand out more. i have been a longtime user of the moleskine notebook and will continue to be one for years to come ",positive
" if you didn't like the new layout in the 2005 edition you'll be happy to know that the 2006 edition has gone back to the old layout (2004 and earlier). i didn't mind it myself. mainly i like the size of the whole thing - it's an inch shorter than other pocket calendars so it actually fits in my pocket without sticking out too much ",positive

" i tried lots of other brands. store brands are generally cheaper for daily printing needs. compared to others (staples office max etc) i think office depot's 24lb white printing paper is better both in terms of quality and price. i buy these to print stuff for myself maps emails etc. and they work fine. but if you want to print something for business purposes to submit or give someone else job applications you wouldn't want this one. you need something at least 28 lbs in that case. but using heavy paper for daily printing is not really environmental friendly. that's why i prefer light weight ones. i had tried 20lbs too but really believe me if you have an injet printer you wouldn't want to print on a 20 lb paper. that's why 24lbs is the optimum at least for me ",positive
" sorry...no offense intended but the kid's review is well... having used this paper for years i can attest to its superb quality. dollar for dollar this is probably the best value out there! virtually no print-through: perfect for double-sided pages (i even print my desktop-published textbooks on it!). for the price you simply cannot go wrong with this stock.

" does your bank now refuse to count coins? you can buy funnels or counters or just load these sleeves yourself. i carry a tube of quarters around in my purse for the car wash (it needs $5 in quarters.) i also take these to my bank. if you have kids this is fun; get them to count out and load the sleeves. you will be surprised how much coin you have at home; it can add up to a nice dinner out for the whole family ",positive
" i gave these to my staff for christmas presents and everyone loved them. you can always use a card and a lot of times you forget to go out and buy them ",positive
" my wife uses these cards in conjunction with her printmaster program to create a variety of greeting cards. she really loves this product as it has an integral pre-fold crease which facilitates a pefect fold after printing ",positive
" my recent order of avery half-fold greeting cards was a good price and good quality ",positive
" i completely agree with the previous review. while i certainly don't think the cards should be classified as heavyweight (they most definitely are not) the texture is very nice and the printing on them is excellent (i love our canon i860 printer. if you're shopping around for a new printer i would highly recommend it). happy cardmaking ",positive
" these cards are overall a good deal. they work best for invitations announcements and other times when you will be doing mass mailings. they are a little too flimsy for my liking for nicer individual cards despite avery advertising them as &quot;heavyweight&quot; on the box. that's the only reason i give them four stars instead of five. other than that these are great cards; i haven't had problems with smearing or paperjams at all. the cards are scored evenly and fold very easily. the texture is a nice touch too ",positive
" great item i will spend the money for an item that writes like this on ",positive
" i am very pleased with this pencil/pens/stylus. i actually got the neon color of this kind of pencil/pens/stylus. it is very easy to use. my brother got one and the year before he got one without the stylus. i am very happy with this product and more people should go for steadtler products ",positive
" this writing instrument is great for college students especially for note-taking. it is a great convenience to have a pencil two different colored pens and a highlighter all in one hand. this is a perfect gift for the coming holiday season ",positive
" i bought this pen for myself ... i'm an accountant and love having the pencil and three colors of ink (one bright orange for highlighting) all in one unit. my husband saw this pen and couldn't believe i didn't order him one so i'm back ordering another ",positive
" this parker pen especially with the optional gel refill is a stylish classy pen that looks at least as good as some of those other more expensive pens and writes very well with very little leakage. as a left hander i also appreciate the quick drying ink and the left-handed friendliness of the pen. the pen is also quite durable and the refills are readily available at most office stores. incidentally the pens are made in thesame u.k. factory that manufactured valentine pens with the same quality. this pen lives up to its legacy unlike some of those other pens that have become nothing but cheaply made expensively priced knock-offs of themselves. oh and by the way these cost a tenth of the price of those other pens. this pen the pilot g7 and its family of products and the pentel energel are my big three at this point. ",positive
" - the barrel of this pen is all stainless steel which looks nice but feels slippery as you're trying to write. parker makes the same pen with a plastic barrel which is easier to grip but looks less sleek. in other words there is a tradeoff between looks and functionality in my opinion. this is an excellent pen in every other way with solid build quality sturdy clip and confident push-button mechanism. parker's ballpoint refill which was reformulated sometime around 2002 is the best i've used beating montblanc pelikan cross papermate and bic ballpoint refills in terms of smoothness consistency and smudge resistance. for me this pen (with plastic barrel) is the ideal ballpoint for everyday all-purpose use. ",positive
" i discovered parker stainless steel ballpoints as i was finishing up graduate school in the mid 1980s. i was first attracted by the stainless ballpoint's classic stylish looks. (i prefer the gold click & clip model but have also used the complete silver model with pleasure.) until my discovery of parkers i had used pilots papermates shaffers and crosses with varying degrees of success. (i left cross pens due to their excessive costs. shaffers easily brake. pilot and papermate inks soon fade to invisibility!) i have been using and recommending parkers ever since. parker's stainless ballpoint is sturdy and durable. i have used them to print of course and to point pry and pound. never have i permanently damaged one. (with excessive torque parker stainless pens will bend. i have re-straightened parkers with vice grips.) parker stainless ballpoints are rugged and take considerable abuse and keep on working. (once the internal plastic clicker malfunctioned for the only mishap i've ever experienced with a parker.) i also like parker's ink formula. i began my career with blue medium and later moved to black fine. for the past 15 years i have used parker's fine blue. the refills cost between 10% and 50% less than the cross pen refills (depending on the vendor). parker ink dries quickly (rarely leaving a smudge under left-handers). it doesn't wobble (i.e. floating away from the point of application) as does some pithy contemporary inks. parker ink has brilliant color is attractive and easy to read. i've notice over the years that parker ink does not fade. twenty year old journal entries tax records and business notes are not faded to date. (i've become curious about how long parker ink will perform.) i have given parker stainless ballpoints as gifts awarded them for achievement and presented them with gratitude. they are excellent gift candidates. (others have always been impressed with this pen's classic beauty and the parker name.) if you are in the market for a nice looking sturdy pen with ink that doesn't wobble or fade i suggest you try the parker stainless ballpoint. amazon.com's price is excellent. get yours soon. ",positive
" i've owned many pens over the years expensive and cheap but this parker stands out as my everyday favorite. yes a mount blanc is fine but i've never felt comfortable carrying one around in everday work since i could lose it. the parker on the other hand is like a good pair of blue jeans--comfortable and accessible. additionally the styling will grow on you--it's unpretentious yet refined. a true classic ",positive
" i purchsed this for use with the multiple moleskine notebooks i use. i bought one to try and will buy more to keep them with all my moleskines. the pen is sturdy and big enough to fit comfortably in my hand but small enough to clip onto a notebook spine and still fit easily in a pcket. great product for anyone who needs to carry a pen but can't or doesn't want to mess with a regular sized pen or pencil. the stylus tip on the back end is nice for pda users as well ",positive
" i use this pen in my checkbook. i can write positive values in black and negative in red. also if i'm not sure of an exact amount i can pencil it in temporarily. all this and unlike some similar products it is still slim enough to fit in the checkbook. the only drawback i can see is that the pencil is .7mm instead of .5mm ",positive
" this is a nice black ink. it feels good during writing. it is popular among fountain pen enthusiasts. it is not for writing on both sides of bad paper. it is not very water-resistant and it is not safe for writing checks or signing important documents ",positive
" these cartridges contain waterman's reliable black ink. they flow well and the ink dries fairly quickly. they're very convenient as they just snap in. but the biggest advantage is the large size. they fit inside the waterman fountain pens but are much bigger than other fountain pen cartridges. they last longer and the ink flows better than many brands i've tried. i can totally suggest these for any waterman fountain pen user who wants a convenient ink source. also be sure to check out florida blue and blue-black if you like other colors ",positive

" my expensive pens were always getting stolen at the office but i wanted a good pen at an attractive price. the parker pen 'jotter' fit the bill. these pens work very well and look great. they last a long time and are refillable. i'm sold on these pens and they are solid values ",positive
" light-weight pen with no sharp edges to ruin your pockets with. i have had one for a long time use it constantly & nothing has gone wrong with it. feels good in your hand. i don't like to carry a purse so am always looking for products that are useful light-weight smooth & small that fit inside my coat pockets. this is it in a pen ",positive
" cross pens are a real favorite and i have one pen with a cat on it that i call my lucky pen because i've been writing with it for years and i seem to write better with a cross pen filled with a medium blue refill. the price you pay for the pleasure of smooth writing is that now and then the ink will ball up on the pen tip and you have to roll it off onto some paper. i normally find some ink on my hands after using the new refills and the problem may be that i'm writing for so long and the pen has become warm. even with this issue the writing seems perfect and the ink is a soft sapphire easy on the eyes and the pen writes like a dream. i'm writing out all my recipes with these refills and they look wonderful. writing with a cross pen always feels a little more luxurious and then pen has lasted for years. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" this cartridge is lamy's proprietary cartridge; it isn't guaranteed to fit in other pens and other brands of cartridges are not guaranteed to fit in lamy pens. this is a lighter black ink and many fountain pen enthusiasts enjoy the variation-in-density effect of writing with lighter black inks. this ink is not very water resistant and it is not safe for writing checks ",positive
" the refull cartridge is what makes this lamy a real fountain pen. you're supposed to be able to refill them not chuck and replace some bit of plastic with alarming frequency. i loathe the idea of disposable fountain pens -- although i admit i have used them. so i was pleased to be able to aquire an easy to operate lamy relill device. they should be standard issue ",positive
" i have used bic and papermate ballpoint pens for years. however i finally got tired of them not working half the time. i was at my doctors office one day and used the girls pen at the front desk to sign in. she had this pilot g-2 gel pen. i loved the way it wrote and the way it felt in my hand. it has a rubber grip and you can see when you are running low on ink. it writes the first time and evertime right out of the package. not at all like the bic and other ballpoint pens. i am hooked i will never go back to ballpoint pens again. i bought mine at wal-mart for $2.50 for a two pack. they also have the refills for them also. unless you write a bunch these two will last a long while before you need to buy refills for them. they came in red black blue and other colors also. i got the blue extra fine point. i highly recommend these gel pens. ",positive
" i love this thing. caught all my friends on video getting the stuff scared out of them. = ",positive
" i bought this product for fun and it worked out almost perfectly. the only let down is that there is no push to talk feature but it's still a great product. it's small lightweight and loud just like the product description says. people's expressions are well worth the 30 bucks it cost after shipping. i highly recommend it ",positive
" stylish small lightweight loud. got it for my father. the look on my mothers face when he opened was worth 10x the price of this gem ",positive
" i love this set of cards. so many beautiful unique cards that will really make an impact. the organizer is such a great concept and can be used forever... just go out and buy new cards to replace those that you've used in a category. as another reviewer reports there is a lack of male cards and most cards are on the feminine side... but that probably is more telling of the population that gives cards! i bought my set at costco where the price was much lower fifteen dollars! a great deal if you are able to snag them there ",positive
" the cards are beautiful and reflect the care that was taken to design and assemble them. there is a good variety of colors and styles. however there is a lack of cards appropriate for male recipients. the cards are mostly for female recipients. nonetheless it's a great product and i enjoy giving these cards to others for special occasions ",positive
" this ink is the best that i have ever written with. i do a lot of writing editing scoring etc. and i need a pen and ink that can withstand and hold up; this one does the job and does it exceptionally ",positive
" i try not to be too materialist a person and am seldom afflicted with object lust. but as a long-time anglophile and newly-minted moleskine addict when i read about the then-forthcoming city notebook series and specifically the london edition my initial reaction could be described as: waaaaaannnnt! after what seemed like a very long wait this product finally showed up here and i can say it fulfills all my expectations. it is not only to my mind the perfect medium for memorializing my sabbatical trip to the uk last spring but it's also a great tool for collecting ideas for what to do on my (hopefully not-too-long-from-now) return trip. and it will be a most handy resource to have while i'm there. before during after. if that makes the moleskine city notebook sound like the swiss army knife of guidebooks that is intentional. the idea that drives this notebook is captured in the quotation from aldous huxley's 1925 essay collection along the road that's printed on the moleskine's second page: for any traveler who has any taste of his own the only useful guide-book will be the one which he himself has written. the london city notebook contains a comprehensive set of maps (with index) followed by a bunch of blank pages and a section of tabbed pages with interesting icons. perforated pages allow for handy notes and reminders and there are also tracing pages for your itineraries and whatever. the reliable moleskine back pocket contains label stickers for creating your own tabbed sections and to help you remember where you wrote things there are three bookmark ribbons instead of the usual single one. london and moleskine have a special connection for me because it was in a fairly well-known legal and business bookstore on high holborn where i saw a moleskine display for the first time. i'm looking forward to filling this one with memories notes and references from that first trip and starting to put together thoughts for what to do the next time. as guidebooks go i will definitely give the one which i myself have written pride of place on my travel bookshelf ... and if i make plans for paris or amsterdam say then their city notebooks will show up there too ",positive
" i bought a cross pen and when i ran out of refills i went to a local store that sold cross. they told me that i could use another brand of ink and everything would be just fine. well it wasn't. it was of the wrong consistency and my pen ran and ran. so i finally found these and my pen is right as rain now ",positive
" this ink is the same as pelikan 4001 brilliant black. the cartridge shapes for a. t. cross and pelikan fountain pens are different so pay attention if you're ordering cartridges. pelikan 4001 ink bottles come in two sizes while a. t. cross ink bottles come only in the larger size. this ink is a true black (unlike some black fountain pen inks) and it is very smooth to write with too. it is not very water-resistant and it is not safe for writing checks ",positive
" i purchased this about a month ago and am not dissapointed! i have a desk job and sit all day. my desk is old and the chair cannot reach high enough so my arms are in the proper position. i have always had neck and shoulder pain from sitting improperly. this cushion straightens out my posture so everything is in proper alignment. i have not had any back or shoulder pain since i got this. highly recommended for desk jobs ",positive
" i have been looking for an weekly planner forever!!!! and yes this is a little more expensive than your normal office planner but when you think that you will be using it every day for the whole year its very worth it! i love the rubber band that keeps all my bits of paper together. the letters on the papers are very light which gives one the sense of having blank pages on which to write on. its perfect size to take around and very low-key. it is very personal and yet practical. i am just thankful that i don't have to search for a new planner every year as i have already found this one ",positive
" does what it was designed to do. i think that the mainboard could have been made of another material such as plastic. the current material can deform in humid conditions if under some weight or pressure ",positive
" this is my very first experience with a trimmer. i was aiming to the plastic made products with the replaceable cutters but i recall my school had an old beat up trimmer and it seemed to still cut good. so i went with the wooden type and self-sharpening blade. the quality is great. it's very light to carry. plus it cuts perfect ",positive
" this is a great product for anyone wanting to be able to cut with precision and avoid the $200+ price tags! this is a much lower priced product and it is far superior to the smaller razor blade trimmers ",positive
" it is slim and perfect size for a purse or pocket. i like the calendar in the front and the notched half circles for ease in finding pages. good service too ",positive
" i just bought this fountain pen because i missed writing with one since elementary school when we were required to use them. it is quite nice for the price and as all foutain pens an instant handwriting enhancer ",positive
" bought a cheap cross many years ago just to see if i liked fountain pens. cheap it was and my interest died. desperate for stocking stuffer ideas i put this on my wish list after reading the wopping two other reviews. writes very well and seems well built and durable. as a fountain pen novice i didn't realize the ink was not waterproof - d'oh! i need durable ink. bought the converter (available on amazon) and noodlers bullet proof black both direct from worldlux site. works great - ink's topsoil ran under the tap but that's all. the writing remains and highly legible. no instructions for any of the above but all fairly idiot proof. bottom line: a quality introduction to fountain pens at a reasonable price ",positive
" after my 20+ year old cross classic black fountain pen had worn out i was looking around for a replacement. it's finish had been worn smooth the gold was not as shiny as new and the ink would not feed well. i considered some very expensive pens but remembered how i'd inwardly cringe when someone would say hey can i borrow your pen for a sec? i'd have to give some some instruction to avoid the grind and jamb scenario that occured first time i lent it out years ago. ouch! armed with that criteria i looked at several utilitarian pens including the waterman phileas. the reviews were about equal but the stealth fighter looks of the lamy won out in the end. does it write as smoothly as my cross? in a word: no... however it does lay down a nice line and doesn't scratch. i would compare the line to the pilot v2 .07 gel pens i've been using lately. as with with most fountain pens it does give the act of writing that mystical feel that you don't get from cheap pens. i'm looking forward to getting to know my new pen ",positive
" the pen is really great. i'm a big fan of the gel pens but they smudge really easy even after they dry for a couple seconds. the pen also writes very nice. its different to work with a pen that has some square edges. its easy to over come. the pen is rather expensive but its great that the refills are inexpensive ",positive
" i have an ipaq that i love but the stylus storage awkward. seems to work sell in all modes and love the ergo design ",positive
" great multi pen. no need to carry a bunch of pens pencils styluses.. all in one unit. the best part for me is the thickness. my stylus was so thin is gave me cramps. i can use this with no pain. highly recommended ",positive
" i discovered them in europe years ago and was very happy to find them here. i use almost all their notebooks specially the small pocket type with squared paper. they are practical and elegant. i carry them with me everywhere for taking notes drawing and designing. the planners are my favorite agendas. since i prefer the weekly planner because it is compact the integration of a single ruled notebook page between pages in the 2007 model that actually permits you to expand your annotations when necessary is a great bonus. the only thing i missed was the address book included with the other planners but i transferred mine from the 2006 one ",positive

" after several years of using and ultimately destroying a variety of cheap ~$50 leather executive chairs i got tired of it and decided to do some serious shopping. i went to office depot's web site and staring me right in the face on their main page was a sale ad for this chair. only $99 instead of the ususal $140 it said. $100 was about what i wanted to spend and being a large indivdual i thought it was serendipity. so i go to my local store the next day and they also have it marked for $99. i take a seat in their display model and instantly fall in love. it feels huge compared to my previous chair a model by the same manufacturer but cheaper and not as sturdy. i take the tag to the front to checkout and decided to read the store's sale ad while i wait for a stocker to get my chair down from the back with a fork lift. i look in the ad just to see if my new chair is in it but it's not. i was pleased to discover a note saying that i would recieve a $20 gift card with my $99 or up chair purcahse. excellent i though but it got even better when the checker simply deducted the $20 from the purcahse price instead of giving me a gift card. so in short i was able to score this completely excellent and most comfortable chair for only $80!!! it's incredible seriously. and the lumbar support is excellent. i can sit in this chair for hours at a time and my back doesn't hurt at all. i highly recommend this chair if you are a bit on the larger side like myself and find other desk chairs inadequate for your needs ",positive
" nice heavy duty office chair. i'm 260 pounds and this chair is real solid. has height and recline adjustments and nice leather. easy to put togehter ( about 15 minutes) if you are big or tall or just normal size and want a larger comfortable office chair.....this is it. ",positive
" the only drawback is the lack of height adjustment. otherwise it's comfortable with a tall back and large seat ",positive
" i went looking through amazon for a replacement chair for my computer desk. the old chair was refurbished by myself and purchased from a second-hand market. it's beautiful but after a couple years of wear and hours of sitting at the computer my neck was killing me! keep in mind that i have a relatively physical job lifting baggage 12 hours+ at the airport so my body is aching when i get home. i needed a comfortable chair with a high-back to rest my weary neck. i read some reviews of other chairs that say they were easy to assemble and in actuality were not. (keep with me i'm going to sum-up to a raving review!) i looked at a few chairs with massage features - vibrate & knead with embedded rolling balls. well i tried one of those chairs. the features are great but the chairs are ultimately uncomfortable. (here it comes i'm going to tie this all together.) not this chair! it is the most comfortable chair i have ever sat in! i wasn't sure what i was getting looking at a picture so i went to office max. all their chairs sucked! i went to office depot and fell in love! i can sleep in this chair! i can put my head back and play at the computer with a heating pad on my neck. it's roomy and oh sooooo comfortable! words cannot express how much i love this chair! when i took it out of the box i thought this is going to be so hard to put together and the air lift wont work; it probably wont feel the same way it did in the store. wrong! i put it together in probably 5 minutes. the clean-up was harder - picking-up the bags and throwing away the box. why? because i could not get out of my new chair. heck i may just throw away my bed and sleep right here...well if i could get up. as for the massaging. i just may get a massaging seat pad so i can put it in my car too. if you want the full effect get a cordless mouse and keyboard!! trust me you will not regret pampering yourself in cushy comfort! get this chair! ",positive
" great value sturdy hangers. low price didn't mean cheap it meant affordable. compares to others in the pricerange of $50.00 for the set. i would have paid less than $15.00 for one instead of three...i'm not compaining. this is one for the consumers!! thanks amazon!! ",positive
" the molesking plain reporter is an excellent notebook in many ways without doubt one of the best on the market. when you first open it and see the cover page with its space for a reward for its return you know that any moleskine notebook is a throwback to a more literate time when words and ideas were more important to the people who made them. holding one allows you to imagine great people doing great things and that owning one brings you closer to them--not just writers but musicians scientists and mathematicians or anyone else who needed to have an idea and hold on to it. in its design the moleskine reporter is a classic with convenience features that make it surprisingly modern. its built-in rubberized cloth band keeps it from falling open when dropped; it's back pocket allows you to keep miscellaneous papers and items like receipts stamps and photographs without making you resort to your wallet. its featureless blank pages allow you to establish your own formatting as you work (making it perfectly suitable for combinations of notes and sketches in landscape and portrait formats)--the perfect feature when your forms of creativity require notes and drawings for visualization. better still its semi-hard covers give you a writing surface anywhere you have an idea from your hand when standing on a streetcorner to your thigh during a train or plane-ride. the moleskine plain reporter is something special a throwback to a more literate age that is perfectly sized to fit in the back pocket of a pair of levis ",positive
" just a few months ago i hadn't ever heard of moleskine let alone know about the global fan culture that exists for these little notebooks. when i first saw them in a display in a business bookstore in london i was taken by their design and functionality as much as by the evocative marketing. now about nine weeks later i've bought my third moleskine this small squared reporter notebook. i know some people take their moleskines deep into the jungle on exotic global treks or journey with them to the very heights of imagination or contemplation. in that spirit i take this notebook to the harshest environment i regularly encounter: the gymnasium. my previous gym notepad eventually ended up looking pretty thrashed. i'm confident the moleskine will fare better both because it's smaller and because of the fairly sturdy cover. if i do have one complaint though it's about that cover. it doesn't flip fully over to the back the way the cover on a spiral-bound notebook can so when you're reading or writing in it the top sort of flops around. (maybe the top *does* flip over and i just haven't brought myself to brualize the notebook that much yet. but it's not obvious it's designed to do so.) still it's a solid attractive functional and easily portable notebook. and in a utilitarian environment like a gym that's a very good set of characteristics to have ",positive

" i was a little hesitant to purchase the chrisopher lowell bill organizer after reading some of the reviews. i decided to go out on a limb and purchase one. mine came perfect all the dividers no assembly required what so ever. i was worried that all the bills due the same day would not fit but they did. i do take the bills out of the envelope before puting in the slot and some slots have three to five bills in a single day. i love it and would not trade it for the world. if you never want another late bill buy one of these and use it. thanks da ",positive
" the quality is nicer than i expected. after shopping around for a bill organizer i settled on this one because of the price. other wood ones were much more costly so because of the low price i expected it to be a little on the junkie side. it's actually quite nice. it has 2 large draws that are lined with a velvety material and are great for storing check books stamps scissors and pens. the plastic dividers could stand to be a little nicer. mine are slightly bowed from being dislodged from their slots during shipping. i think they will straighten out over time now that they are in their proper slots. i'm happy with this product for the price i paid. ",positive
" i have seen products similar to this for substanially more money. when this one arrived it could easily rival one of the more expensive models. the plastic top detracts a bit from the overall look but serves its purpse well. the remainder is beautifully constructed. the drawers are lined in black fabric like a jewelry box. it looks like it cost much more than it did. i thought i would tuck this away in a corner of my office but it is so attractive i will probably have it front and center ",positive
" this product came in excellent condition. i think that the guy who got the bad one should have just returned it for another. everyone is entitled to one bad one of the bunch! the only assembly i had to do was to re-adjust the plastic dividers. i ordered it may 25th and received it may 26th. very fast shipping!! i'm very pleased ",positive
" i hate it for that other guy but the one i have came nearly fully assembled and in fine shape. i like the two drawers as i keep my checkbook & return address labels in one and my check writing pen and stamps in the other. i've have absolutely no problems with it. best place to keep it is somewhere it's always in view. worst part about it is getting into the habit of checking it every day.

" i was looking for a beginner microscope for my 7 year old. this was probably more than she needed for her age but with adult supervision it should last well into her later elementary years. the package came secure and on time. it was exactly what i expected. it is a solid product and i prefer the plug in option that this product offers versus other products that require batteries. the highest power (400x) is difficult view with some slides but i believe it has to do with practice. we have been successful viewing certain slides with the highest power setting with some patience. it is absolutely fascinating.

" this bookstand is what any student researcher or writer needs but didn't know that they needed. i had always had trouble with quoting analyzing and reading from my books and articles while trying to type up papers. a bookstand was suggested to me and lo! has it helped me greatly. now i can open a book or rest a journal article on it looking at it while i type. a nice bonus of this stand is that it is double sided. one side has grips that come up to hold open stiff books. the other side is more for laying something against it like a magazine. a helpful device that you often don't realize you need you will be grateful at how much assistance this little doohickey gives you ",positive
" this item was the best product that i ever bought! it really works. to blend 2 colors you have to put the tips of the marker into the chamber and twist the markers. you can also mix 3 colors or 4 too. it's worth the price. ",positive
" i was a bit thrown in the beginning because the item shown when purchasing is the original hp ink in the original packaging. this item does not come like that. it's separately boxed and from what it looks like it was a cartridge that was just refilled. honestly i don't really care. it's for my printer at home and it does just as good of a job as the original printer cartridge that i had for way less money. i will definately buy again. ",positive
" this is an inexpensive way to store lots of cd's including those for a computer. this box is heavy cardboard covered with waterproof vinyl that is folded when delivered and snapped together. you can't stand on one but these boxes are still quite rugged -- at least as strong as plastic. a single box will hold 30 cd's in full jewel cases 60 cd's in slim cases or 165 cd's in envelopes. that's a lot of cd's for not much money. i started with three boxes and am now buying them by the dozen. you'll find lots of uses for them.

" contrary to the previous reviewer i love tazo awake tea. i drink several cups each morning to help me awake. it is a dense rich tea unlike the grocery store varieties (lipton tetley et al)---try it and you will see the difference. also quite good iced i usually pour what is left in the teapot over ice to drink with my lunch. quite good. i wish it was more widely available but look for it it is worth it ",positive
" i bought this for my daughter. she says this kit has more tools than the kit she bought at college ... and it cost less. ",positive
" i ordered three penagain pens for gifts since i liked one i recently bought at postal annex. it seems the pen from amazon has a newer and better clip design and a better ink cartridge -- fixing the problems people have complained about in earlier posts of cap clip wearing out and poor ink flow. after years of keyboarding and some carpal tunnel issues this pen works superbly for me. love it! ",positive
" this is a very clever product. it's a totally new design for a pen. now it probably won't take over the world--the old design is pretty good too. i bought this because of it's uniqueness. i bought 2 and gave one to my 4th grade daughter and the other kids thought it was the coolest thing. i had hand surgery last year with very limited mobility and this would have been great for me then ",positive
" i bought this pen today at walgreen's out of interest. as a psychology student at clark university and a person who was given a diagnosis of mild dysgraphia i am always looking for ways to try to improve my writing without painstaking ot which is not quite worth it. it seems to me that this pen is in effect reteaching those of us how to write. when one tries to grip the pen hard it is very uncomfortable. therefore the pen conditions the user to use less pressure and write with a relaxed hand. with the muscles of the hand relaxed it is harder to exhaust muscles to produce clamps and aggravate the symptoms of carpal tunnel. note that no scientific proof of this hypothesis exists; it is just my observation. the design is good but the fit and finish could be better. i would like to see this pen made out of finer more durable materials such as aluminum and certainly with a better gel-type ink ",positive
" this cool looking pen is also stressless! use it often to avoid cramps or just to look progressive ",positive
" as someone with above average penmanship all my life i was dismayed as my fine motor control began to suffer some over the past few years. it didn't affect anything else but my ability to precisely control my penstrokes. i recently discovered the penagain original and immediately re-discovered my ability to write fluidly and precisely. then i found the ergo-sof version which is even better than the original in terms of comfort. the ergo-sof also has a better clip/cap release mechanism. i am absolutely delighted to have discovered this pen. ",positive
" my pensmenship is not so great due to long years of typing instead of writting. i pretty much was looking for a solutions and came accross this ergo pen when i received it i gave it a try and immediatly improved my writting had more control over the letters and lines were drawn better than before. i recommend this ben to whom ever is having trouble writting neatly. thanks guys! ar ",positive
" this pen needs gel ink to make it perfect. the regular ink is often difficult to get flowing. but it does the job. penagain products were the only ones that caused me no pain after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome and tennis elbow ",positive
" i bought this pen as a token christmas gift for my office peers. it's really hip looking and kind of sexy. they all love it! and each time i walk by their desks they are all using it!! i can't miss it because i got the bright blue color. why didn't i buy one for myself? ",positive
" ok so they don't teach penmanship anymore. kids are more likely to type before they write. but suppose you'd like your kids to at least have a knowledge of decent handwriting. it's good to practice loops and curves but calligraphy can be a fun hobby and a great way to get artistic. this set comes with nibs cartridges color inks and projects. sit down on a rainy day with the kids and make placecards for the birthday party for grandma and grandpa's anniversary or just copy out poetry. this is a great teaching tool and some kids find it a wonderful hobby. a fun thing to do: take two pencils and rubber-band them together. have your child pick out a favorite line of poetry. take the pencils on a piece of bristol board and draw curlicues and lines representing the poem and then fill in the lines with the poetry using the calligraphy pen. erase the pencil marks with a gum eraser. you have a very distinctive work of art ",positive
" just wanted to share with you that i was so happy with my christmas cards. they were delivered on time. they were beautiful and unique! ",positive
" my 6 year old received these for his birthday and loves them. my only complaint is that it didn't come with the belt as stated and my requests to the company to send one went unanswered ",positive
" we knew we could not just get one set. both kids have enjoyed using the pens. ",positive
" my 4-year old had to have blendy pens and i have to admit they are pretty neat. but a 4-year old has a hard time with the twist-and-wait concept...so his color doesn't come out quite like we see in the commercial. the pens make him happy and keep him entertained - and that's good enough for me. the paper that comes with the pens is the best part; i just wish they supplied more or had refill options. we've gone through the paper and the pens have lost their luster to him on their own. i'm buying another grande set it makes the most sense money-wise. worth the money if your children love drawing. ",positive
" this is the best ever!!!!!!!! it's so much fun to blend colors. if your planning to get a set get the el grande kit because it's pretty cheap and it's the only set with all 24 pens and all 12 fusion chambers. this is so much fun!!!!!!! ",positive

" if you enjoy a the old feel of a fountain pen without the hassle this is a great deal. i use it for some note taking and signatures. it is not really a fine point ",positive
" the seller was amazing. i ordered two and received them by the next day. the pen writes very smooth and flawlessly. would definitely recommend. i do wish this wrote a little thinner though ",positive
" i see that linda has already laid down the exact same review for all the colors and all the nibs of this pen so there's not much new i can tell you other than (1) to confirm what she wrote and (2) to add a few new details. this is an excellent introduction to fountain pens for those with hesitancy about buying one. i've collected a few vintage and new fountain pens over the years; some of them lay in a display box loved but unused. on contrast you will use this pen! it's incredibly cheap for the quality so you get a basically positive experience (smooth flowing liquid expression) without the price or the ultimate cost...losing the darn thing. at prices ranging from $40 to $400 and beyond (amazon.com sells a namiki fountain pen for well over $4000) the habitual loser of inanimate objects would be understandably reluctant to invest in a gold-nibbed laquered objet-d'art and would opt instead for this beautiful cheaply that even calls itself disposable! it's a personal preference but i'd opt for the fine nib over the medium if you're going to use this everyday--you'll write faster and use less ink. the medium is nice for big john hancock-ish signatures and weighty thoughts but you lose a little expression (those personal shadings and slight angles that even the untrained can't help but produce). the steel nib writes surprisingly smoothly and as mentioned above the ink doesn;t evaporate too quickly. you can't refill the pen (it's disposable just because of that) but you can buy several in different colors and nib sizes and get some idea of what kind of pen suits you. if and when you feel like you want to purchase a re-fillable fountain pen try for something under $50. levenger.com's excellent true writer and the retro brand pens sell for about this much. although those liquidy smooth gel pens have taken some over some of the non-ballpoint market the mechanically-minded will enjoy the physics of bottle-filling a pen; others will simpy dig the tradition of using a pen with a rich history. when it comes to fountain pens the p is for panache. ",positive
" i use fountain pens everyday so i know what i am talking about: this is a great fountain pen for everyday writing -- one that you will not care gets lost or damaged due to its very low price (unlike the average (non limited edition) fountain pens which can cost over $100 -- and sometimes much more). the pilot varsity pen lays down a great fine-to-medium line of ink and the nib (ie: the writing tip) does not dry out too fast when left uncapped -- and the pen seems to write forever with its large internal ink reservoir. fantastic buy; and with no muss-'n-fuss of having to refill the pen either! ",positive
" this is for those folks who love the feel of writing with a fountain pen yet don't want to invest megabucks in a pen that might get lost. the solution - this smooth writing fountain pen that is disposable and inexpensive. no fretting if you lose it ",positive
" i had the good fortune to tour the richeson easel factory. i was truly impressed! incredible craftsmanship attention to detail and as i came to find out service oriented. i would never buy a different brand after seeing what went into it. extra note: they use lyptus wood. as hard as oak but a renewable resource. when you buy one it tells you all about it. really fine easels ",positive
" it cuts like butter! this cutter is awesome. i am so glad that i bought it. i've tried several different cutters and this is the best. it cuts straight (use the holder to hold down the paper). i can trim off the tiniest bit of paper. i am so excited about this product! ",positive
" i love this little cutter! the base is only 6 wide so it's perfect for traveling. the orange part of the handle and the measuring arm both store under the unit. the key to using this cutter properly is to hold your paper securely with the orange paper guard which is attached to the top of the cutter. the only downside to the cutter is when you have to cut at a specific place or around a text box; it's difficult to see where you're cutting unless you have a light source under the cutting edge. otherwise i would suggest it to anyone ",positive
" while it looks a little odd this pen is really comfortable to hold and use. come to think of it it is good that it looks odd nobody accidently walks off with it. my wife really loves it since her hands cramp up with normal pens. by the way it will never roll off the table ",positive
" i got these as stocking stuffers for my two daughters who are students. it took a little bit to get aclaimated to it but it was definitely easier on the hand and wrist ",positive
" i have nerve damage in my primary hand and was unable to write with it at all until i got this pen. the positioning allows me to work around the damabe to my thumb. i never thought i would write with my primary hand again but i can with this pen ",positive
" i am a nurse in a very busy ed and have had multipul hand surgeries it is painful to say the least to write at times this pen has given me back the ease of writing all over again thank you so much. just one draw back do not i repeat do not let anyone play with the pen again the device breaks easily when put in the write mode it retracts very easily after it is broken ",positive
" when i first saw the pen again i thought to myself why would i switch from the stick pens & pencils i've used all my life? then i tried it and realized that it introduces a whole new approach to writing. i now use the penagain with my left hand as well -- whoever created this should invent a highlighter as well for college students who want to highlight with one hand and write with the other.

" i bought this for my niece for christmas and she ripped it open and began drawing immediately. it was perfect to get her started ",positive
" prismacolor pencils are well-known for their range in rich colors and vibrant laydown setting them apart from any other type of colored pencil. i've tried them myself and i agree. the lead is wonderfully soft and therefore makes blending colors and pushing them into one another an ease to do. the downside is that the lead is a little too soft and makes it harder to get the colors smooth (it's easier to do with crayola because crayola has harder lead). it can be done however and these are great pencils that especially go well with prismacolor markers. : ",positive
" i ordered this thinking it was the box of paper in the picture but its just one package of 500 sheets order 10 if you want the box shown above. this is paper there is no such thing as bad paper so go for it this is good paper ",positive
" this really keeps stuff together nicely. my daughter has a whiteboard for drawing. she was always leaving her markers out and could never find the cleaning solution. it is a nice set for the budding artist. perhaps it's overkill for generic office use. this kit keeps things together and away from the toddler! also the low odor markers do make a difference ",positive
" these are great magnets but they're almost too small. i can't pick them up with my fingers off the fridge door. you'll need at least two to keep a 5x7 photo on the fridge ",positive
" i was also surprised by how tiny these magnets really are!! the good news: they're super strong and so small that they're barely noticeable. it looks our postcards are just magically affixed to the fridge. they're elegant and clean. the bad news: they're pretty tough to pick up off the fridge if you don't have nails and even then it's easy to drop one. good luck finding them when you do! still an excellent product just as advertised. just be sure that you really consider how small an 1/8 of an inch really is before you buy! ",positive
" when they say tiny that isn't an understatement. you can hardly see these when they are holding items to the fridge. they do work well i used two however to hold a postcard (so that it wouldn't swing). they are stong but count on two per item to make sure that papers don't slip. overall great product but don't be suprized when you get them and say that's it? ",positive
" the most ironic part of purchasing this item for me was when unpacking the amazon.com box of this great product discovering that it is packed within the very thing it is meant to simplify. outside of the fustrating plastic packaging it works as advertised ",positive
" i love this thing. i open most of my kids toys with it plus anything else in a plastic package. it is so simple so fast and just a brilliant tool to use. forget using scissors or knives you can really get hurt. the pyranna is safe fast and easy. thanks for making a great product ",positive
" they had exactly the product type style and quality i had been seeking locally (with no result) at an excellent price. shipping was swift and product arrived in perfect condition. could not have been more pleased. purchased a vinyl case from same source for casual use. still excellent quality ",positive
" after paying shipping handling and taxes it was cheaper to buy these locally ",positive
" i have used this pen and the uni-ball signo 207 which seems to be it's competitor. this energel is consistently smoother than the 207 on different paper surfaces at work. the 207 seems to need a moment to get going writing for some reason. the energel is out of the gate at full flow! both have .7mm tips but this energel seems to flow a tiny bit larger line than the 207. their both gels i think but this energel flows more readily. this pentel energel will be my goto pen for now and the future ",positive
" i love this pen. not only is it a gel writer with a firm tip but for those who misplace caps or loose them it is perfect. for those who also like to stick pens in their pockets this will help with the ink stains as it retracts when it is put in the pocket. i do wish they came in green. barrel is thick enough and has a rubber grip at the bottom so those who has had carpul tunnel etc eill be able to grip the pen without pain. thanks pente ",positive
" i got some pens free with rebate from staples once. and i love them. i used to use uniballs but these last longer and write smoother. plus they're retractable - and not a bad value either ",positive
" this pen really is the best pen. ever. also i would strongly suggest the 0.7 version over the 0.5 - yes it dispenses a slightly thicker line but it seems to convey a stronger sense of power over that signature wherever you may be bestowing it. yes i think i have found a pen for life ",positive
" i love these pens. i don't really have much more to add than that. they write very smoothly uniformly dispensing ink without blotches or bleeding through to the other side of the page. they make writing a true pleasure. and they're cheap enough that if you lose one you won't go nuts...although sometimes i do because i just love them so much. get them at target they're 2 for $2.50 while most places sell them for twice that price ",positive
" i received the card organizer as a birthday gift and love it-it something i would never buy for myself-and you always need cards for all occasions! the cards are beautiful! this would be a great teacher gift! ",positive

" if you like sharpies as much as i do you also look for the best prices possible. this is a very good deal and the pens last forever assuming you don't eat (or loose) them. try this set. i am never without a set of spares ",positive
" long lasting * non-toxic * multi-colored * good value what's better than a pack of 4? a pack of 12!!!!!!!!! sanford(r) sharpie(r) permanent fine-point markers assorted colors pack of 12 is an excellent value as it does indeed write relatively indelibly on almost anything. after it dries for a minute it becomes smudge-proof and waterproof. the non-toxic ink is a pleasant feature especially around kids and the four colors come in handy. if the fine point isn't right for you sharpie makes lots of others varieties in many different colors. you can find these markers at virtually any retailer. 5***** durability .... 5***** value .... 5***** versatility ",positive
" sharpies are the bomb. they are great for writing on cds stereo equipment posters footballs plaster casts you name it. colorfast and waterproof there is almost no surface they won't write on other than water itself. now available in these awesome vibrant colors too ",positive

" just wanted resonably attractive storage. these do the trick. ordered six and none were defective ",positive
" good buy. heavy but had to add rubber/plastic feet on bottom to make stable keep the lamp from rocking and scratch desk top. good reach with 22 arm can adjust lamp up and down and move arm to sides but can't angle the light to side. all-in-all a good lamp for the price ",positive
" it's made in china so i can't be too critical. the head was a little loose and i couldn't fix it and the screws at the base come loose after a while which i could fix. but i've had this light for about three years and have yet to change the bulb. it has two settings for brightness which is really nice has a nice heavy base and the long slim look is really nice ",positive
" i ordered this cushion for my rather large desk chair at work- and it works great! the foam is very thick but conforms to the body to support it well. the cushion is tapered at the front to prevent pressure on the legs. i would highly recommend this to improve posture and support while working at a desk. i am buying a second one to keep at home so when i work at my kitchen table on my laptop i am at the proper height. i also am an adult with adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and find this cushion allows me to sit for longer periods of time without becoming restless. i also used to find myself sitting on my leg or heel but with the cushion i am better at keeping both feet on the ground while i am sitting at my desk or table. kensington makes great products- i also love the kensington laptop stand for my desk at school that i also ordered on amazon as well ",positive
" i bought this to clean my lcd monitor because fingerprints highly annoy me but i use it to clean and dust everything around because it does such a great job dry without cleaners or anything and so it takes just a few seconds. cleans lenses monitors surfaces etc. with no scratches. it really holds on to dust and dirt. wash it every once in a while especially if you clean up particularly abrasive dust for some reason. shaking it out outside works fairly well for regular dust too and lets you know how effective the thing is ",positive

" hp was the first paper i tried when i started making t-shirts. it cracked so i got commercial iron-on paper. that cracked too. my supplier told me the iron had to be hot enough and i had to press hard putting my weight behind it (that's alot of weight... haha). so i bought a new iron set it at the hottest setting and i pressed each part of the transfer for the same length of time and i pressed hard. but i started burning the transfers because the new iron was too hot. so i set it a hair under the highest cotton setting (instead of all the way up to linen) and it was just right. (for a whole sheet transfer i first iron around the transfer to set it down; then i press in increments of about three inches for five long seconds all the way across making about four or five rows of presses to get from the top to the bottom and then start all over again going up and down making four or five rows of presses to get from one side to the other. i press and lift rather than pushing. when i'm done pressing i move the iron in a kind of circular pattern all around the transfer again pressing firmly. then i lift up one edge and peel it back a ways to check the tranfser. if it looks good i warm it up again where i'm going to peel and then start peeling and let the iron follow me so the transfer doesn't cool down as i'm peeling so i don't get shiny edges. phew what a pain in the ***.) anyways just when i really got the hang of it my supplier let me down and i couldn't get my professional paper in time for the weekend. so i went back to the hp using the same technique. it burned the first time and so i set the iron about a half a number under what i had it set at before and didn't iron it quite as long. it looked really good but i wanted to see if the transfer was strong enough so instead of waiting i threw it right in the washer (inside out cold water no bleach; knits-delicates setting on the dryer). i was surprised how soft it was! i couldn't even tell it was a transfer and the color was good! so it wasn't the hp that was the problem initially it was me. if you're gonna use this stuff (or any iron-on transfer) the best thing i can tell you is to experiment on an old shirt. try the hottest setting first and turn it down if it burns. (you'll know you've burned when you see something like a tea stain on your shirt it feels a bit fuzzy and you'll see part of your graphic is left behind on the transfer paper when you peel it off - i think that's because instead of the ink going into the shirt it burns back into the paper.) be sure to count the seconds and make sure every inch of the transfer gets an even hard press. i found the cracking is mainly due to the iron not being hot enough and not pressing down hard enough. the polymers gotta be sqooshed into the fabric. also i iron onto a nice smooth piece of wood and i don't use a pillow case or anything between the shirt and the wood and i stretch the shirt very slightly and tuck it in so it doesn't move when i iron. then i let the shirt cool down slowly before i take it off the wood (thinking if it cools down too fast that might make it crack more). before i got the new iron i was ironing with a piece of sheet metal on top of the wood to conduct heat. that was better but the new iron getting the temperature right and ironing hard and evenly did the trick for me.

" it's a good looking card holder that matches my desk. for the price it's worth it ",positive
" i am particular about paper cutters/ trimmers. i have used many over the years. this is like the traditional guillotine cutter but with a laser light to guide you as to where you should be cutting the paper or photo. this gives a very clean cut. no burred edges no paper getting caught straight line exactly where you want it. i do not recommend the small personal paper cutters with fixed blades that push/pull. i also don't recommend rotary blade cutters. both of these type of cutters get blunt quickly and are quite frustrating. they are also difficult to line up exactly where you want to cut. they purport to cut through a few layers of paper but this is simply not the case. i find it difficult even using one page in these cutters. after not very much use - such as one or two batches of whole page photos they quickly give you burred edges and the blades need replacing often. they tell you the grips are large and easy to use which is definitely not the case. i find the grip of this particular trimmer to be much more comfortable and user-friendly. i also really love the laser guidance. i highly recommend this product to any person that uses it for home office or personal use. ",positive
" that laser is very useful. this model is the most expensive but is the best one. i kept going back and forth office maxto return other models of the same brand but this was it. i'm definitely not returning this thing. it's ergonomic; just pull down instead of pushing down. i get a straigter cut without the blade going out of wack like the other models of this brand. worth every penny if you ask me. especially if you make business cards.

" i am very happy with this chair. it was pretty easy to assemble and it is very comfortable and seems incredibly sturdy which is important for a big guy like me. the wheels are a little tough to roll on my somewhat deep office carpet so some people might want to consider adding some sort of plastic pad to place underneath. but this is a great product ",positive
" fundamentally the reason we use a pen is to write on paper right? and the component of the pen that affects how a ball point pen writes is the refill. so when i bought a waterman pen for the design i was happily surprised that the refill was great. the ink flows smoothly. it doesn't blob. it has a high capacity and is offered at a decent price. waterman is an old time pen maker and they have a great reputation. these refills complete the package ",positive
" this is my 3rd of this type of mop. i only replace them because eventually something rusts out so i recommend getting maybe one replacement mop head. what i like best is that it dries in minutes since it basically soaks all the water back up. i won't use any other kind after this and am reminded of how dismal other mops are when i visiting others. we have fake hardwood floors terrazzo and ceramic tile and it's great on all of them. the one improvement i would like to see is a wider mop head so i can cover more area faster. buy this mop! this seller order time to ship receipt was about 7 days to fl.

" this sharpener is the only one i will use for my colored pencils- and i've tried them all i think. it is the only one that will put a short point on them and i realize this review is similar to the one above. what i don't understand is how everyone else above seems to be getting such a long wear out of them because i go through one of these every 3 months or so just about the time the warranty wears out (how strange). if anyone has a better sharpener that puts the same short-angle point on these pencils but last longer than three months i would love to know about it especially since staples no longer carries it in my area.

" i've run my panasonic kp-4a sharpener for nearly a decade with nary a hitch. it chisels keen points quickly with a little accompanying noise that wouldn't be disturbing in most situations. in fact the pitch tells you when the sharpening is achieved. seems unbreakable to me as long as one does not force pencils downward--just hold them steady and in 5 seconds the job's done. its sleek compact cordless design works on any desktop ",positive
" i use this on high-quality colored art pencils. they are very soft and shatter on ordinary pencil sharpeners with blades. this sharpener uses gears instead of a blade and sharpens at the same angle as other sharpeners that use gears (those with blades sharpen at a different angle). this is a replacement for my first one which lasted ~10 years and saved me ~$100 worth of pencils (these pencils are about a dollar each). i will not use another style.

" i am a college mathematics student and thus i find myself writing a lot. i write notes in class recopy them write down proofs over and over as well as write out a lot of homework. being a student means that i'm also on a budget! thus having a nice inexpensive pen is key to my success. i love fountain pens over ball point pens because you don't have to press so hard to write. pressing hard for so long turns writing into a painful task. this particular pen is actually designed for comfort and i have no problem writing with it for hours on end. it has a slightly triangular grip which makes it easy to hold and it is also very light. the strong clip on its cap is such that the pen never rolls off any desk. the nibs or tips of these pens are very strong and can take a lot of abuse. they have the same fine craftmanship as the more expensive lamy pens but the body being made of a plastic makes these pens very affordable. i am no expert on plastics but the one this pen is made from is a very high quality and strong. i don't imagine the body of this pen would break even if you drove over it in a car. adding to the inexpensiveness of these pens is that with a converter cartridge they are also refillable. you have to buy this cartridge separately but it is only a few dollars and available wherever the pens are sold. with an extra fine nib one bottle of ink easily lasts me a year and i drain a normal pen in a day or two. the clear plastic converter cartridge is one which you twist in order to refill it. i like the cartridge much better than the more traditional squeeze and fill ink bladders which are messier and you can't see how much ink is actually in them. this pen in particular has an interesting look. it is see through which is fun to look at but also helpful because i can see how much ink i have left and know if i need to refill it before class. a decent single use pen can cost you 5 dollars easily. the initial price of this pen is more but it will last you forever as well as spoil you with a writing quality far above that of a decent 5 dollar single use pen. fountain pens in general have a timeless style and this one is especially good looking. it is designed for comfort and most of all its really cheap ",positive
" like everyone else i was looking for a way to destroy cd's/dvd's primarily those used as backups. now that it's possible to back-up almost an entire hard drive to a very few cd-sized media it's important to maintain possession and version control. the possession is obvious: i wouldn't toss out an intact hard drive for fear of identity theft etc. the same is true of your backup media. version control may be less obvious but by dating my latest backups and then shredding any older versions i only have the latest. there are good reasons to keep your older media - i'm just not going to debate them here. the point is that this is an excellent shredder. look closely at the illustration and you'll see what i mean desktop - it's really compact. and it does an excellent job. i've run all sorts of media through this bad-boy and there's nothing left but confetti. with shredded paper you could (if you had enough time a flat surface and unlimited patience) put the original document back together again. not so with this shredder. for paper i've got a royal 85x confetti cut paper shredder also purchased from amazon. it's great and the two of them take care of most of my shredding needs. my office is starting to look like oliver north's...

" i have a number of shredders and bought this one mainly for it's capacity to destroy cds and dvds. it does an excellent job of that. it literally destroys them and they're totally useless and forever lost. the same for credit cards and small amounts of paper --- although i wouldn't buy it for paper as there are other machines far superior for that. i did however have a disappointment with the unit. it simply balked at taking a diskette. it's advertised that it destroys these. and it does if you can get it through the throat. fortunately not many people use these anymore but i have some old ones i wanted to get rid of and was not happy with the results i got from this unit in my one attempt to get a floppy through. i plan to call tech support and see if i had misunderstood something or done something wrong. the floppy finally did get through but only after jamming and balking. once through it was destroyed totally. for cds and dvds i highly recommend this little unit. it's very powerful and royal has good and fast tech support. i own another of their small shredders and found that to be so. [... ",positive
" this is perfect for the desktop. it excels at destroying credit cards dvds cds and floppy disc. in an emergency you can use it to shred paper including staples. because dvds cds and floppy disc are dense they lay flat and take up very little room in the debris basket. since paper is light it will bunch up filling the debris basket fast. if you do a lot of paper you want to consider a paper shredder with a larger basket. because it is shredding polycarbonate and metal the feeder slot snuggly fits dvds cds and floppy discs. this reduces the chance of high energy debris. do not look into the slot while shredding. because of the snug slot feeding paper into the md100 is not quick. if you want to shred less than 8 pages but cannot leave your desk you can use the md100. if you want to shred more than 8 pages or can leave you desk it is better to use a paper shredder with a larger feed slot and a larger basket. this is also a personal shredder if you need to shred from more than two minutes at a time (approximately 24 dvds or cds or floppy discs) you should get a commercial grade machine ",positive
" literally destroys cds dvds and floppy disks. i was surprised when it chomped its way through the floppies metal and all and left nothing but little pieces. as far as paper is concerned i would use an other kind of shredder such as a confetti type as this one you have to fold the paper so it doesn't always shred in small enough pieces. if you have media to get rid of there is no better little shredder than this. i keep it next to my computer and it doesn't take up much room so it is very handy to use ",positive

" what it is: this charmin ultra bathroom tissue is very soft absorbent long lasting and a terrific value. the shortcomings of the scott's standard mainstay roughness are not a concern here. charmin ultra is nearly perfect in every way. the new gold standard for the bathroom arguably has become charmin ultra especially if your needs require a softer tissue than the scott's. scott's standard bathroom tissue is stronger than charmin ultra but charmin ultra's strength is ample for the intended use of the product. the 2-ply construction makes the 200 sheet rolls go much farther than one might expect and does add body and mass to the product. add to this the extra absorbency of charmin ultra over scott's and i would say that charmin ultra has a clear edge. the bottom line: basically these two products compare much like bounty versus viva paper towels. while both products score high marks in every area there are significant differences. bounty is stonger and viva is softer making both choices excellent but dependent on the needs of the individual consumer. results of our in-house trial between this charmin & scott extra soft: we compared charmin ultra to scott super-soft in what turned out to be a no-contest event. the charmin ultra is much softer than the scott extra-soft though the scott extra-soft is an improvement over their standard product but still quite rough.

" the lamy safari is an excellent pen: light sturdy attractive design that lets you monitor your level of ink. it's great if you like thick pens (i don't but people do) and i should have gotten the fine tip rather than medium because i can empty a cartridge in eight pages of free-flowing ink. on the other hand it's a great pen if you're stuck with a bunch of cartridges that come from your checkered past: the sales rep says it can only handle lamy-proprietary ink cartridges but that's nonsense. mine goes through parker and cross cartridges like nobody's business with nary a mishap ",positive
" the clay machine. i was (still am) a rank beginner in clay jewelry making. books and the web indicated that to work with polymer clay a clay machine is a virtual must. i had my clay and i had things i wanted to try with it. so as part of gathering every possible tool i might ever need i purchased a clay machine. it has become the tool i use the most. to condition clay i use the machine. to knead clay i use the machine. to flatten clay i use the machine. i can choose different thicknesses for my sheets from about 1/4 inch to unbelievably thin. the clay machine helps with blends and cranks sheets out so fast making canes is much faster than without it. i was able to make several really ugly ones right away--ha! (joke for all you old handers out there.) finally the clay machine needs little cleaning. just wipe it off with a clean cloth or run old clay through it. and there are experts on the web who will teach you to break it down scrub it up etc. if you are so inclined and just have to see how it works. i'd rather make beads...

" for kids who demand realism these colored pencils augmented by #b00006rvtb (multicultural set of eight colored pencils) are an adventure no matter what your age. even the littlest artists want to get things right - - though they often end up using some crazy chartreuse &/or purple to prove themselves in today's fantasy world. i can recommend three coloring books appropriate to use with this wonderful array of colors: ancient native american coloring book (# 0785820647); great african-americans coloring book (# 0486288781); great african-american athletes coloring book (# 048629319x). try any & all of these from dover publications. for the more sophisticated the skintones of apricot burnt sienna and mahogany are also available in binney & smith's sets of paints. to have them so widely available proves the point that being politically correct is an o.k. (even profitable) idea. it took years of agitating by kids to achieve this - - or was it the united methodist women who spearheaded that campaign? reviewer mchaiku applauds all who worked to give companies the wake-up call. and - - be sure to read reviews by smeequat ash for knowledgeable & helpful 'weighing' of artists' supplies.

" never assume colored pencils are for children. never assume that a cheap art item is a poor quality art item. crayola for me are best known as the most afforadable and widely ranged set of pencils on the market. they have hard lead that gives very smooth laydown. with these pencils it is always best to start out light and layer your colors until you get a sleek natural result. the problem with crayola is that the lead is too hard for blending i.e 'pushing' the colors into one another. if you are the type of artist who is into such things i suggest prismacolor pencils. but you can mix a little with a white crayola pencil so give it a try if you like. overall wonderful for hardcore traditional artists or beginning scribblers. it definately won't burn a hole in your pocket.

" i've used these pens for more than 5 years. the ink sumdges; that's true for any fountain pen. and the new design (pin stripes) is much less elegant than the old. otherwise these pens are a joy to write with; they create smooth flowing lines and move across the paper effortlessly. i hate to write with anything else ",positive
" i use fountain pens everyday so i know what i am talking about: this is a great fountain pen for everyday writing -- one that you will not care gets lost or damaged due to its very low price (unlike the average (non limited edition) fountain pens which can cost over $100 -- and sometimes much more). the pilot varsity pen lays down a great fine-to-medium line of ink and the nib (ie: the writing tip) does not dry out too fast when left uncapped -- and the pen seems to write forever with its large internal ink reservoir. fantastic buy; and with no muss-'n-fuss of having to refill the pen either!

" fiskars has a knack for not only sharpening their blades but for affixing both pieces of the scissors in a way that they don't wobble or cut poorly. whether you buy them new or use them for years these babies are right on the mark. they cut a crisp clean line through paper and can be used for fabric hair or just about anything else that needs cutting. if you cut hair and/or fabric however it's a good idea to have a different pair for each thing you're cutting. scissors dedicated to cutting fabric won't always do well on paper or hair and vice versa ",positive
" i've recently swapped from sitting at a desk (which i have done for nearly 20 years) to working at a stand-up desk. i found that standing on office carpets even while wearing comfortable shoes was tough - i would barely last 5 to 10 minutes. and the accumulative effects were enough that i doubted i would get acclimatized anytime soon. having tried this mat for a week now i found that i can stand on it for 20 minutes or more at a time straight away. and even at the end of the 20 minutes my feet don't feel bad - i am just sitting at that point because i am sick of standing not because i have to sit. rather than move the mat out of the way i am allowing my chair to roll over it. it is not conducive to rolling (being a high chair i don't have the leverage to move it much even on the normal carpet - on the mat i have no hope). when i move the chair away i can see definite indents in the mat where the wheels were however these spring back within 5 minutes or so. this has been an excellent purchase as far as i am concerned ",positive

" well it sounds funny but it sure is pretty. i wanted to make my own beads because some i purchased for making jewelry lost their outer coating and turned white! and these were glass beads.... i found sculpey and ordered the 10 pack to see how it would work. the colors are beautiful and the clay holds its shape mixes well for marbling and blends to form additional colors. to make your creations permanent just bake them in your oven at low temperatures. easy as this is sculpey's baking instructions (use glass 15 minutes per 1/4 inch etc.) are a little too specific for my taste. as a beginner i find it troublesome that some of the things i am baking may be thicker than others and therefore undercooked or the thinner ones may burn if i try to compensate so do i bake them separately?@!*&! or what? i notice old handers just seem to lower the temperature and cook everything 30 minutes. i'm not that brave yet. but so far nothing has burned and nothing has turned back to raw clay so i must be doing something right. or sculpey is more cooperative than its makers know.... i'm actually quite proud of some of my beads now and i've been at if for less than a month. sculpey can get you off to a good start too ",positive

" i've been using this model pen for over 15 years. i started using this pen when i was in the military where my job required me to transcribe live foreign language radio transmissions. my colleagues and i tried many different brands and models of pens and for me this pen offered the best performance. when speed is essential you learn to write small and the extra fine point is perfect. over the years i've noticed some problems with this pen but nothing bad enough to make me choose another pen. after beginning to use a new pen if you leave it tip up for a long time (several months) it stops working. also it is necessary to use a lighter touch with this pen. if you press too hard the tip will bend and if it bends too much the pen will be useless so using this pen in a rough environment i.e. trying to write while in a vehicle that is driving off-road is not recommended. i still keep my eye out and try new pens every so often but i keep coming back to the pilot precise v5 extra fine point ",positive

" i'm an artist and i use many kinds of inking pens to stylize my comic work. at a family member's house i found a few of these and decided to test them out. as my title said simply writing didn't do justice for this pen. the rolling ball guarantees no stickiness the ink being luciously gel-like and practically being one with the paper it is so smooth and slick. even better is that i have never had this kind of pen leak or run emphasizing what a high-quality tool it is. and a personal thing i find attractive is that the ink is pitch black no faint hues whatsoever. that's just me of course. for artists out there this is a good idea for drawing (reasons above and) because it has a wonderfully rounded tip so you never need to worry about the point bending or breaking. and you still get a fine line! whether you are a writer artist or both this is the pen i would suggest for anyone. it's a dream in a writing utensil simply put ",positive
" the next time you find yourself in a classroom check out the teacher's pen. whether used to grade kindergarten handwriting or comment on english 101 compositions the pilot precise v5 (especially in the color blue) seems to be the first choice of teachers everywhere. rollerball pens are clearly more expensive than the commonplace ballpoint models but justify their cost. despite their similar name ballpoints lack the fluid line precise control and quality ink found in rollerballs. i make do with cheap ballpoints to take notes for medical school and on patient records in the hospital (my handwriting deserves no better) but my wife the english major (actually linguist) will accept no substitutes. joyanna loves the bright classy blue of these pens and the way she can control the thickness of the line with the lightest touch. pilot apparently makes use of a proprietary ink control system; it makes up that funny stack of baffles in the first part of the shaft behind the tip. with the fine pointed tip it makes for lines of even thickness and color with only a light touch (it can be hard to get used to for pen-mashers like me). the clear plastic ink-gage on the side is useful. joyanna has tried slightly cheaper pens but a 12-pack like this seems the only option that is truly satisfactory. pilot's v7 is similar but makes a thick 0.5 mm line instead of the thin 0.3 mm line produced by this model. the cap on the precise v5 seals tightly and has a strong metal clip. as with all standard rollerball pens changes in pressure on airplanes can be dangerous. pilot tells you to hold the pen upright when removing the cap in a low-pressure plane cabin but joyanna still keeps her pens in a plastic bag when flying. i have seen other pens made by pilot and other manufacturers that claim to be safe on planes but you might as well get a cheap ballpoint to put in you carry-on. the pilot precise v5 - the official pen of the national association of english majors - naem lake woebegone m ",positive
" let me tell you how wonderful these pens are: whenever i'm writing with another pen i find myself longing for the pilot v5. after writing with these for 7 years there's just nothing else that compares. for me the pilot is the most conducive pen in getting the thoughts in my head onto paper. it's smooth and fluid writes with the epitome of ease and precision and has a nice minimalist look. i'v graduated to buying these in boxes rather than just single pens because i hate being without them and having to use &quot;other&quot; pens. once you try the v5 you'll know what i mean ",positive
" i've been using these pens exclusively for the past 12 years ever since i noticed that my 10th grade teacher used them to correct my english papers. i have found no pens that even come close to the pilot precise v5. they write in the perfect thickness they never smear and the ink flows so smoothly through the rolling ball that there's never clumping. i'm noted for my nice handwriting and i swear that most of this neatness comes from this pen ",positive

(think mid 60's jaguar e-type versus 2005 honda civic. which is more fun to drive? which would you drive to the grocery store? get my point?) bottom line: it is a $25 pen that you'll use more than your $100+ antique pens.

" the joy is an elegant addition to lamy's well-designed line of affordable functional fountain pens. i'm a big fan of lamy's safari for everyday writing and have been using one for years (see separate review). the joy is the longer pointy-ended calligraphic cousin of the safari which is also a plastic fountain pen with windows on the side. in fact the caps are interchangeable and the threading joining the front and back halves of the pen is the same so i normally write with a joy nib section screwed into a safari back end since i don't like the joy's long end section for everyday writing and carrying in my bag or pocket. aesthetically speaking i like the long tapered design of the end which reminds me of the dip pens i used to use for art and calligraphy. while this design is fine for a pen that lives on a desk it's a little too long for carrying around the campus or office. that being said i consider this a matter of taste than a problem with the design. like the safari the pen nib is durable and writes pretty smoothly and consistently...easily the best of the various pens i've tried in this lowest price range. it's a light pen with a relatively narrow molded grip section so stay away if you would rather write with a hefty chunky pen. the 1.1 mm straight chisel nib is perfect for me. i'm a lefty so most oblique nibs won't work. the chisel nib is just wide enough to give my otherwise ordinary handwriting a pleasant calligraphic and more substantial quality. (with the right inkn and paper combination you get beautiful variation in tone and darkness in your strokes as the ink dries.) however it's not so wide that i can't write with it every day unless i need to write really small. i write letters take notes on standard lined paper address envelopes fill out forms sign checks etc. with this pen without worry. as an everyday user of fountain pens i can say i really enjoy writing with this pen and the safari both. however i only dabble in calligraphy and cannot speak for this pen's appropriateness for someone who does that sort of work more seriously. i expect this would be a good starter pen however for a beginning calligrapher...possibly one of the wider nib versions if they don't expect to use it for everyday writing or fine (as in small) calligraphy work. p.s. if you like a more serious industrial look lamy makes a version of this pen in black plastic and aluminum ",positive

" i have a lamy safari and a lamy joy (both in the colored plastic versions---not clear or aluminum). i got this converter so i could eliminate the waste of disposable plastic cartridges and use the bottled ink of my choice in my pens. this converter has good capacity (refill frequency varies of course with ink nib paper and writing habits) and a long knob with two flats that's easy to twist for refilling. the body is clear and makes it easy to see how much ink is left through the windows in the pen body of the safari and joy. with practice i can now fill the converter with one hand holding the converter body between my pinky and ring fingers and twist the plunger knob with my thumb and pointer finger. this leaves my other hand free to tip the ink bottle if necessary. i've been using one of these converters for years and they seem to last fine. it's a simple device but i can think of worse designs. if you don't have the same pens as i do see the lamy site to see if the z24 works with your lamy ",positive

" as a former kgb agent formerly stationed in former czechoslovakia i can't tell you how useful the moleskine city notebook: prague would have been to me back when i was a junior agent just beginning my career at the former prague bureau. i remember one time i was supposed to tail a dissident on his way to meet his cia contact. i followed the guy over the charles bridge towards old town but then lost him in a crowd near the town square. i went back to the bureau shame-faced but my understanding superior told me to write up a detailed report about what i saw and where. as i sat down to write that report i realized that without an accurate map or detailed notes i could not reconstruct what i had witnessed so i made something up. i ended up making up many of my reports mostly due to my poor organizational skills. if i had had my maps and notes in one compact and convenient notebook i might have saved myself a lot of trouble. my understanding superior became much less understanding when he found out that i was writing fiction and soon i found myself in noril'sk siberia north of the arctic circle where i have seen people's eyeballs freeze in their heads. after the soviet union collapsed i packed my things and left the kgb but the idea of revisiting prague has never left my thoughts. this time however i plan to have my moleskine city notebook: prague with me and you can be sure whatever notes i write will have nothing to do with dissidents or defectors and everything to do with the best restaurants oldest architecture and warmest hotels that prague has to offer ",positive
" the cost of this unit is about what i have lying around in coins in the house. so for the price of one batch of my coins i have a convenient way to organize them and take them to the bank; our bank doesn't count coins anymore and i don't like spending 8% for the coin counting machine in the grocery store ",positive
" in a nutshell: standard size - well-made - easy to use - comes in good box these envelopes are a little bit pricey but they do accomplish what one needs a #10 security envelope to do; 1]- they are made of relatively heavy paper and reinforced where something like a check might be within the envelope. 2]- they self-seal which for me is a very big deal as i usually either get them too wet or i cut myself if i have to seal them myself. 3]- they come in a nice box which i usually give to one of my kids when its empty. it keeps them thinking about re-cycling. 4]- i can pick them up at office depot and avoid shipping this item. bottom line: a real no-brainer -- just can't go wrong here! an excellent product that it is very easy to take for granted ",positive
" my daughter is 7 years old and can do this by herself with no problems. it came with three framed art works. she crunched them and then hung them up in her room. very cute! fun bright colors and very easy to use. one of the things i liked best about this craft is that it wasn't messy! that's a huge plus for me as a parent ",positive
