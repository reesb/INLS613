" i guess i must have had the same mindset as adam in the previous review. i too set up the main unit and the remote side by side to see if the readings from both units would agree along with another very accurate digital thermometer. after six hours the temperature readings from all of the units were within one degree but the humidity readings from the remote unit were lower by 4 to 8 percent as compared the humidity reading from the main unit... which is 3 to 7 percent too much imo since they were side by side. what good is having a relative humidity function if you cannot trust the readings? i will return the unit. also on my unit the front wood bezel apparently had a small defect and it was repaired (from the factory) with a wood filler type material... but the defect was still obvious ",negative

" i can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. i was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. we used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). sanitation exclusion and very careful application of pesticides is what you need. rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). again count on sanitation exclusion and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap rather than in a wall somewhere) ",negative

" aside from the nifty weather prediction this clock is completely impractical. the projection numbers are about 1/2 inch tall with minimal clarity. the clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible. i am surprise this is sold on amazon. thank goodness for amazon's customer friendly returning policy. i think amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good.

" the good news is that it mostly works--although the weather forecast is as advertised only about 75% accurate. unfortunately it has some annoying flaws. 1) although it will provide either 12 or 24 hr format and either celsius or fahrenheit temps you can't actually select the temperature display--once you select 24-hr time format you get celsius temps whether you want them or not. if you want deg f you must select 12-hr time. 2) if you run the clock off batteries you have to press a button to get any projection. unfortunately the button you press is the snooze button which activates both the projection and the backlight; the button to control brightness of projection does not work in battery mode; activating both lights simulaneously is both redundant and wasteful as it runs down the batteries more rapidly than necessary. 3) worst of all the device emits a very annoying very audible high-pitched whining sound any time any button is pressed (including the snooze) and anytime you need to set or reset anything. 4) manual confusing; information on website did not tell me anything i needed to know. emailed support--no acknowledgement & although i eventually got a response it wasn't remotely helpful and i had already given up on them and returned the device ",negative

" my smoker arrived dented and chipped which i wasn't happy about but i could live with -- i don't expect a relatively inexpensive outdoor oven to maintain its new look after some wear and tear anyways. however the rails along the sides that hold the shelves are not welded together well. in fact two rails arrived completely broken off (opposite sides and at different levels) and a third was tenuously held in place by a single weld. i thought that the broken-off rails were parts to be used in the oven's assembly; otherwise i would not have unboxed the smoker and put it together. i would have returned it. because i had assembled the unit before realizing that it was broken i thought that replacing the broken parts would be easier than disassembling the unit re-crating and returning it. i called the distributor three weeks ago to order replacement parts that have not yet arrived. i've already waited longer than the distributor indicated i would have to before receiving the parts. if alternative gas-fueled smokers didn't cost a multiple of what this costs i'd be really angry. hands down this is the most unsatisfactory purchase i've made from amazon. in spite of the impairment of not having a fully functioning smoker i have seasoned it and used it once. the chicken i made was promising. (my hope that my experience with this smoker will improve lets me award a rating of 2 stars based on this one use.) if i ever get the parts i need i think the smoker will be adequate for initial experimentation with this kind of cooking. if i like the results i'll replace this smoker with a better one ",negative

" i live in a apt in nyc so roaches are very common problem. after a long battle i finally got rid of the roaches in my place but i cannot escape the bugs visiting from other apartments. i thought this device could help with that problem. also i don't like to use the spray too often or have all the baits gels and other poisons around so i decided to try these things. unfortunately they don't work. the first week i bought them i saw a big roach crawl under the door and walk directly under the repeller straight to the dining room. the ultrasonic frequency did nothing to it. instead of this repeller i use limonel (orange peel oil) is a safe alternative to use when children are present and it does repell and kill the bugs. so how to get rid of roaches? seal every crack nook and cranny with expansive foam wood sealer etc. mine came in through the bathroom and kitchen vents so i put mosquito screens to block their way in also i sealed the gaps between the wall and the electrical outlets in the apt with silicone and i bought a plastic stripe that closes the gap between the door and the floor. also my husband sprays once every 4 months with repellent. good luck ",negative

" yes the pot held the oil and turkey and the fire lit under the pot. it didn't fall down under it's own weight and fried my turkey. that said here are some problems. i had to make 3 trips to the hardware store so if you purchase this item and read this first you should knock that down to one trip. but you will make the trip none-the-less. first off the three scews that hold the legs on are listed at 2 but are more like 1 1/4 and thus had to be replaced ( or you won't get the nut on the screw ). second and this is crucial the main bolt that goes through the burner assembly burner holding bar and heat shield is made of made in china crap metal. it will already be installed and is sticking out of the burner assembly. in the instructions you have to remove it's nut and washers. but when reapplying the nut and washers through the bar and heat shield it will strip unless you get lucky and tighten it just right the first time. this bolt needs to be made of good steel... and it's not! if it's tight just let it be because you will strip it if you mess with it. it is impossible to find if you need to replace it because both hardware stores i went to didn't have it and didn't know where else to find it. it is a 6mm 2 3/4 bolt. my solution to fix the stripped bolt was to add 3 washers before screwing on the nut and thus catching on some fresh unstripped thread. luckily there was enough bolt showing. had that not worked this thing would have been junk just 1 day before thanksgiving and i'd have been rushing off to buy a differant one. just look over your parts before assembling this thing and make sure those bolts are as long as they're supposed to be and if not make that one trip to the store for bolts and washers too. i guess whatever model/brand you get will be made in china too (isn't everthing?) so i don't want to recommend another besides i've only owned this one. make sure you follow all precautions about using this thing to the letter. i would also add that even a little wind will slow down or stop your cooking time as the burner blasts out the gas so fast (which is normal for that hot a flame needed) that the fire is only on the tips of the gas so find a relatively wind free place errect/effect/find a windblocker/lean-to but definately outside and away from structures or anything that can fall and knock over your pot. gobble gobble! by the way the turkey was soooo good that everyone raved about it and wanted to take (did take) it all home. look around for tips on preparing injecting and rubbing the bird. i kept the temp at 350 (initially at 375 but after you slowly... slowly dip in the bird the temp will go down) and then maintain 350 from there out. get a bird at 15lbs or under (or the pot will fill too high) and cook for 3 1/2 min. per pound. look for more tips online. that bird was tastey ",negative

" i am extreamly disappointed with this product. the icons do not give an indication of the type of weather you can expect. instead they provide an indication if the weather is getting worse or better. the fluff on the out side of the box states: forecast icon based on changing barometric pressure. the way i read that is the icons will provide a forecast but they do not. i do not understand why you would have a rain icon a cloudy icon a partly cloudy icon and a sunny icon if they are not a forecast. i was so surprised at reading this in the manual i called la crosses tech support. tech support confirmed what i read was accurate. as stated in on of the other reviews the station is difficult to read when it is stand mounted. you will have to bendover or be in a seated position in order to see things clearly. adjusting the contrast does not help. wall mounting might be a better option. the buttons as stated in another review feel mushy when pushed. the outdoor sensor is not compleatly weather proof so you will need to mount it where it will not get wet from rain or snow. a potentially great product that is poorly executed.

" the clock was off by -4 hours even after so called rebooting. i called tech support and they requested me to send the clock back to them at my cost so that they can pop the hands off and advance it four hours. they should have replaced it for free but they did not. i just think this clock is just a big hoax ",negative

" i have owned the wmr-968 for several years now and have spent more on 'replacement' parts than if i had bought an entire new unit. primarily the solar transmitter on the rain gauge continually fails to bring the charge up to enough power for the transmitter to transmit back to the base. i have replaced this transmitter unit three times (twice with the 'new' style). living in the phoenix area we don't run into too many cloudy or rainy days but as soon as it doesn't get sunlight for any length of time the display reads all dashes (not receiving a signal). so when it rains here i usually don't get a reading of how much because this thing stops working. the anemometer is mounted on the same pole just above the rain gauge with the both of the solar transmitters also mounted on the same pole. the anemometer works consistently and fine. both os and the local distributor say the distance is too far the unit must have gone bad and needs replacement etc.etc. replacing the solar unit didn't help and the distance can't be too far for one unit and not the other. no one can help with this issue. so my suggestion would be to spend the extra bucks and get something more reliable.

" one star is the lowest rating i can give this system and it's frankly not worth even that. problems start with the design. you have to take out eight tiny little screws to insert the backup batteries or plug in a sensor cable into the nifty looking solar powered sender unit which has to be placed somewhere in full sunlight for it to function at all. once you've mounted the unit on your roof you have to remove those pesky little screws on the roof in the freezing wind usually several times a winter. or wait for spring and nice weather when you don't need to know if you can expect black ice on your early morning drive to work. sometimes resetting the base station works (which you have to place inconveniently so that the unit has direct line of sight communication. usually not. os sales has it advertised at 300 feet but actually something less than forty if your batteries are more than a day old (see battery change procedure above). by the way there is a backup nicad battery in the unit supposedly kept charged by the impressive solar power collector. this will fail because it rapidly loses capacity due to a poor discharge recharge cycle. if any of these three fail the unit won't function. strangely enough my rain gauge (i live in the desert) has continued to function for over a year with little attention. however the temp/humidity sensor which i would like to refer to most often is what fails every night. i'd like to replace the nicad battery but can't find one anywhere. ahem. customer service and the lack of it. i don't know how many emails i've sent. or calls i've placed. or time i've spent listening to the backside of the oregon scientific hold button. their website only lists complete systems in the replacement parts category. while assumptions can be dangerous my only option seems to be to scrap $300 worth of two-year old hardware and buy more and more and more. this was a well-intended gift. i'm trying to make it work. but it doesn't usually when i need it most.

" i bought the wmr968 2/10/2005 and as of today2/14/2007 only the indoor baro-therm-hygro still works. the anemometer was replaced under warrenty 11/2005. this service took 2 months to complete with oregon sci. the anemometer then quit 12/2006 and oregon sci. said tough luck it's out of warranty. the thermo-hygro quit 2/2007 and once again tough luck. my thoughts on the unit besides it not functioning after 2 years: cheap and cheaper. the manual is nearly worthless. the anemometer is accurate to about 60 kts. then gets wildly optimistic. the temp.humidity baro seem accurate. the rain gauge is kinda funky the way it reports because of a delay built in and the resolution but it is useable. all of the failures i have had i think are related to water intrusion into the sending units. everone has had green corrosion on the pc boards when taken down from the rooftop. the sealing of the units is very poor and the use of phone cords is very cheap. i just got off the phone again with oregon sci. and juan from customer service told me we can't help you. if you want a weather station that is made cheaply has no customer support and will last less then 2 years buy a wmr968. i guess for the price compared to professional weather stations this thing will attarct a lot of people but buyer beware ",negative

" sorry to say it as i've liked oregon scientific products in the past but this is a junker. two chief problems. first is that it doesn't know how to switch over to daylight savings time correctly. i understand that the switch-over dates were changed this year but this is the more recent model clock and the older rm826a has no trouble this year. i got up an hour late on that first daylight savings time sunday in march. sadly even if you manually set the rm323a to the correct time it will reset overnight to the wrong time. the only way to fix this (per oregon scientific's web site) is to turn off the radio connection to the atomic clock thereby defeating the reason for owning this clock in the first place. (in fairness o-s says that it will work fine after april 1 but what about future years when the dates change around? my guess is same problem.) the second problem is that it's very difficult to use including such basic stuff as setting an alarm. granted oregon scientific clocks don't have a lot of buttons so it has to be a little complicated to handle all of the functions. but this particular clock has both a single alarm and a weekly alarm that goes off every day at the same time and selecting which one setting the alarm time and even just turning on and off the alarm is anything but obvious. i suppose the world time capability could be useful for some folks but i find this clock worse in every respect than the rm826a which is no longer manufactured. i'm going to toss this one in the trash and find a couple of rm826a's before they're no longer available. oregon scientific has no more in stock as of a couple of days ago ",negative

" for the price i paid i expected much more accuracy. the data it downloads from its external monitor to the pc is terrible. even though the unit is synchronized with the atomic clock it still seems to get the dates wrong on the data it stores in its database. it also has a problem with the accumulated rainfall. the amount of rainfall according to the database is much higher that what the display shows for the accumulated amount. the hourly and 24 hour period also tend to behave eratically. you might see an inch of rain in the last hour but when you come back later the last 24 hours shows only .2 inches of rain. strange. how can you have more rain in the last hour than in the last 24? seems backwards. on the good side the unit is easy to set up and connects to your pc with existing ports and a cable that is provided. on the bad side besides being inaccurate the analysis software is primitive and difficult to work with. you are better off downloading a text file and doing analysis in excel. this unit also gives eratic readings with the temperature swinging up and down up to six degrees within a twenty minute window. i wanted my son to see how the temps over a 24 hour period form a bell shaped curve. so much for that. this is probably ok for a first time weather station for my 8 year old but i would not recommend it for any one else since this unit is not cheap. one other thing it only takes a reading every 1-3 minutes so wind speed readings are hit and miss. you could be getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens to read. i am dissapointed and annoyed that i spent the money and it is not at least semi-accurate. i will tell you that i have it set up wireless. if you use the enclosed hard wire connection option then you will get more frequent readings and maybe even better accuracy. good luck and do your homework first.

" just to make sure people don't make the same mistake i did be aware that this is not compatible with the weber q 200 silver portable propane gas grill. amazon.com lists this rotisserie as an accessory for the weber q 200 so it is amazon that deserves a low rating so i have just given this the current average of 4 stars ",positive
" weber products are well made and the 9891 gas barbecue rotisserie is no exception. the 'basket' style is a nice design. ",positive

" i bought this clock last week. amazon was prompt in shipping it on time. on having received it i place the aa battery in the clock selected the time zone place it on the wall after some time the clock second hand and hour hand started moving fast. it is actually searching for the signal. if it gets it immediately the time will be set accurately in 5 minutes. if not every hour the clock searches for the accurate time relayed from the colorado server. the clock finds the time signal within the next 4-5 hours. the chances of the clock finding the signal is high over night when there is less distortion. once ir receives the accurate time it will never fall behind. a very good time piece ",positive
" no longer is my wall clock wrong because of power shortages or because i failed to set it or reset it correctly ",positive
" we got the clock read the instructions installed a battery and hung it on an east / west wall. after the sun went down the clock was able to receive the station and set itself to the correct time. it has worked flawlessly for the last two months since we got it. it's nice to have the correct time all the time and the kids don't worry about getting out on time to catch the bus because the clock is off ",positive
" i had to return my 1st order due to mould on the wood (around the joins) and inside the glass front. my replacement has a little mould inside the glass front but i decided i could live with it.. i blame amazon's storage for this rather than the manufacturing of it by lacrosse. the glass front is spherical so tends to get weird light reflections so watch for this when you are hanging it. note that when the battery is low the second hand will move in 2 second jumps to let you know that the battery is low - this is a feature not a problem which i like. other than that it works great! (i live close to boulder and nist where the radio signal comes from so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks). ",positive
" the short of it is that this clock performs its job quite admirably. you insert a single aa battery and then press on one of four buttons on the back to tell it whether you are eastern time central time mountain time or pacific time. wait a bit - mine received a signal about 3 minutes later some people have to wait overnight. it receives radio signals from colorado and it will readjust itself nightly to keep near perfect time. it will also factor in daylight savings time. these it does well - and so it gets 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to do. however if you live in the east coast you must recognize that you are farther away from the radio source. this clock may not be able to set itself unless for example placed near a window. this is not a fault of the clock but rather a limitation of the radio waves. otherwise the clock seems well made the wood looks real and the numbers are easy to read from a distance ",positive
" one thing which mystifies me is how few people have embraced the latest in modern clock technology: radio controlled clocks which keep exact time by automatically synchronizing themselves with signals broadcast from the incredibly accurate u.s. atomic clock in boulder colorado. such clocks are not only always accurate to a fraction of a second they also automatically set themselves to and from daylight savings and standard time as appropriate. furthermore such clocks are typically quite reasonable in price. yet while most americans have for example the latest in modern cordless phones and cell phones relatively few have the accuracy and convenience of radio controlled clocks. this model is just one of many styles sold by amazon and other vendors. try one and i think you'll be glad you did. my wife and i have several of these clocks throughout our house and take accurate time for granted no what time system is in effect ",positive

" the umbrella i ordered is fine just what i had hoped it would be. however i subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. as a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. i have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store. any suggestions ",positive
" these are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed. i like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella -- very low tech and smart. my one issue with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for -- they are totally stationary and don't have a tilting feature. that might be standard i just don't know but i would have wanted that flexibility. oh and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible. and they're simple to put together and take apart. great price and they block the sun and look terrific ",positive
" bought this umbrella last week (9/23/05) from amazon. was initially hesitant about purchasing it due to other reviews describing the issue with the pole being in two pieces which when connected were never straight. all i want to add here is that i did not experience this problem. the screw mechanism which joins the poles seems sturdy and the pole appears perfectly straight. i wonder if other people had bought umbrellas from a bad batch or that the manufacturer redesigned the connection mechanism? (the most recent reviews do not mention this problem) re. overall quality i can't speak for how the pole or the umbrella itself will wear over time but at least initially it looks to be of good quality and sturdy construction. one thing to note is that despite the product description and picture making it look like the pole is made of wood it appears to be actually made of some sort of metal which is wood coloured (it still looks like wood though and would not look out of place with wooden patio furniture). to be honest i actually prefer this since i would imagine it won't discolour as easily as natural wood and should be longer lasting. in summary am very pleased with my purchase - i would happily recommend it to others looking for a good quality umbrella at a very reasonable price ",positive

" i have owned only 2 grills in my lifetime. both were little cheap and unsuited to my novice grilling status. when i committed to buy a real barbeque grill i read scores of reviews and descriptions to find the right one. after reading amazon's customer reviews of the performer (the 827020 22.5 inch performer charcoal grill with propane gas ingnition purchased in summer of 2003) i was so impressed i bought it. what a grill! i don't know how weber does it (convection perhaps?)--even my overdone meats come out moist and flavorful. veggies come out great--i grilled zucchini squash last summer and yumm! this grill gives me the best of both worlds: gas and charcoal. the gas feature allows me to light up quickly rain or shine. the small propane tank is not the primary energy source so seldom needs refilling. charcoal gives foods real barbeque flavor and my gardens love weber's convenient one step ash disposal system. i cannot praise this grill enough. i only wish the newer version inspired more positive reviews and hope friends i recommended the performer to can still find this model ",positive
" ok i'm not a freak but i love to grill and i own at least 5 weber grills. this one is hands down the best. i've been using mine since 1993 and it is the one to own. buy this model today as they have redesigned it without the stainless work area. it's perfect for cooking smoking grilling etc. every thanksgiving i cook the turkey on the grill and it's a hit every time. also leaves the oven free for other stuff. this is a mouth watering juicy turkey...every time. burgers come out great. chicken. bbq. i've done it all on this grill and it's great. buy the cover and take care of this...it will be your favorite piece of cookware that you ever purchased. thanks weber...it is the best ",positive
" this is the most awesome wonderful fantastic grill there is out there. everyone knows charcol can't be beat for flavor but it's a bummer to get started. weber has outdone themselves by inventing this amazing grill. it is super easy to start the coals easy to keep clean and looking fabulous easy to empty the ashes and easy move around the deck (out of our frequent seattle rain). and of course the food we grill comes out delectable. i am grilling a whole chicken tonight using the indirect method. a snap with this grill! it is well worth the price. we love it!!

" i got this grill last year as a father's day gift. i'd never smoked any meat in my life but have been a grill-man for a looong time. this smoker makes it easy. i've done ribs brisquet pork steaks chicken. all turned out great that brisquet especially! make sure you cure the inside of the grill before cooking anything in it. there are instructions in the box. also if your model doesn't come with the built-in thermometer make sure you order one from the char-broil website. using a standard oven thermometer wastes time and precious heat ",positive
" if you're looking to get your first smoker look no further. since it's a horizontal-style smoker it can also double as a bbq pit/charcoal grill. plenty of room very versatile. treat it well and it will give you a decade of use. the reason i can't give it 5 stars is because of the thickness of the metal. if it were a little thicker there would be much more heat retention. you can buy smokers with 1/4+ thickness but expect to pay at least $600. this is easily the best smoker in its price range. make sure you season the inside of the smoker similar to how you would season a cast iron pan. as with any smoker before use paint the interior of the smoker with shortening or vegetable oil then start up the smoker and let it smoke for a couple or few hours. also you should almost always keep the chimney vent all the way open. use the intake vent on the firebox for temperature control.

" just got this in the mail for my char-broil grill so at this point i cant speak for how it hold up over time. nonetheless this appears to be an exceptionally sturdy and well-made product. nice thick and heavy with two layers - a canvas like exterior and a black lining. for the price i cant imagine there is a better grill cover on the market. the one caveat i would offer is one many reviewers have noted the color is not as pictured. the amazon photo shows an almost teal green with a white middle section. the photos on the product box call the color 'mountain green' and show a forest green type color with a cream colored middle. mine however is a dark olive color one that could as easily be called brown ad green and the middle section is a cool cement-y grey not a warm white at all. it looks nice and is a great cover at a great price. but if youre ordering this to match your patio furniture (i certainly wasn't!) then this is something to be aware of. the only other warning i would offer is to make sure it fits your grill. its a big cover and not very adjustable. fits my char-broil grill perfectly but it would look ridiculous on a smaller grill. the only features i would wish for here are a loop or hook on the outside of the cover so i could hang it up when grilling instead of just draping it somewhere and a drawstring of some sort at the bottom to hold it closed. still it is so heavy and well made im certainly not complaining.

" i've used my smoker for 7 years now and i have nothing but great things to say about it. one recomendation is to drill a small hole in the top and insert a metal stem thermometer (about $7) for accurate monitoring of the smoking. you'll get the best results when you can hold the temps at the desired levels. it also comes in handy for checking internal temps of the meat. after 7 years the heating element broke and new ones are $40 through char broil. i'm appalled that they're so much and am contemplating buying another smoker instead.

" keeping this smoker up to temperature had been a chore until i invested in a heavy duty 25 foot extension cord. i bought a 12 gage 15 amp 25 foot chord and i'm now actually using the thermostat to back off the temperature. i got this cord at lowes and it cost around $18 dollars. the manual says to use a 50 foot or less cord with your smoker..but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can. also..thanks for the tip from a previous reviewer about drilling a hole at the bottom of the smoker to allow the excess water to drain out. got to go my ribs are almost done.

" i've owned this smoker for 6 years and have had great success turning out turkeys pulled pork ribs etc. couple of tips that took me some time to work out. 1) cover the water pan with some heavy duty foil after filling it. this'll prevent the liquid from boiling away too quickly. you won't have to refill it during the smoking and it'll prevent the smoker from getting too wet inside. when i left it uncovered i was getting steamed meat not smoked. 2) drill a hole in the bottom of the unit and get a drip pan underneath it. this'll allow any condensation to drip out rather than collecting in the bottom of the smoker and promoting rust. 3) get some heavy duty foil beneath the heater element. makes cleanup much easier and gets the heat reflected up to the food. have fun... ",positive
" pros : just drop in some wood chips fill the pan up and you are ready to go. very easy to use not much maintenance. i regulary pull out the electric element put in some charcoal and use it for roasting whole chickens roasts etc. i've even just used the bottom piece with charcoal as a grill and it's works great. you will be surprized how well the food comes out i have smoked a few hams and friends will tell me its amazing how that little smoker will cook. you do not need to spend a lot of time getting it fired up as a wood smoker and if you want you could smoke with only wood. cons : would like to see a temp guage on it. overall you cannot lose out with this smoker i live in a warmer climate so i have not experienced the problem of the smoker not getting hot enuoph at times if i want to speed things up i'll add some charcoal to it. can't beat it for the money and it does not have a very large footprint at all ",positive

" this unit is well-built will last and is easy to use. assembly is a breeze. we have had it almost two years and it performs superbly in all types of cooking-- it heats up quickly (and gets hot!) yet the flames can be turned way down and never blow out. we use it several times a week and a propane canister lasts about three to four weeks. of course if you turn all its mighty burners on and leave 'em that way it'll eat a lot of propane. but that kind of usage would quickly cremate anything you might be cooking. i suspect that people who complain about propane consumption with this barbecue are cooking with the hood up contrary to weber's instructions (and common sense). and let's face it any barbecue with six mighty burners like these will use its share of propane. pluses: thick solid stainless steel bars sear beautifully and will last forever. you want solid bars! the thermal inertia is key to good grilling. and stainless means no rusty taste no chipping and easy to clean. fine flame control. six burners let you configure the heat the way you want. the rotisserie and smoker box have thier own burners! the side burner works well too for cooking veggies and stuff in a pot. powerful yet capable of gentle cooking. won't rust. built like a tank. no cheap chinese componentry as often found in even formerly premium brands and all house brands most of which are made entirely in china even the big stainless-steel extravaganzas that sell for thousands. don't be fooled by fancy knobs and gewgaws-- the quality is just not there deep inside far too many barbecues today. i've personally witnessed two big top-of-the-line house brand barbecues returned to a leading warehouse retailer by irate purchasers who couldn't believe they'd crap out after a year. that never happens with weber. convenient fold-down work surfaces. easy to clean. huge cooking area. anti-flare burner configuration works well. lights instantly. easy to wheel around the yard-- something i wanted to be able to do and which a built-in wouldn't allow. fantastic weber service. mine was manhandled by the shipping company; weber handled my complaint with the shipping company for me (i didn't have to do anything at all) and sent me a new panel without any hassle at all. their 24-hour support hotline is the best i've used anywhere for any product and emails are handled same-day. negatives: expensive (but worth it). i'd buy it again in a heartbeat. it was my first weber after years of thinking they were only popular because they're stylish. now i get it. ",positive
" it's hard to do better than a weber and this grill has not disappointed in the two years i have owned it. i use it 3-4 times a week and have cooked just about everything you can imagine on it. i am very satisfied with its performance but it has a few minor flaws. i still have my genesis series propane grill that is still fine after 12 years but it was not big enough so i moved up. pros: stainless doesn't rust. large enough to cook a substantial amount using indirect method. last night i simultaneously grilled 4 t-bones 10 skewers of tequila-lime shrimp sweet peppers and bread. that's why i wanted this grill. i need room to cook. insulated box holds the heat well. first side burner i've had that actually works. assembly was relatively easy. strong rotisserie motor. spin a turkey or 3 chickens; no problem. the smoker box w/ its own burner is a great feature. stainless grates are better than any others i have used in past. lots of shelf space w/ fold-down shelves. battery-fired push button starters for all burners is easy and reliable in all weather conditions. cons: expensive. but i do expect a long service life. gas guzzler. more than one tank is helpful. couldn't find a cover that fits it. but it is stainless... gas gauge doesn't work that well but no biggie. the bottom of the cookbox has warped a little resulting in the grates being loose and shifting more than i'd like. on occasion when cleaning the grates they will fall into the bottom of the cookbox. i can work around this and probably fix it without too much trouble but it does tick me off. this cost them my 5th star; i expected better. so i pretty much love this grill and it's a good thing because i believe i'll have it for a good long while. chad the weird chain on the door is for manually lighting the grill. it is a match holder on a chain attached to the door so you won't lose it. go figure ",positive
" overall this is an outstanding grill. i've had it for a year and it's been awesome. it gets hot quickly it sears food well and it has all the bells and whistles. the stainless steel grates are the primary reason to get the platinum and not the gold. they are worth it unless you want to use plain cast iron and constantly oil them (which also you'd have to buy). a couple of things to consider though: 1. the design is kind a retarded for the smoker box. using the smoker box and the rotisserie is chore you can't really open the smoker box because of the spit and the smoker box seems to want to rely on the grates (which i remove to use the rotisserie) so with the grates gone it will tip over easily. 2. the grill has blown out a few times. i think this is due to the fact that i don't follow the instructions and turn the gas off when i'm done using it i just turn the grill off. so the regulator has a protection mechanism that gets tripped and off the grill goes. so i've changed the way i use it and it hasn't blown out since. 3. there are these weird chains in the doors of the cabinet. i have no idea what they are for and no one has been able to tell me. so if i had it to do over again i'd get the exact same grill it's worth every single penny. ",positive
" this grill has it all six burners a side burner a rotisserie with infrared burner and a smoker box with a dedicated burner. the grill grates are 3/8 stainless steel rods that provide great grill marks on your food. the grill heats up to 600 degrees in less than 10 minutes but it does burn through propane rather quickly but that wouldn't be any different with any 60000 btu grill. i was able to put the grill together by myself in a little over an hour. the fit of the pieces was fantastic and the end result was an attractive incredibly stable grill. it has two pull-up counters with stainless steel inserts and a cabinet with stainless doors. so far i have made countless steaks dogs and chicken breasts that all came out the same due to the even temperature on the grill. my old charbroil would give me two raw breasts two good breasts and two overcooked breasts... not with this grill. i have also slowed cooked some ribs with the smoker box going and the meat fell off the bone. but the best meal yet was a rotisserie chicken that i prepared with a rub and injected with a marinade. the skin was crispy and the meat was tender and juicy. we'll be making many more of those chickens in the future. weber is a known commodity. they are built to last and given the quality of the components (with care) i expect this grill to last at least 15 years. many people end up having to get rid of their weber's after 10 12 15 years because the cart has rusted out but that's not an issue with this grill as the cart is constructed of 304 stainless steel. all in all a great grill that will last a long time. my only cons would be the propane consumption and maybe the size. it's probably a little too big for me and my family but it was the only weber that had all the features i wanted (mainly the rotisserie and the smoker box with burner). if they had a four burner model with those options i would have gotten that but alas the weber summit platinum d4 does not exist ",positive

" i've been watching silver a for a while thinking to buy it from amazon while it is on sale. but i finally decided to get it from a local ace hardware store. here is why: the pirces are not significant differrent between amazon and ace. but ace offered free assembly free delivery free gas refill. and the most important feature to me is: they allowed me to upgrade it to stainless steel cooking grates and flavorizer bar for only $20 extra. (which is $100 value on amazon.)with the regular grates and flovorizer bar you have to replace it in a couple of years and hard to clean. but the stainless steel type may last much longer and easy to maintain. so if you buy it from amazon you have to pay base price plus shipping cost self assembly gas refill upgraded cooking grates and flavorizer bar etc. the choice is yours ",positive

" i just bought a new genesis after owning my last one for 11 years. excellent product. there's plenty of product info on this page from amazon and the manufacturer so let me tell you a few things that i do to make my weber work best for me. -most importantly...keep it covered. amazon sells a cover...get it. not coving it will cut its life in half at least. -cover the funnel shaped grease drip pan with tin foil and change it regularly; otherwise build-up in the trap can catch fire and that does not make a steak taste very good. -change the disposable grease traps regularly (otherwise they start to stink). -get yourself a quality wire brush and use it before each use...not after. the build-up on the cooking grates after each use actually protects them from the elements. -before each use after you wire brush the grates put some cooking oil on some paper towels and wipe the grates down. -pre-heat the grill on high for at least 5 - 10 minutes; it burns off anything left over from the cleaning and makes the cooking grates nice and hot. -initiate cooking steaks chops any cuts of meat (even burgers...no not hot dogs) on just-over-medium heat for 2 minutes on each side and flip before cooking to your liking. this brief searing of each side locks in the flavor of your cut of meat. -cook with a closed cover; normal cuts of meat shouldn't take more than a total of 10 minutes (including the searing). -let your meat sit for up to 5 minutes before slicing (or biting into it!). this locks in the juices; if the juices are too hot when you slice (or bite) they'll run right out of your cut of meat. there you go. hope that helps. and don't forget to cover the grill after it cools. bon appetit!

" i'm happy with my grill. putting it together wasn't that hard. it took me under an hour also but one thing to note is that when putting on the right bar with the container make sure the container is placed properly before you completely jam in the bar or else it will be very difficult to remove the bar and properly place the container. the grilling was great flames were consistent. cleaning is a pain though but i think thats a pain for all grills. ",positive
" i put in two aa batteries went to sleep and the next morning woke up to find the time moon phase date and temp set and accurate. very cool product. i hang it on a wall about 8 feet up and have no problem seeing the display from 20' away and from an angle of 45-50 degrees. it is not completely viewable from the sides but there is no annoying ticking and it beats my $10 ikea analog clock hands down. good for a small apartment. ",positive
" this sofa is a complete bargain. it's stylish in design and comfortable. the cushion is firm and supportive. the colour and texture of the all-weather wicker is fantastic. it's strong standing up to our kids yet light and easy to move around. it arrived very promptly and i'm delighted ",positive
" purchased this cover to protect my new weber q300 grill. fits like a glove! strong durable construction and superior protection. ",positive
" this is a very nice cover it is heavy-duty and vented at the rear of the top. others say this cover fits tight- and it does but i can get it on and off by myself. the trick is since the cover is a little stiff you can hold it with one hand above the grill while you use your other hand to guide it on to the grill. then it slides down and fits properly. it looks awesome- really sets my grill apart from my neighbors' unkept grills! :) ",positive
" do yourself a favor and give yourself this gift- a beautiful cover for a great grill. this is absolutely the nicest grill cover i've ever seen and i've paid 3 times this for flimsy ones. i don't agree that it is too snug it slipped right over with no tugging looks very neat and tailored but i don't like the big billowy ones anyway. excellent deal prompt shipping. ",positive
" well i like the cover but i it is hard to put on. i hoped that it would slip over the grill easily. it does not it is a tight fit. the quality of the cover is excellent. i just wish they made it a little larger so that it would go over the grill easier ",positive
" on my porch in my backyard there used to be tons of annoying insects flying around because we live very near to a pond and we have woods. ever since i got this terrific product i have been bug free for almost 3 months now!i can go back to having bar-b-ques again! this is the most amazing product ever created ",positive
" basic smoker but an outstanding value for the price. arrived before expected well-packed easy assembly. smokes efficiently although the temperature gauge never goes to ideal. i'm very pleased with this product ",positive
" the weber grill cover was easy to use. i would recommend this grill cover for anyone wanting to protect their weber grill. it fits the grill very well and is easy to clean. ",positive
" when you buy a weber you want to protect it and the weber premium grill cover is a wonderful way to do just that. it fits like a glove and is very durable ",positive
" you can't beat it when all you do is unwrap it and use it! the cover is a high quality perfect fit product (odd shape and all) that looks great and fully protects the grill. i highly recommend it&gt ",positive
" what is great about the salad greens seed kit is the aerogarden. the instructions make everything very easy and it has been such a pleasure to watch the tiny seedlings pop up. watching the greens leaf out waiting for them to grow large enough to start harvesting was such a pleasure and then to snip off leaves right in the kitchen to toss into our salad bowls was a real treat - and healthy! we are now watching baby herbs sprout! ",positive
" this product was an exact replacement for the original grates. they are great however if i had to do it again and i could find one i might have gone for an upgraded quality grate ",positive
" exactly the same as the original grates that came with the bbq. arrived fast and packed well. ",positive
" amazon service and weber quality. my grill is up for another 15 years of great grilling ",positive
" i thought these grates weren't good enough to sears meat boy was i wrong. the beautiful lines on the meats got me great reviews from my guests. easy to clean too ",positive
" this umbrella's quality belies its bargain price. it assembled easily and opens/closes smoothly. the construction seems sturdy and the fabric smelled freshly laundered when it came out of the shipping crate. my only complaint and it's almost trivial is the resin finial faded rather quickly in the sunlight. i'm overall quite pleased with the product and i'm looking for places in my yard to utilize more of these ",positive
" very stylish - i bought two - one for the office and one for home. no problems with either of them but i have not checked to see how accurate they are.. ",positive
" great price on this unit. saw the same one locally for $159.00 and not the color wood i needed. followed directions and works great. the package was new and item was as advertised nib. amazon must have gotten a buy on this wood color as it is cheaper than same units with different wood ",positive
" we replaced an old larger and broken sunbeam bug snapper with this unit. this is lighter and easier to handle. we're in southern arizona so our bug season is just starting. the unit works great but upon encountering a really big moth it sizzles for as long as ten seconds . . . kind of gruesome. if you're dealing with night-flying insects this is the solution ",positive
" i would recommend this product over to others. no complaints ",positive
" i bought this item based upon the reviews i read and i must say it lived up to the reviews. it did the job. i bought this late in the summer but the one time i used it i was impressed by the amount of bugs that it zapped in a short space of time. i saw and felt the effectiveness of the product because i stayed in the backyard longer than usual ",positive
" i have used flowtron products for years. this year coudn't find one locally and purchased another brand ! lated one month and had to replace the bulb. the new bulb lasted less than a month. total cost was twice that of a flowtron bk-40. the flowtron bk-40 will last one year 24-7 year around. like a car weather and age takes it's toll. but you'll need to clean the dead critters off every other week. finally found a flowtron on amazon. thanks no critters around my house big or small ",positive
" my husband and i recently moved to a very rual area between two national forest in nca and were being eaten alive by bugs of all kinds. we purchased two of these units and it has made a significant reduction in the bug problem for us. we would suggest this to anyone who has a bug problem and enjoys the outdoors. ",positive
" this is my second bug zapper. took another brand back that didn't work. this zapper is working great and that's all thanks to its intelligent design. some bug zappers have super small entry holes and then wimpy little electrodes inside. this zapper is designed to let bugs fly in easily and it has vertical electrodes that zap bugs. this zapper works really well...in fact the other night it was zapping like crazy because it was hot and the bugs were out. we live in an urban area near a plant nursery so we'd always have bugs coming in the back door. now this zapper kills them and attracts them away from our backdoor. great product ",positive
" this thing works great. i prefer to keep bottled beer on hand so i never had a chance to make beer can chicken. the chicken i cooked came out perfect. crispy skin and juicy inside. excellent! i'm going to dry lemon juice and wine next time. the bottom tray holds all the grease so your grill stays clean. highly recommended ",positive
" this product is great for the following reasons: 1 - stability (your chicken won't fall over during the cooking process as with just a standard can) 2 - quality is wonderful (not flimsy and cheap) 3 - dishwasher safe (easy to clean) 4 - not too big (so that it takes up the whole grill) 5 - priced well compared to other similiar products 6 - no worries where the can has been and what inks might come of ",positive
" this is an awesome grill for tailgating. it's easy to pack up and cooks great ",positive
" to the reviewers who report that the grille doesn't get hot enough the slightest breeze blows the flame out and you should need to stock up on extra gas cannisters i would point out: this review is for the charcoal model!! once the coals are fully going on mine nothing short of hurricane katrina could blow them out and with the proper amount of charcoal loaded in you have all the heat you'll ever need. i have nothing but praise for mine. nice going weber ",positive
" set up easily stores easily transports easily. for grilled meals for two [skewered food sausages steaks burgers fish corn on the cob] it has grilled more efficiently for us than our big bbq. the folding legs keep the direct heat off any surface underneath. with this efficient little griller we're enjoying patio cook-outs much more frequently than before ",positive
" i bought the grill for father's day and found it a great purchase. i've been thinking about getting a new grill but forking over hundreds of dollars for a standup felt a bit much. even though the price of the go-anywhere grill is cheap it is pretty solid. i've only used it once so far but it works nicely. i can fit 4 ears of corn on the grill 16 chicken wings or 6 teriyaki beef skewers. it took a few minutes to assemble the grill and is brain dead simple. the best part is the portability. i used it for the first time today and as the meat was starting to cook it started to rain. thanks to the unpredictable northeast weather. since the grill is portable i picked it up and moved to the garage. try that with a standup grill. i would gladly recomment the grill to friends and famil ",positive
" this grill is the greatest for simplicity and ease of use. it is compact and portable so there is no unsightly grill always hanging around your house or patio. i use it in summer and winter and even set it up in the snow. if you do charcoal grilling exclusively as i do this grill has the flexibility to adjust the combustion air and exhaust to suite what you are cooking. for high temperatures such as for steaks i leave the top cover off. takes perhaps 5 to 6 grillings before one learns all the right charcoal loadings and vent adjustments necessary. cools off totally in 15 minutes if you close all vents. ",positive
" we purchased a new go-anywhere charcoal grill to replace one exactly like it that has lasted 15 years with usage 3-4 times weekly. the absolute best choice for perfection barbequing. ",positive
" we are pleased with our recent purchase. we were surprised that it came through the us mail service. it did have a broken part that we believe is used on the cord to open the umbrella. ",positive
" it is a great umbrella. very straight forward to put together and easy to use ",positive
" the umbrella i ordered is fine just what i had hoped it would be. however i subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. as a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. i have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store. any suggestions ",positive
" the umbrella was quite a score through amazon - including the shipping & handling. it was still cheaper than walmart! lol......additionally it is of great quality. we utilize this umbrella for our bistro table and our porch now is all green. it is sturdy and even withstood being blow over with tropical storm tammy! twice ",positive
" these are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed. i like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella -- very low tech and smart. my one issue with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for -- they are totally stationary and don't have a tilting feature. that might be standard i just don't know but i would have wanted that flexibility. oh and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible. and they're simple to put together and take apart. great price and they block the sun and look terrific ",positive
" bought this umbrella last week (9/23/05) from amazon. was initially hesitant about purchasing it due to other reviews describing the issue with the pole being in two pieces which when connected were never straight. all i want to add here is that i did not experience this problem. the screw mechanism which joins the poles seems sturdy and the pole appears perfectly straight. i wonder if other people had bought umbrellas from a bad batch or that the manufacturer redesigned the connection mechanism? (the most recent reviews do not mention this problem) re. overall quality i can't speak for how the pole or the umbrella itself will wear over time but at least initially it looks to be of good quality and sturdy construction. one thing to note is that despite the product description and picture making it look like the pole is made of wood it appears to be actually made of some sort of metal which is wood coloured (it still looks like wood though and would not look out of place with wooden patio furniture). to be honest i actually prefer this since i would imagine it won't discolour as easily as natural wood and should be longer lasting. in summary am very pleased with my purchase - i would happily recommend it to others looking for a good quality umbrella at a very reasonable price ",positive
" had enough of cheap looking patio umbrellas that tear and bend after 3 or so thunderstorms? try this one! very nice designlooks great simulated wood finish pole easy open and close. we are very satisfied ",positive
" i checked multiple sites and manufacturers for this type of product. we are totally pleased with what we received. the construction and fabric are all that we could have wanted at much more cost ",positive
" we ordered the umbrella to replace one that we had for many years. when the product arrived we were surprised at the quality of the product for such a small price. we are very satisfied ",positive
" i purchased two of the 9-foot oxford garden market umbrellas in desperation; we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out. when they arrived a short time later i was very pleased to see how well made they were. i especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas. not only are these umbrellas attractive they are easy to use study and detail-oriented. i'll probably get one more before the end of summer ",positive
" my old grill was well over-due for replacement and so i started doing some research into a replacement. my previous grill was a coleman and had lasted a good 10 years although the cooking quality had definately deteriorated. i was going to purchase another cheapy grill but in my research i noticed something - almost every weber owner rated their grill 5-star whereas the cheapies usually mustered three stars at best. a little more research quickly pointed out why - webers may not last any longer than the cheaper competitors but a 10-year old weber still cooks better than the cheap ones do when brand new. i invested in the platinum c. but have yet to use the side-burner so i'm not sure how valuable that is. i was delighted with the quality of the grill - it was easy to assemble and the cooking quality is - fantastic. i purchased a weber griddle and i also have a pizza stone and with these two additions i cooked 8 meals in a row on my weber including bacon and eggs home-made bread pizza and of course grilled steak ",positive
" my 15 year old son put the grill together while i was as work. the grill has a very even heat distribution and very good heating controls. i have cooked steak at high temperatures and chicken at low temperatures. all items have come out great so far. the stainless steel cooking surfaces and internal parts appear like they will last along time. my last weber grill lasted for about 12 years. i expect that this one will do as well or better. my only disappointment was that this grill did not come configured for quick-connects like the last grill did. it uses the standard screw type connection for the gas bottle ",positive
" i heard that this grill was only 36000 btu and was not as hot as some other grills. believe me this puppy is plenty hot if all you are going to do is cook food! disregard this btu rating. this btu rating is rubbish. this grill will transfer so much heat to your food so fast that if you're not used to cooking with a high-quality grill you will turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol (i used a custom-cut 3-inch porter house to break in my new grill and to my surprise it was closer to well done than i prefer but still delicious!) everything is high-quality. it is much more solid than all the other grills i looked at and the grill is very even in terms of heating. besides it is beautiful. the side burner was not something i was really interested in but i just went for it. i used it the first time. this is the grill you need ",positive
" at first the thought of spending $750 on a grill seemed insane. then i started adding up all of the $250-$350 grills i've had to buy in the 7-years i've owned my home. based on reading hundreds of reviews i figured that a stainless steel grill made by weber would be the last grill i'd have to buy. i think i might be right. i bought the natural gas version which i would highly recommend. no more messing around with propane. just turn on the valve and you've got flame. i've had the grill outdoors for 4 months now (somtimes covered sometimes not) and there are no signs of any corrosion anywhere. the stainless steel cleans easily and polishes up nicely. the drip catch system is higher quality than i've seen with a ceramic coated 'funnel' that drains juices down to the tin catch pan. nothing collects near the flames so flare-ups are minimized. the 'flavorizer' bars immediately incinerate any grease that falls on them. the grill is easy to dismantle for cleaning. the front-to-back burners provide perfectly even heat and a lot of it. the thermometer on the grill easily spins past the highest marking of 600 degrees. at these temperatures steaks sear nicely and the grill is almost 'self cleaning' since any stuck-on food is almost completely incinerated. anything that remains on the grill easily scrapes off the stainless steel grates. the front-to-back burners also allow you to use the grill like an oven. by shutting off the center burner you can use indirect heat to cook food without searing it. the insulated hood keeps heat inside which makes the grill more efficient but also makes it easier to stand next to while cooking (not much heat radiates around the grille). i'm convinced that this grill is an excellent investment ",positive
" i did buy this grill in a store and now that i search amazon for acessories i find that it is a lot cheaper here. it is a good grill the way it works but the quality is lacking. many parts are not as sturdy corrosion resistant or easy enough to clean as i would expect. ",positive
" i love it! it's a bit of work to maintain but it's an awesome grill that cooks everything (once i figured out how to cook and got a good grill cook book). i bought two propane cylinders and just swap them out when the gauge that they hang on says it's a at a quarter tank. it's worth the price ",positive
" i have been through atleast 3 grills prior to this one. i was the type of person that would buy the $200 job from sears or something and figure i'll get about five years out of this one. never did. 2-3 seasons tops. this grills you know will last. solid stainless steel warranties that are more than a couple of months. its built to last and gaurenteed to last aleast five years. it will be worth every penny you spend. ",positive
" i owned a weber for almost 20 years before weather began to takes its toll. this one is works just like the last one and i hope to get a least that much wear as it is stainless and my last one was not. ",positive
" a fully cooked-fall apart pork butt in less that 2 hours. you'll think you died and went to heaven. easy assembly easy clean up. put a whole chicken on and you will never fry chicken again ever ",positive
" i've had much fun using the rotisserie and my first attempts a turkey and a pork roast were quite good! i anticipate excellent results as i gain experience. one caveat it doesn't make sense to buy this unless you plan to cook 10-15 lb roasts. the instruction booklet doesn't provide much in the way of cooking guidance or recipes but there's lots of both on the internet. i suspect that using a rotisserie is easier w/a gas grill but i've been using charcoal for many many years...and that's that ",positive
" wood chips and this rotisserie you are missing one of the great pleasures in life. well made and built to last years... ",positive
" i like this rotisserie's quality ease of use and functionality. the rotisserie fits my weber performer grill (which i also like a lot) perfectly which is no surprise since it's made specifically for weber's 22 1/2 inch kettle grill. the spit has a nice chrome finish as do the forks and appears that it will last. this is my first rotisserie unit and perhaps this might be common knowledge but after using it a few times i found that using the balancing weight works best by first putting your bird or roast on the spit then inserting the loaded spit in the ring without the weight tightened down or inserted in the motor so that the spit may find its own balance which naturally will have its heavy-side down. next i tighten the weight opposite of this heavy side insert it in the motor & turn it on. i then play with the positioning of the weight relative to the spit but remaining opposite of the heavy side so that it spins with the least amount of strain to the motor. (hope that wasn't too wordy.) anyway i've cooked chickens a roast and a 12 pound turkey (hoping to cook a big honkin' turkey soon) all with great success. in conjunction with the rotisserie i've finally discovered the canjun injector the hypodermic needle-like flavor injector. using both brings out juicy and flavorful foods. one other tip...carfully open and keep the box that the rotisserie came in for storage. i put some self-stick velcro on the box ends and it keeps this otherwise awkward to store gizmo safe and stack-able. i plan to buy another rotisserie unit for my weber gas grill. i don't know why but in addition to the more succulent outcome of the food seeing your food spin around the fire adds to the anticipation of the meal ",positive
" you may wonder why it took me 20 years to write this review... well after using this rotisserie for all that time the motor finally stopped working. so i got a new motor this week. and i'm ready to go. i have cooked just about anything you can put on a stick. as everyone says the results are just phenomenal. i've done 16-21 lb turkeys standing rib roasts leg 'o lamb pork roasts chickens duck goose you name it i've cooked it. just put the food on add a few hot brickets every so often and let her go. one tip there are two ways to cook with this. if you want even heating don't take the lid off too often. releasing the heat with the lid off you lose the convection effect but that's not all bad. for some meats like leg of lamb where you want the outside crisp keeping the lid off works well if you stoke your fire to keep it hot. finally weber's customer service is phenomenal ",positive
" 1st i've read a thousand reviews and this is my first yeah and maybe last. i've had it 3 months and after month #1 it deserved 3 stars. after month 2 earned 4 stars.... now top rated. it does chicken best. the lid (a con) doesn't fit tight on the rotisserie ring so the fire burns hotter than i would like. so.... this is what i do: 1- skewer 2 chickens thru the chest-back at an angle. then season with a dry garlic herb (or lemon pepper). if you season first then most is removed when skewered. seperate the chickens with an onion or potato. don't tie. 2- center the charcoal 6 wide across the center of the kettle from side to side. when the fire is 1/2 started put the chickens above the flame. the fire will burn fully because the lid doesn't seal (remember?). the flavor is where the flame meets the chicken. no other way will work.. 3- cook for about 45 minutes or til the skin pulls away from the end of the chicken legs. looks burnt? the skin might be but the inside is great. trust me. take it off the grill and let it rest about 20 minutes. flame still going?? skewer some red or white potatoes. tastes great and sooo moist! pack leftovers in a sealed plastic bag and it will keep a week. ok i am guessing on that part. mine only lasts a few days.. another con is the cost. it should have included a skewer length basket for holding ribs fish etc. so this is the end of my review. i have bought some junk on the 'net..... but this one of my better choices. jc tamp ",positive
" the ring and motor do what they are supposed to do. the ring did not fit very well at first it was able to rock back and forth. however after a little bending into shape it fit more snug. the way the ring rests on the kettle there will alway be some gap which does not allow for a good seal. i not only use this as a rotisserie but also to give me more room for beer can chicken. its worth getting it for the added flexibility. ",positive
" my wife bought me this for me a couple years ago. i think she had an ulterior motive: for me to make the thanksgiving turkey when all of her family came to visit. i did and it was simply outstanding! i have done several turkeys chickens and roasts on this rotisserie and they all turned out perfect with very little effort. if you have a 22.5-inch weber kettle you need this rotisserie ",positive
" this is by far the best grill accessory i have every gotten. it cooks chickens to perfection and keeps them juicy moist and tender. i haven't tried cooking anything else but i'm sure whatever it was it would come out great. i would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a weber charcoal grill ",positive
" i bought this after calling weber to find out if it would actually fit my summit gold c4. it does...and that is what mattered to me. i can't comment on durability as i just got it but it does feel heavy enough to withstand a beating ",positive
" this cover is extremely heavy duty and has survived many windy thunderstorms and still good as new after a year and a half. it is still going strong still good as new ",positive
" bought a nice grill wanted/needed a cover works well. a bit ackward but does the job ",positive
" just purchased the weber platinum b4 grill(should have bought that through amazon too thats another story) so i needed the cover to keep it nice. bought it on a saturday and arrived on a wednesday. very nice cover very thick almost rubber like vinyl cover. they have improved the cover since the last one i received from weber. they have enlarged the opening in a way to allow the cover to easily fit over the grill this is huge really it used to be like wrestling alligators to get the cover over the grill now it almost falls over the grill and hangs there. anyway in summation it is very thick fits and installs really easily and looks great absolute necessity for investment of a grill thats now over a thousand dollars ",positive
" exactly what i was looking for. very heavy duty and the fit was perfect ",positive
" this pest repeller works great in my attic repelling squirrels. the squirrels have broken in three times and are gone within 15 minutes. i would not use this inside the house because it does make a constant chirp sound. i can't hear this noise in the attic so i will buy another when this wears out.

" plain and simple - very effective. i plugged this device in to the wall in my office in a school. within seconds the roaches in our kitchen area ran into the hallway. they have not been seen since. there have not been any mouse droppings around either. ",positive

" this is a solid body storage building exactly as advertised. my goal was to store a mower trimmer blower gas and miscellaneous items. i had to build a shelf (not included) notch it to fit and install it before putting roof in place. it works great for gas and miscellaneous items leaving room for taller items but they must be tilted some. if you have a mower with retractable handles (which i do not) it will fit in this building. (so mower is still out) other than that it has cleared up the mess in the back and locks the flammables up too. be careful to read instructions because it would be very difficult to take pieces apart after clicked into place. if you are planning to store a mower i would recomend a larger unit just for ease of use. this one is great for a lot of gardening supplies but i think they should provide at least 2 or more shelves ",positive
" you can put up to 6 shelves inside to fully use all the cubic space available. but you may just need 4 and leave the lower two open for big size items to be stored. rubbermaid has a similar size shed but it can only accept three shelves and waste a lot of spaces. the rubbermaid shed uses much fewer pieces to assembly than this one. the assmbly is pretty easy if you follow the manu but it does take some time (1-2 hours). after i finished the assembly there were some rain and the inside was try except a couple of water drops. the only concern is its sturdiness since it's assembled with 28 pieces and so far so good. i don't expect it can stand a ternado or hurricane. one thing i wan to alert you: when you buy the shelves do measure the inside and ignore the manu since if you buy the side according it yuo will find the shelves will shift too much to the left or right. you want them more stable right? recommended. ",positive
" this cover works very nicely with my grill - it fits well and appears to be fairly good grade material. i have no complaints ",positive
" protecting your grill is important if you leave it outside all the time. this is by far the best grill cover we have had. it is easy to put over the grill the velcro straps keep it from flying off it fits the genesis s-320 perfectly and it is heavyweight. recommended definitely ",positive
" i tried another rotisserie i got from an auction and was sadly disappointed. the mounting brackets did not fit there was no counterweight and the meat forks were cheaply made. this unit however is great. first the mounting brackets are truly universal and should fit just about any grill. mine mounted perfectly on my aussie bonza deluxe 3 grill without issue. installation only takes about 5 minutes. the mounting brackets allow for various distances between your grill's mounting holes and multiple sets of holes allow for various height adjustments. if your grill has two holes on either side you should be set. the single-piece spit rod is heavy duty the counter weight included is heavy enough to assist with balancing heavier roasts (or chickens) and the four-pronged meat forks are well made. the motor comes with a long cord (about 3 feet- most other units have much shorter cords!) and the fact that the motor has an on/off switch is a nice plus. lastly for all the praise i can give this unit i was also pleased that it's attractively priced. i have seen many other rotisseries that seem to be much more expensive and not built nearly as well ",positive

" this a very basic smoker. it is well built. easy to assemble w/ good instructions. not much information on the actual smoking process but the internet is full of information. no information on how to adjust the vent to make it run cooler or hotter. do not think it should matter w/ gas. it might just regulate the amount of smoke. i leave mine 1/2 open. runs to hot for a smoker when set as the instructions recommended gas valve 1.5 turns open. i have mine less than 1/3 of a turn open to achieve 225deg. it took some trial and error to figure out how to get the temp low but once you figure it out the gas smoker works great. would have been 5 stars if knob on the smoker was able to adjust the temp low enough. i keep mine pegged on low ",positive
" i purchased this smoker last summer. the assembly was simple. one piece of hardware was missing but had no trouble replacing the nut that holds the thermometer in place. i replaced the factory regulator with an adjustable unit and can get any level of heat i desire. it is sensitive to wind though. ",positive
" i found this smoker to be great. i am not a pro so take my opinion as such. i bought this last week and put it together in about a 1/2 hour. the only problem i had was that a flimsy weld on the control panel broke which meant it did not hook onto the bottom of the smoker neatly. it was nothing a little electrical tape could not fix and was probably my fault for forcing it. i plan on fixing it with a bolt and nut later this week. the rest of the unit looks well built. as far as smoking it did great. i put some garlic and water in the water pan a mix of apple and mesquite in the wood chip bin and put the smoker on low. as long as i had the vent wide open it stayed at 175 f. if i closed the vent the temp got up to 200 f. the whole chicken i cooked was great. after four hours of smoking on my back patio the chicken was moist and had a delicious hint of bbq. it was smoking pretty good for a couple of hours. my wife had doubts about me buying a smoker. now she has a bbq menu planned for next week. all in all i would recommend this to a friend. it is easy to use and keeping the heat consistent throughout the smoking is very easy with the propane controls and the vent ",positive

" this sonic pest repeller works a lot better than others. it will keep away a lot of rodents and decrease the number of spiders drastically. you will start to see less and less spider webs and it does not make a whole lot of noise. i would define tally recommend this over other sonic pest repellers and is well worth the money for how much of a decrease in insects and creatures ",positive

" the only complaint i have with my gas smoker is that it was damaged when delivered (this was also the case of a friend of mine who ordered the same smoker)it was dented in several places. i have cooked as many as 12 whole chickens at on time and they all came out fully cooked and juicey. it's a great way to cook. just put your meat on adjust your heat then set back and visit with your guest while the smoker does all the work. after people have tasted my smoked faire they always ask where i got my smoker. several of my friends have bought this smoker for their own use ",positive
" like several other reviewers my smoker also came badly damaged. i had bought this to use for a going away party and had planned on smoking 25 lbs. of ribs. when it arrived and i saw how badly damaged it was i immediately e-mailed amazon and they shipped me a replacement the next day. my replacement also came damaged (worst than the original). it was one day before the party and i had no choice but to use it even though it was damaged. i must say the ribs turned out great. i am very impressed with this smoker and it's ease of use but had to return them due to the amount of damage both units had. i believe this smoker is well worth the price and would give it 5 stars if they would just package it better. i also give 5 stars to amazon for it's great customer service. ",positive
" this smoker works like a charm! the only regret i have is that it is a bit larger than i expected i should have bought the next size down. other than that the times i have used it the results were great. temperature is easy to control and that was the main concern as i wanted sometime i didn't have to babysit while i was smoking my ribs or pork shoulder. others have complained about receiving the units damaged i guess i was lucky there was a slight crease in one corner but i was able to straighten it out easily. better packaging would be an improvement. my .02 is that it is well worth the investment ",positive
" i bought the great outdoors deluxe gas smoker for my first smoker and the first time i used it i cooked two pork boston butt's. i have never used a smoker before and i was worried about the heat fluxuating(i think thats how you spell it)alot. once i got the heat set(in about 20 minutes) i put the two pork butt's on and left it till the next morning. i woke up and checked the temp and it was perfect. everyone who had some of my smoked pork thought i was a proffesional at smoking with my great outdoors deluxe gas smoker. i am doing some beef brisket this weekend to see how it turns out. alot of people have been saying that thier smoker was in bad shape because of the packing from the manufacturer but the smoker i bought from lowe's was packed in a cardboard box with foam supporting everything and nothing was damaged or scratched on my smoker. i would recommend this smoker for anyone that wants a very good and easy to use smoker. oh yeah' it's also easy to clean! ",positive
" the great outdoors deluxe smoker is exactly what i was looking for. the lp gas is great for easy temperature control. all i need to do while smoking is periodically check the level of liquid in the pan (and add more wood chunks if desired). the temomitor is easy to read and appears to be made of good quality. the only complaint i have is the smoker is not foam protected inside the cardboard box when shipped. thus my smoker had two minor dents in the corner of the smoker. they do not affect the operation at all.

" down here in southern mississippi you can sit inside with the ac in summer or hang a hammock in the shade - but this is my best one ever and probably my last one since it's so lightweight i prefer to carry it in out of the weather even though it's so durable. i've had several rope hammocks to replace each year but this durable fabric one cannot be beat. the grandbaby loves it ",positive
" the hammock is a great choice if you like sharing it with you significant other or by yourself. it's very sturdy and comfortable even with two adults. the quality of hammock is good and worth the price especially compared to other models we looked at ",positive
" we have an original hatteras rope hammack which we purchased when we lived in north carolina. i love it but the rope tends to stretch too much and requires rehanging to tighten it. we were informed that it would when we purchased it four years ago but now it seems to be more work than it is worth. the solid quilted design seems like it would be better and would require less maintenance. also our poodle-mix pet just loves it. she would try to jump in before we could even get it hanged. we had to attach a cover to it to keep her paws from going through the ropes so that adds to the value of the solid design.thanks for listening to me and we plan on purchasing the guilted hammack as soon as possible ",positive
" i got this hammock back in november so i don't know if this hammock will be good for summer but it is the perfect hammock for winter! my fiance and i could nap in it all afternoon with a couple of pillows and a blanket in the middle of winter. it is very comfortable even with 2 people on it. the surface seems to be semi water resistance. we left it out in the rain a few times and most of the water stay on top of the surface. we just turn the hammock dump out the water and it dried under the sun in a few hours. i read somewhere that the green stripes will fade over time but i can live with it ",positive
" this is a very neat hammock. it is very comfortable and easy to get in and out of. it does of course not allow air to flow through like a rope hammock but is so much more comfortable. i also bought the matching pillow and really enjoy the lazy summer evenings now. i roll mine up and bring it inside when i'm not using it which is quick and easy to do and will make it last that much longer. it will hold to adults but is a little crowded ",positive
" i use my hammock about 75% of the year and find it extremely comfortable. it was bit expensive but i guess in the long run it will be worth it. i have had mesh hammocks that only last one season. i think this one is going to last for years ",positive
" this bbq tool set is absolutely the top of the line and worth much more than i paid for it! all the tools are heavy wood with rubber grips and heavy stainless steel. even the case is made to hold up for a long time. i was truly impressed when i received it ",positive

" my husband was very pleased with this set. it is the best one yet. the handles are great to grip and the set is easy to use. they wash clean easily. this is a great product. i would recommend it to anyone who loves to grill ",positive
" i'm new to the world of smoking and ordered this for when i dont feel like doing the whole charcoal thing. it works fairly well and the flavor is great but not quite as much as you get from using a charcoal grill. i think it was designed to be placed on either side of the grill...i've opted to slide the grates to the sides and place the smoker in the middle...it seems that less smoke escapes the grill this way. a worthwhile purchase ",positive
" i got my first weber (genesis b) and had to get the smoker and try 'er out. kinda wishing i saved my money and just got the smokey mt though... here is why: i got my grill at home depot so i would have the nice cast iron porcelin enamel coated grates. when using the smoker you must remove one grate and replace it with a supplemental smaller grate so that the smoker will fit on the side. this grate does not sear like the cast iron!!! weber also does not make a cast iron to fit this size so when using the smoker you only get 1/2 of a grill to make nice sears on. however i havn't taken it out since i bought it over a week ago so i guess the flavor is worth it. ;-) in regards to the previous review i have had no trouble smoking a pork sholder for 5 hours and the smoke was thick and rolling the whole time. i think the key is to soak the chips for a minimum of 30 minutes (i'll let them soak for hours if i think ahead). make sure you load up enough chips - i pretty much filled the tray up. shut the lid of the smoker!!! that part is key! especially when heating up the grill. when heating on high i've found it takes slightly under 10 minutes to start to smolder turn down the grill now! before it starts a full on smoke!! i wasn't going for low and slow... but wanted to maintain a 325 degree oven for the entire time. i checked the internal temp at 3 4 and 5 hours getting the pork up to an internal temp of 182 (figured it would rise another couple degrees after i took it off). the pulled pork was amazing! plus i got the pink ring!!! it was my first smoking experience and i fed 10 people with the recipe from weber nation (i doubled it). so long story short... if you already have the gas grill and don't want to invest another $300+ in a smoker... try it out! it may not be as great as the smokey mt. but it really smokes ",positive
" if you buy all three of these items individually from amazon.com they cost $11.50 less than buying them in this set! other than that i highly recomend these. i grill several times a week and these have been put to good use with no complaints ",positive
" the oxo line of cooking supplies is always a sure bet. if you want to look stylin' while you are out bbq'in this is a utensil set that won't let you down. the stainless steel was strong and sturdy - it cut right through a whole chicken and held it sturdy so i could transfer it from the bbq to the plate. great set i highly reccommend ",positive
" i always recommend the oxo line of tools to anyone that does a lot of cooking and wants something really designed for use. this is especially true for anyone with problems such as tendonitis arthritis or carpal tunnel -- these tools are all designed to leverage energy efficiently instead of wasting energy as most poorly designed utensils. try them out ",positive
" i bought this pillow because i just got a new hammock for my backyard and i felt it needed one. what else can i say for a hammock pillow? soft smooth fabric prefect for those weekend afternoon &quot;cat naps&quot ",positive
" i'm on my second mr. bar-b-q wood brush and as long as they keep selling it at the value price i imagine i will keep buying them. no they don't last forever-- eventually the bristles will get clogged with a greasy sludge (how long that is depends on the frequency of use) but while it lasts it does a fine job cleaning and scraping your grill. what sets it apart is the long handle and large head covered in brass bristles. while those bristles could stand to be a bit longer they are still longer than many. the scraper side is quite strong and does not bend or break easily. you get a lot for your money with this solid product which could last several seasons ",positive
" this is a product i was not sure about just from seeing the picture. once it arrived i was very pleased with my choice. the picture doesn't do it justice. it is very sturdy and the rubber grip helps too!!! great gift for a man or woman that loves to grill ",positive
" it's designed in germany and mfgd in china. i'd say definitely locate and purchase the extension kit. i did. i have a large guatemalan hammock that i've owned for years that's barely seen any use -- usually on camping trips. it finally occured to me to research and secure a hammock stand and it's really delightful to be able to laze in the hammock in the shade of the house on summer afternoons. i wish i'd bought one of these years ago ",positive
" after assembling the stand i was very pleased with my decision to purchase this one. i also ordered an extension thinking that for my mayan family hammock i would need to make it longer. but to my surprise the hammock fit perfectly without the extension and because the height of the stand can be adjusted pretty high you could put a longer hammock in it because of this. very heavy steel well enameled excellent workmanship and very easy to assemble. ***** - definitely a five star purchase ",positive
" i definitely need one in each room. we have one in each of the two bedrooms the living room and the kitchen. the only room i still see roaches in is the bathroom. i guess i should get one for that room as well... we definitely used to see big i'm-gonna-eat-your-baby roaches and i haven't seen one since we put these in. however.... we were just moving in and had been ripping cabinets and flooring out so they may have only surfaced due to our mild construction--which happened to end right about the time i put these in. final verdict? eh circumstantial evidence says they seem to work. ",positive
" in using this product i actually did find a mouse later in the kitchen caught by a trap. this product should be used in coordination with other devices to kill rodents and not depend on it alone. ",positive
" after college i moved back home for a few months before getting my own place. it was totally a sitcom setup in that i lived in my mom's basement - but the mice and spiders down there were not funny at all. i didn't really mind the mice running around every now and then but when one got under the covers with me i had enough. i went to a local brick & mortar store and bought all kinds of different traps deterrents etc to try to get them out or trap them without harming the critters (mom wouldn't have it). i bought a single two-pack of these things and immediately after i plugged the first one in i saw two mice immediately come out of their hiding spot and scurry to the unfinished part of the basement. having one in my bedroom and one in the bathroom in the basement was enough for me but mom's husband was so impressed that he bought about a dozen more for the rest of the basement (lots of separate rooms) and the garage. definitely read the tips and suggestions - they will only work if there is a large open space so put this in an outlet that has a full view of the room. each room will need it's own and a very large room (like a two-bay garage) will need two or three. we put these up about three years ago and there hasn't been a mouse in the basement since ",positive
" i recently moved into a house and was seeing spiders and centipedes on a regular basis so i decided to buy these to see if i could get rid of them. i've been using these for about 3 weeks in various rooms of the house and haven't seen a bug since. i have to say that they really seem to be doing what they're supposed to. i have used similar products like this in the past (not from black and decker) and have also found them to work so i believe that this technology actually works well for getting rid of pests ",positive
" i received this just a couple of days ago and it works awesome!! i grilled bite size veggies in this and nothing fell through the holes. i still had the grilled taste but no messy cleanup or a hot kitchen. excellent product! ",positive
" product is a must for bbq buffs. have nothing but good things to say re amazon merchants ",positive
" this cushion is extra long and extra thick - and should work with most any chaise lounge. it has really firm support. not one of those puffy things that go flat in one season. i highly recommend it. ",positive
" this lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every peny. it is thick comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion) available in several color choices and has a soft not plasticky cover fabric. you will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. it just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because i had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. but all turned out well and i must say i am very happy with it. it is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper but much thinner types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. get the best. this is it ",positive

" i love this clock. i won it as an incentive through my creative memories sales. i love that it is always set to the accurate time. my 4 and 6 year old love to tell me what time it is and at what phase of the moon it is presently (they always double check outside). it's been a great addition to our home.

" i ordered two orders which equals four chairs. the boxes are thick and double boxed. the chairs are placed one inside the other . . . all wrapped with paper around the legs arms and on top of the back. fairly light weight and solid frame . . . nothing to put together. the color is a low luster pretty taupe color with tiny specks of silver . . . very expensive looking. the cushions are a golden taupe color with an expensive weave pattern and piping around the edges top and bottom for structure. it feels durable and water proof. the back corners have velcro straps to hold the cushions in place. they can be neatly stacked. i'm extremely pleased with this order. thank you amazon ",positive

" i gave one to my nephew for christmas and he and everyone else has liked it so well that everybody in the family tried it out and i now have to order one for his mother and also one for my husband. the projection feature is great and the projection display is actually larger and brighter than i thought it would be. to be honest i have to mention the drawback - the display on the clock itself is so small and not backlit so you have to be pretty close to it to see the time during the day. until someone puts a projection feature on a larger size cd/alarm clock we will continue to keep our old alarm clock and put this one on the other side of the bed and use it mainly for the projection feature. even with the drawback mentioned we all love the clock. my nephew loves being able to see what time it is without putting on his glasses ",positive
" if you are the type that wakes up during the night and has to know the time this is the clock for you. i absolutely love it. no glasses necessary and i don't have to crane my neck to find the time. if you're a fanatic about exact time(i'm not) the atomic feature means you're always on schedule. i like this clock so much that i will be purchasing several as extra christmas gifts. its a great fun item too ",positive

" this griddle is very useful especially if you bring your grill to the camp site. the surface cooks evenly and if sufficiently heated does a good job. at first i thought it was solid cast iron but upon further inspection found that it has some kind of high temperature coating. my only criticism is that it isn't a more non-stick surface and food can be hard to clean off after use. the gee whiz factor is great when you whip it out around other people who have the little stamped metal travel grills. this item really rounds out the baby q's options. ",positive
" i'm used to using a teflon coated electric griddle that has much more space than the baby q griddle. cooking eggs and pancakes on the cast iron proved challenging and everything cooked much faster (too fast at first). the lack of a drain hole made cooking the bacon very greasy. it got to the point where i had to remove the bacon remove the griddle dump the grease and continue cooking. on the plus side the griddle fits perfectly and the included chrome handles make removing the griddle safe and effortless ",positive
" just got to use the weber baby q griddle. it worked great. the only complaint i have is that it could be bigger. it covers just a little over half of the available grill area. more would be better. other than that the design is excellent and it works great ",positive

" we purchased this item from uj's last august. ordered it 1:00pm on a monday; ups truck in our driveway on wednesday morning - no extra cost; just their standard shipping policy and shipping was free. it took my husband less than 1hr to put together on our back deck. everyone loves it. we've been using it ever since and have not had to take it down (it's now february - in pennsylvania - after 2 moderately bad snow and ice storms). we even used it for as the bar area for our christmas dinner party. it was cold and sprinkling rain outside and none of our guests got wet or had any complaint when stepping out to the enclosed patio to get their wine or spirit. we had enough sense to follow the suggestion and use the brackets that came with it to bolt it down to our deck. we've had 50-65 mph winds with and without rain and no problems. i am now online ordering another one from uj's for the side deck and addition to our home we will be building in the spring. thanks uncle joe's for superior service and quality products!

" the product work perfectly and the displays are very good. beaufiful and modern design ",positive
" this clock's display contains all the information necessary to prove that the time and date displayed are the actual time and date assuming the clock is in the radio-controlled mode (that is unless someone is willing to take extraordinary measures such as swamping-out the wwvb signal with an equivalent signal containing false data). according to the owner's manual the presence of the antenna icon indicates that the clock is in the radio-controlled mode. when this icon and the associated signal-strength bars are flashing the clock is in the process of synchronizing to the nist reference. if either two or four signal-strength bars are displayed there is sufficient signal for the clock to synchronize. if no bars are displayed it is not safe to assume that the clock is synchronized. the display also contains a time-zone map of the us with the selected time zone darkened and either am or pm next to the antenna icon thus eliminating two more reasons to question the displayed time. although the year is not explicitly displayed it can be derived from the display when the user chooses to display the day of the week instead of seconds.

" like the other reviewer i have this clock in my office - in my case in the middle of a warehouse. within 2 minutes the atomic clock had connected and set the time and date. it has been in wireless contact ever since (there is an icon to let you know) the time numerals are a little over 2 high and very clear - easy to read from 50' away. the day date and temp displays are about an inch tall and also very clear but since they are so much smaller they don't have quite the distance visability. it is nice to have a clock around that is always right - keeps my meetings on time - no arguement over whose watch is correct ",positive
" i recently purchased an orgeon scientific jm889na-s jumbo atomic wall clock with indoor temperature and have been delighted with it in every way. my main concern before it arrived was the brightness of the display. well this unit far exceeds my expectations ... it is very bright and is visible from a great distance. a lot of lcd displays that i have seen on clocks etc have been very dim and to me very unsuitable. another feature that this unit has is automatic time updates and i found that it not only works but works in my work place office. my office is an interior office (ie not located near any windows) and it is able to pickup the time signal through our building walls. this is amazing!! i have also found the jm889na-s to be very attractive looking and very well designed. five cheers for oregon scientific ",positive

" i bought these lounge chairs because of the other positive reviews i read on them. i have to say that i am very happy with them too. the color is a very nice antique color that matches the set we got a costco a few years back. i can't wait for those warm summer days and evenings to sit around the pool and enjoy lounging in these chairs. they are not too heavy so they will be easy to move around. they are heavy enough that the the santa ana winds we have here in beautiful southern california did not blow the chairs around at all. i think the price for these is a very good price for the value and would recommend them. i only wish you could pick your color for the material on the cushions. the beige color matches what we have but is a little drab since our house and patio cover are the same color. i see they sell replacement cushions in different colors but it would be nice to have a choice in color when ordering the originals ",positive
" i ordered 2 chaise and very happy with them. they are a little lighter in weight than i expected. also the image shows the metal a little lighter than what they are. the cushion looks beige in the photo and is actually more grey. besides all that they match very well with an ethan allen set that i have. delivery was fine and they arrived sooner than expected ",positive
" i wanted to mainly write this to address the shipping complaints below. we are redoing our deck and expanding it and after research thought this would be the best buy for a durable product. after reading the shipping complaints we put it on order right away- expecting to have it in the several weeks it would take for the deck. lo and behold- 3 days later they call my wife and ask to deliver it- any 4 hour window she wants- she picks the next morning and the next day when i get home there are 4 giant boxes in my garage spot when i get home. they are huge boxes and double boxed but luckily no styrofoam- still i had to take all the cardboard to the recycling center myself but at least very little was not recycleable. our deck is still not done so i can make little comment other than that the one i did set up in the living room seems study- the cushion is very thick and well made- but stiff- which may be the comment noted below (i assume he goes for very soft). i find it comfortable but may comment more when we have actually used them a bit. still given the shipping concerns noted is several comments i wanted to point out that if you have someone who can be home for a four hour window- it seems to be no problem. ",positive
" i thought when i ordered these chaise lounges (2) they would only be temporary until i could afford good ones because they were so inexpensive. well these are good and i don't need to replace them. the design actually matches my table set and i didn't even realize it until we unpacked them -- fully assemled! i only have one complaint and it's really not that bad. the thickness of the cushion seems fine for me but my skinny butt husband tells me the cushions aren't cushiony enough. other than that the chaises are absolutely wonderful and good quality ",positive
" everything about this collection is first class. the pictures on the site were accurate - i was glad i made the purchase - it saved me hundreds of dollars compared to the retail mark-up from my other distributor of patio furniture. i ended up purchasing the whole collection ",positive
" this chaise lounge made for the perfect addition to my deck. the cushion is durable thick and extremely comfortable with velcro 'ties' to keep the cushion in place (from sliding). it truly is a beautiful piece. there was a slight mix-up with the shipping but once everything was straightened out the lounger was delivered just as scheduled. the delivery guys even brought the box around to my backyard and on to my deck. the chair comes completely assembled. all you do is open the box and enjoy ",positive
" these lounge chairs are hands down the best deal that i have found. they are extremely comfortable sturdy and attractive! plus free shipping and they come already assembled..which is a big deal for me since i am not very handy!! great item and great deal all around ",positive
" this chaise lounge really exceeded my expectations. i'd shopped around and didn't want to spend $400 plus for a chaise lounge. this is a great price plus you get free shipping. they arrive completely assembled and well packaged. very attractive sturdy and most importantly very comfortable. i highly recommend. got the side table with ice bucket and love it as well ",positive
" this lounge chair (i bought two) exceeded my expectations for quality. i've been shopping retail stores for months and can tell you that you can't beat this deal! they are very sturdy and attractive. don't be in a big hurry as they would have arrived quicker on the back of a snail. you can't do better than free shipping but remember that you get what you pay for. i made 3 seperate appts. with shipping company to deliver these items. first there was a miscommunication second - they had no record of the appt. third - they finally arrived but after their promised delivery time. aside from the delivery frustrations i am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend these for your backyard. they look great on our pool deck ",positive
" lifetime has produced an extremely well made table. it is very sturdy. the top seem impervious to abuse. the legs are much more robust than any other i have seen. and they lock when folded a really nice feature. highly recommended ",positive
" this card table is very sturdy. the legs are solidly locked in place both when extended and when stored. the top appears to be durable. overall this appears to be a quality product ",positive
" i have a high ceiling so the display of the time was fuzzy and i missed the see-through case with the red night light on the earlier model but overall i was satisfied with the clock ",positive
" this little clock worked exceedingly well at first. clear large display that was bright enough to read but not so bright it was distracting at night. it takes up little space on a night table which is great. however if it's on your night table you'll have to angle it so that the clock face is nearly toward the wall as you can't adjust the projection. if you face the clock out toward the far wall the projection will be diplayed upside down. still i was okay with this as the projection was what i was interested in. and that worked great until it accidentally got knocked off the nightstand onto the carpet. one mishap and the projection was broken. nothing could fix it; you can't even open the clock to explore the mechanics of it. without the projection it's simply a procey bed-side alarm clock. it's my fault for knocking it over but i would think a clokc of this caliber should be a bit sturdier ",positive
" i love this clock because it has it all in a slick package for a good price. the battery lasts forever so it's portable the time sets itself atomically it shows the temperature has the obligatory annoying alarm clock the time lights up on the ceiling and it looks good to boot. very well-made and highly recommended. oregon scientific rocks ",positive
" i recently purchased this clock and it's a great little clock! the time and temp are cool features as well as the projection which is very cool and useful. the projection (usually on the ceiling) is not too bright to hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening. the only problem with the projection is that unless you have the clock on the side the numbers project upside down. i mean to say that if you have it facing you straight ahead the numbers will be above the clock upside down. the atomic feature was a bit tricky also. i live in central nj and when setting up the clock for the first time it didn't pick up any signal. after i searched for a signal took the batteries out and tried everything i knew and everything the manual mentioned it wouldn't get a signal. so i had to write an email to the company and they sent me a response with several suggestions the one that worked and was most useful was to search for a signal (by pressing the down arrow) and then while its searching place it where it can recieve full signal which is shown by the meter on the left like a cell phone. once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself (you may need to take it outside)...this can take from 10 mins to days. in my case it took about 5 mins. so it set the signal and the company says once it sets you can put it where you want and it will keep the signal. other than that problem which is fixed the clock is hassle free and very easy to use.i highly recommend it. oregon scientific was also helpful and i sent them a thank you email stressing that they need to put more signal suggestions in the manual because if they did i wouldn't have needed to bother email the customer service. hopefully most people didn't give up that easily and kept trying to get the signal to set if they didn't they may have returned the clock needlessly. the alarm is loud enough for me to awaken and the snooze button is useful and on the top so it's can be reached easily in a drowsy stupor. overall it's a cute useful and stylish clock. ",positive
" automatically sets and updates time/day/date with u.s. atomic clock does not work for me in washingotn dc ",positive
" purchased this so my 7-year old can wake up on his own for school. i checked several stores and was dissapointed to find nothing suitable for a child (didn't want radio cd telephone and other features). ** pros ** 1. very compact size fits good next to bed 2. ac adapter with battery backup (even came with batteries) 3. lcd display doesn't have annoying illumination while trying to sleep. blue glow activates only when very easy to find button is pressed 4. straight forward buttons and controls that took about 2-3 minutes for my 7-year old to learn. buttons are a good size and are not real hard to press. 5. great styling as a kids clock 6. the projection feature is a big hit. projects about 4 high numbers on ceiling. 7. projection intensity is good for laying in bed at night without lighting up the whole room 8. decent construction for the $$$ ** cons ** 1. none for my particular application note: if you are looking for a projection clock to use during the day (visible projection in sunlight) you will be extremely disappointed ",positive
" i have had an oregon scientific clock for the last 7 years finally had to replace it because of a soda spill. i knew i wanted another oregon scientific clock and this was the best choice. in fact this one works better then the old one (no long cord with a humongous antenna) i love the time on the ceiling feature. yes it only works when no sunlight is in the room but i dont sleep during the day. i highly recomend this product ",positive
" for around $20. dollars you could save your life and the ones you love. this is super easy to use....both the transmitter & reciever run on batteries so there's no installation. i put mine on my back porch so when i open the door to let my dogs out at night for a quick run nobody will be there to surprise me. people who keep dogs for protection are fooling themselves. but these units are perfect. i've had mine for several days and not once has it gone off for no reason....but it has sounded every time it should have. the range is even better then i expected. only two things i'd change. why the led on the transmitter? i taped a dime over mine so it doesn't show. why alert intruders they're being watched? and it would be nice if the reciever could be plugged into an ac outlet to save on batteries. i have ordered a second one because this little device really gives me peace of mind ",positive
" my husband & i love this unit since we now know when someone is pulling up the driveway. it continues to send us the alert through storms heat and extreme cold. ",positive
" we placed the receiver in our lower deck as we don't have a door bell there...the sensor we placed at the gate at the top of the stairs..when some one opens the gate we can hear it in our spa room .. it works great and gives a sense of privacy. ",positive
" i admit it -- sometimes i just forgot to check to see if the cat wanted back in. the driveway patrol fixed all that. setup about a foot or less off the ground in a relatively sheltered location by the front door it does a great job of watching the front of the driveay and the front door. i originally set the sensor up to look down the entire length of the drive but it proved much too sensitive for this to be useful so i aimed the sensor low across the driveway near the front door and this has worked out fine. it now tells me when the cat is ready to come in as well as when a pizza or package delivery has arrived. the driveway patrol actually saved me quite a bit of trouble one day when i had been waiting the entire afternoon for the cable guy -- he eventually showed up late didn't even bother to knock or ring the bell and only stayed just long enough to leave a note telling me i wasn't home. due to the drveway patrol i managed to wave him down at the end of the drive. this alone made the gadget worth the price. as i've said the driveway patrol does exactly what i need it to do. the only false alarms i get are from visiting neighbor cats racoons and the odd bird. the only things i would change about the gadget would be to add a volume control that had more settings than 'loud' and 'very loud' and the fact that the chimes will ring continuously while being triggered and then for another 10-15 seconds beyond that ",positive
" if you take the time to tune the placement of the sensor this works great! i don't know if the people who complain about these got defective units or have a lot of animals or something setting them off but i have several of these set up to form a perimeter around the house and they work great. we do have cats around here a whole bunch of them but the trick of putting the sensors in a birdhouse worked great and i haven't had any false alarms since doing so. the sensors have been out in the hot florida sun cold nights (well for florida down to about 26) torrential rain and still work great. it didn't take too much time to set them up and test them either. these are definitely a lower-cost way to set up a security system so that you'll know if anyone enters your yard ",positive
" update of my review due to july 2006 heat wave: i have two of these low-cost alarms set up and both become quite intermittent when the temperature reaches 90 degrees and above (in the shade): sometimes they go off when a person/car goes past and sometimes they do not. as soon as the temperature decreases though they become much more reliable. i would not recomended these devices for sections of the country with hot weather such as arizona texas new mexico etc. original review: i am very impressed with this alarm: it is accurately able to detect people coming up the stairs of my apartment and sets off the indoor alarm -- and it has not sent out any false alarms (most problems with this alarm (that i have read in the reviews below) appear to be caused by the sensor being in direct sun light. this seems to cause these units numerous difficulties and should have been addressed in the patrol sensor's enclosed instructions -- but isn't. however by simply shielding the outdoor sensor from all *direct* contact with the light of the sun by using tape or opaque plastic or repositioning the outdoor sensor appears to eliminate false alarms or no alarms). this alarm unit appears to be quite well made and the price is of course incredibly low. great buy!! ",positive
" this grill cover is much nicer than the weber standard cover. i have the 18 1/2 and can't imagine that the 22 1/2 is much different. what i really like is the elastic pieces sown to the bottom that keep it on snuggly even when a little wind is blowing. again it looks nice all black stitching virtually invisible and a nice weber logo. after a couple nights left in the rain the grill shows zero signs of being out in the weather ",positive
" perfect for what it is meant for! what more can i say nice looking and works well ",positive
" well look no further. my apartment complex doesn't allow any type of charcol or gas grills but electric is allowed. i was going crazy trying to find one that would fit my george forman kettle grill - i didn't want to lug it in and out all summer. so i took a gamble and ordered this grill cover and it fits perfectly! i can now leave my george forman kettle grill on my deck and not have to worry about the elements ",positive
" this shelter met all my expectations. i would tell anyone to get the optional sand bags if you do not plan to use spikes to secure it. being so large it catches quite a bit of wind and would surely tip over otherwise. i had mine setup on a raised deck so the sandbags were a life saver! overall this is a high quality item and has already been used a few times and is a much more economical option to renting party tents! the storage bag is outstanding too... with nice wheels and a handle - it is easy to transport! the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is a little challenging to setup because it is so large ",positive
" this is a great little table! i'm able to stand at the table and cut fabric for a sewing project. then adjust the height and the kids can sit at the table and paint or craft. i am very pleased with this purchase! ",positive
" i just received this table and i can already tell that it will be a great asset for my scrapbooking. the table is adjustable in height so no matter where i am scrapbooking i can adjust the height to fit the chair i am sitting in. the table is light enough for me to move by myself and will fold up for easy storage. the table is also sturdy enough to use paper punches and eyelet setters. i'm thinking of purchasing another so i can spread out even more!

" i cannot wait to have a party. i purchased both this and the fire pit table. both pieces are easy to assemble sturdy and really fun! my sister is going to be so jealous. what are sisters for ",positive
" bought this with the sean conway tiverton 2006 deep seating 4-pc. chair set. looks and feels great as a set. it was a chance worth taking.. ",positive
" i agree completely with the other reviewer: well packaged easy to put together very sturdy. way better quality than those you see at outdoor concept stores. i mainly ordered it b/c i knew it would be the right size to go w/the strathwood chaise lounges i ordered; i am very happy with it. ",positive
" the table arrived within a few days and well packed. it was easy to put together took me about 10 minutes. one of the best instructions and labeling of parts i have ever seen even a little bottle with paint for touch ups. the table is just like described and is of good quality. it has a bronze/brown finish and looks great with the strathwood deep-seating chairs i ordered earlier. definetly would buy this again ",positive
" different visually striking very comfortable. the only pedantic problem is that the hinges do seem to rust which may be a problem later on excellent value. go look at crate & barrel for comparison ",positive
" this item arrived 1 week early. i took it out the box and it was already assembled. it is so sleek and extremely comfortable. it is a great addition to my patio. the price was reasonable and it had free shipping. you can't beat it!! i want another one ",positive
" i've had this wireles temperature station for about 2 months now and i'm very happy with it. i mounted the wireless sensor in my outdoor screened porch to both keep it dry and out of the direct sunlight (direct sunlight would likely result in innacurately high readings). the base station is usually in our kitchen but for a while i moved it around different rooms of our house to see how much the indoor temperature varies from room to room - the outdoor sensor never lost contact with the base. the indoor temp reading is accurate and is within 1-2 degrees of 2 thermostats i have in the house and the outdoor temp is accurate with 1-2 degrees of an outdoor mounted thermometer that is also in the screened porch. i enjoy the convenience of quickly and easily knowing what the outdoor temp is in the morning. this product works as advertised and i'm very happy with it. enjoy ",positive
" this is the second temperature station i have purchsed. both work well but differ in small points. the instructions might be clearer. getting back from using max/min iis not easy. i have not used the station in below freezing weather so i am curious to see if the batteries will work at -10 ",positive

" i ordered 3 of these aprons for use on the kcbs bbq circuit and would have preferred a slightly heavier fabric. however for the price these aprons are great. ",positive
" put a few racks or ribs and a full chicken in the smoker on the first use and everything came out great. with the lp gas it was easy to maintain a pretty steady temperature and the large chip box made great smoke for a long period. great barbecue with very little effort ",positive
" there are probably more authentic ways to make real bbq but nothing any easier. if what you like about bbq is the flavor not the work this unit is for you. add water to the pan chips to holder put some dry rubbed pork [...] on one (or all) of the four grates light the gas and you are good to go. it holds temperature very well unattended. adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want. your friends will think you are a genius ",positive
" i love this smoker!!! talk about easy set up and easy to use if you have never had a smoker this is a great buy smoking is so easy and the flavor you get from it is out of this world ",positive
" to keep it from cracking i am using mineral oil on mine and keeping it out of the weather ",positive
" when i decided to purchase a weber kettle i knew that a side table was required. several reviews have spoken about the table splitting. i ordered mine from my local hardware store and when i picked it up i asked about finishing it. the hardware folks (and this is a really good store) gave me a gloss polyurethane finish and very fine sandpaper to prep my work table. bottom line: take some time and finish this product. your local hardware folks will guide you satisfactorily.

" the fabric is very strong and nicer-looking than the usual black covers. very attractive on the deck ",positive
" we had out of town guests arriving when our puppy had chewed our chaise lounge to shreds. we ordered this chaise lounge cushion and it was sent to us immediatly w/o special instructions to do so. when we received it it was a bit thinner than i wanted but for the price and fast delivery it was great!!! the material is durable and of good quality. our kids have been laying on it with swimming pool water dripping off them and it's been out in the weather for 4 weeks and shows no wear. like i said it's a bit thinner than i wanted but a good buy ",positive
" they are handsome and nicer than i expected by far. the fabric has a really nice quality -- strong pleasantly textured durable and a fine rich color. they're handsome well-stitched and sturdy very comfortable and are holding up to the sun -- some rain too i must admit. these were a terrific deal .. ",positive
" i ordered this to go along with the teak lounge chair and both of them turned out to be a great deal. only took one day to arizona and so far no color change from the every day sun ",positive
" nice fabric and construction. backordered item came 3 weeks before expected. fabric color was a little darker than it appeared on the website but that can't always be helped ",positive
" these are very nice quality and comfortable. everything was as expected and came in just a few days ",positive
" cushions look great on chaise loungers bright dark green in color. cushion get very hot in the sun. items arrive well boxed and well before promised date ",positive
" great value... look fantastic on the chairs... excellent price... couldn't be happier ",positive
" nice cushions that dry out pretty fast. seem durable. they also seem high quality. the only thing is they are more of a tan color-- the picture shows them as white which is what i really wanted. but they are nice. could use a strap at the top also so the wind doesn't constantly blow them over ",positive
" i have been using a grill mat for 4 months and i love it. i grill fish and chicken on a broilmaster grill. and i have only great things to say about the mat. i spray a bit of olive oil on after it is warm and then grill my food and it is great!! ",positive
" after reading these other reviews i decided to wait a while to post a review. i bought two of these chairs summer 04 and they are doing great. relatively easy to put together and really sturdy. they are still looking good with no issues with fading or anything. my wife would make me get rid of these if there was any issue or problem with them at all. i hope she doesn't read this ",positive
" they are very attractive and we had no trouble putting them together. our only complaint - the stain ran during a rain storm and stained our patio ",positive
" i bought two of these sets along with the table and wow - i get so many compliments - they are beautiful on my new front porch. i was skeptic at first because of the price but they are worth every penny and a few hundred dollars more. ",positive
" i purchased 2 of these and couldn't be more pleased. like another reviewer i gave 4 stars only becuase i've only had them for a few days and don't know how they'll weather. they arrive mostly assembled and took only about 20 minutes to assemble each set. they look great and are a comfy place to spend an afternoon. not as huge and heavy as the ones we used to make but they're solid and much easier to move ",positive
" i've had these chairs for about a week (i bought two) and they look fabulous on my front porch. they are comfortable too. my expectations were exceeded. like another reviewer i too searched for adirondack chairs and found the prices to be ridiculously high. this chair and ottoman for $84.99 ($10 shipping) is a steal!! the quality and construction seem to far outweigh the price. i only gave 4 stars because i can't comment on the durability and maintenance after only a week. strathwood recommends teak oil a couple of times a year. i also purchased the 30 folding table to place in between the chairs - what a set !!! if you're thinking about this chair don't hesitate you will not be disappointed ! ",positive
" if you are searching for adirondack chairs like i did a few weeks ago you will find a wide array of prices--too ridiculous to mention. this strathwood for 79.99 and 10 for shipping is a steal! i have not been able to find them cheaper anywhere! you get the chair and the foot stool which is why i rated it 4 stars. the quality is decent i think for the price you get what you pay for and a bit more. the kit comes almost constructed--you have do the final screws. the chair comes pre oiled however i highly recommend oiling it again if you want the color to last. i also recommend teaqua do not use conventional teak oil. i do agree with the previous reviewer that if you sit in the chair for an hour it can get uncomfortable however i purchased cushions for it and sitting for an hour has not been a problem. the construciton is sturdy they have been sitting on my deck for about a month now and all is well. mahalo ",positive
" price was right for the grill piece. only drawback is no real grill location to use it ",positive
" on a gusty day when i saw the chessy plastic thermometer i gave my wife for mother's day shattered on the back deck i decided it was about time to replace it with something decent. i did my home work on the internet and found that la crosse made good quality unit at a reasonable price. after opening the box when my ws-8025 arrived and reading over the instructions i had it up and running in under 20 minutes. the ws-8025 allows you to adjust the barometer to local conditions (which you can get on line from your local schools). i've had it up a running for two weeks and find that the ws8025 does a good job of forecasting the weather. the atomic clock took a day to link up (which they tell you in the manual it might) but has stayed linked up since. i purchased the optional tx3up with remote probe that i have in my fish pond. so besides seeing the outside temerature and humidity i can keep an eye on the pond. you can set the ws-8025 to alarm at any high and low temperatures that you chose. (which came in handy the other night when the pond heater failed). so far i'm happy with my purchase and i like the way the lacrosse ws-8025oak looks on the wall. ",positive
" my family and i are quite happy with this hammock. it is comfortable and sturdy. since it doesn't come with the hanging hardware future buyers make sure to order it from amazon at the same time (hammock kit - screws by american science & surplus). otherwise you might find yourself on a long search. the only other place where we came across it was wal mart ",positive
" i ordered this for my dad for christmas. i was worried that it wouldn't fit him because he is a large man but thought what the heck i'll use it if he can't. i opened the box and i wasn't sure it looked like a sack of ropes. then i began unfolding and unfolding and unfolding and before long the thing was stretched at least 14 feet across my kitchen. the loops are just great and seem so strong. the only drawback was its not very soft but i guess it wouldn't be all that sturdy made out of chenille would it. now all i need to do is buy him a home depot giftcard so he can get so sturdy posts and hardware and he is set!! ",positive
" got it and love it. it does not leave marks you when you get up and it is sooooooo comfortable. ",positive
" it was more than i expected. it was easy to hang looks good and most of all it is as comfortable as advertised. too bad i don't have more places to hang more hammocks ",positive
" this clock is great for people who sleep on their backs. if you happen to be lying on your stomach though you have to turn over to see the time on the ceiling or reach over to the clock and press the snooze button to briefly turn on the clock light. i wish the clock itself had a lighted time display. also we have 11 foot ceilings so the display is a little dim. the snooze button is on top. it is big and easy to press but the button to turn the alarm off is small and on the front below the display. you have and grab the clock in an awkward way and hold the button down for a second to turn the alarm off. the clock automatically set the time. i was impressed with this as we live near the bottom of an apartment building surrounded by other tall buildings with no clear view of the sky. ",positive
" this clock is great. i'm always looking over at the clock through the night now i just look up. i recommended this to a friend and she said they love it. this will be christmas presents for everyone next year ",positive
" after much research and reading lots of reviews we chose this weber. it is more expensive than others in its category but the high reviews and our past experience with weber and the warranty helped us make this our choice. we love it so far. we live on top of a hill and one of our concerns was the wind. well the grill performs superbly! even on a cold (40 degrees) and windy day it heated up in less than 10 mintues.

" after extensive research and despite less-than-exptected consumer reports ratings i chose to purchase the 2007 weber summit s-450 grill. i own a 5-year-old charbroil that is bowing out and losing heat/smoke when i cook so i wanted a multi-fuctional grill to replace it that would last longer. the summit s-450 includes a beautiful smoker box with a dedicated burner and a rotisserie kit. more importantly it is a weber which means great warranty and customer service and built to last. when i opened the item with my friends we all salivated at the heavy-duty construction of this grill. the impressive stainless steel was high-grade and the grill was very heavy. no wobbling. it was very easy to set up and took about one hour. let me say that although i expected this grill to be better than my old i never thought it would be so impressive in all aspects. weber thinks about everything when they make a grill. from the heavy gauge stainless steel grates to the high-end burners this grill really catches your eye. having researched the grills at all the local hardware and big box stores i can honestly say this grill beat them all with just looks and materials alone. that was even before i attached the propane and lit the thing! when i did test the burners i was extremely impressed with the ignition system. i've never seen anything like it and all burners including rotisserie and side lit on the first try. the grill got up to heat very quickly and the eveness of the heat was evident buy looks and using a hand test over the grates. while i only cooked a hamburger for my first meal i was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful grill marks the grates left. i do a lot of slow-cooking and smoking and the thermometer smoker box and seal of the grill will certainly improve my grilling of carolina pulled pork and briskett. further the knobs/temperature controls seem to offer infinite heating options. i cannot wait to experiment and learn with this grill as i add items to my menu. while i just got this grill yesterday i am more than hopeful of the quality and craftmanship and truly believe it will last triple the amount of my charbroil. i'll have to add to this review as i continue to use this wonderful grill ",positive
" i got my grill to go advantage just recently and have been very pleased so far. the makers of the grill 2 go appear to have heard some of the criticisms of earlier models and taken that into consideration with this grill. the open flame cooking is preferable to the previous models it is still easy to transport and it has made tailgating with friends before watching my tarheels play basketball a lot of fun. i completely disagree with the other reviewer who seems to be reviewing the wrong product since this grill does not use a non-stick cooking surface for the cooking area ",positive
" great little digital thermomter as long as you keep it out of direct sunlight. i have it in the back of the house pointing west and it only gets minimal sun. i have checked it against various banks in town and it is very accurate. was just what i wanted and for the price it works great ",positive
" we stuck this outside our bedroom window - now we can see what the temperature is outside as soon as we get up in the morning. no more waiting for the weather to come on the news to figure out what to wear! ",positive
" another gadget i had to have. for the price this is a really neat outdoor thermometer that shows the high and low temperature of the day. one important note is the location of installation. i live in s.fla and mounted it on the north facing window. you must locate it in a spot where direct or even somewhat direct sunlight does not affect it as this will most likely give false readings. if you have a glass door or window that leads to a screen enclosure this would also allow for a fairly correct temperature reading although this could also cause improper readings in the heat of the day as the metal pan roof can reflect heat to the inside of the screen enclosure. all in all i love mine and reccomend it. i bought 10 of them at christmas and gave them out as gifts ",positive

" finally - a grill cover that actually stays on the grill and protects it in the worst weather. the velcro straps keep it secure but it is very easy to remove when ready to use the grill. this has to be the 4th or 5th grill cover we've tried and it will be the last one we try. i would recommend this product to anyone investing iin a grill. why not spend a couple bucks more so that your $400 grill doesn't rust out in two seasons ",positive
" this is a quality heavy duty grill cover. when you pay good money for a weber grill you want it to stay looking good. don't go buy one of those cheap walmart covers for $10. it will not last and you will end up buying another one in a year or two. this cover wasnt cheap but by the looks of it...it should last a long time ",positive
" eating the chicken that this roaster produced was almost a spiritual experience! i had it for a month or so before i remembered to buy a whole bird and defrost it to use. then i realized i didn't really have any beer on hand or anything but the chicken had to be cooked so i used what i had. i'm hear to tell you that putting a little jack daniels in the well (i don't drink it i only cook with it) along with a little water and some tequila lime vinegar and then sprinkling the bird with cajun seasoning still produced an amazingly moist and flavorful chicken. i was astounded - it took about an hour to cook and the bird was juicy tender and flavorful with a nice crispy skin. do not walk run to buy this thing. it's worth every penny and you're not getting weird chemicals from an actual beer can (with it's label etc) in your chicken and as i just proved the sky is the limit as to what you put in the resevoir. yum!! ",positive
" i bought two of these weber roasters because they make the process of roasting chicken so easy. no can and a nonstick surface make removing the cooked chicken so much easier and clean up is a cinch. also because these roasters retain the juices in the pan the inside of my bbq is much cleaner and i don't have to clean it after every chicken i cook ",positive
" man what a awesome weber item.. it cooked the chicken so well and for clean up was a charm. i think im planning to buy another to cook two birds at once. ",positive
" this item is great. it keeps my chicken upright there is no beer can to dispose of after the chicken is cooked no grease gets in my grill it holds the chicken while i carve it and it cleans up super easy. i have recommended this product to friends and family ",positive
" we already had 2. this was a gift for my father. easy to make easy to clean does not make a mess on the bbq like other poultry roasters. the pan underneath catches all of the drippings. the secret cap keeps all of the moisture in. the only way for the liquid to escape is through the chicken. therefore very moist ",positive
" my family and i love beer can chicken but i didn't like the idea of literally putting my food onto a beer can. this weber poultry roaster is so much cleaner and far easier than using a beer can. the chicken remains stable too...no more trying to balance the chicken on a beer can. and it's a great way to switch from using beer to using wine. what a fabulous product ",positive
" very easy to use. simply fill the aluminum cup in the tray with beer wine fruit juice or some other beverage. for extra flavor add spice as well. place the infusion cone on top of the cup then place the chicken on top of the infusion cone. once the chicken is in place put the infusion cap on top to lock in the steam. steam cooks the chicken on the inside heat on the outside. chicken is tender and juicy on the inside while the skin is cooked to a golden crispy brown. fat and grease drain away from the chicken and collect in the bottom of the roaster instead of the grill. to remove cooked chicken from roaster: remove the infusion cap. next take a pair of tongs and go down the back side of the chicken and slide it off the infusion cone. this is easy to do since the roaster is nonstick. if your chicken is heavy you may need to support it with a second set of tongs ",positive
" if you've ever made beer can chicken then you know what a problem it is sometimes to get the chicken to sit properly on the grill with only a beer can for support. the weber poultry roaster solves this problem and goes several steps further to result in a moist tender and absolutely delicious chicken. this item gets 5 stars and two thumbs up!! the pan has a well in the center to hold the beer. this by the way uses less liquid than traditional beer can chicken which leaves more of the golden nector for other purposes such as drinking for those who prefer to do so. the medieval torture looking prong device sits over the beer well and the chicken in turn sits on this. weber includes a round cap that fits on the top of the chicken to help seal in the moisturizing juices. the pan then sits in the grill and collects the chicken drippings thus keeping the grill cleaner. the chicken sits very securely in this pan with no chance of opening the grill to find it had fallen over. the non-stick coated surfaces make this roaster pretty easy to clean up especially for something that's been sitting in the grill for an hour or so. we've used this roaster several times and are still just as thrilled with it as we were on day 1. the chicken always comes out so moist tender and flavorful it's hard to believe it was grilled! i highly recommend this roaster in fact i've even given them as gifts.

" for reference old tanks will refer in this review to weber quick connect tanks. first about the price: i got this at home depot for $16.95 because i needed to grill in a hurry. if you do not have an opd tank for your weber grill and can see yourself in the future refilling and you would receive it in time before you run out then i would recommend getting it on amazon for the lesser price but can afford shipping time. if you have an older weber grill and wanted the tank to be refilled then you probably understand the frustration that i had to go through to get more propane. federal law has mandated that all tanks now be opd certified. now on these opd tanks which can be detected by the star shape of the handle has a different opening where the hose on your grill needs to be connected as compared to the older model. so when i went to have it refilled they told me that they could no longer refill my old model. so i bought a blue rhino. then i could not connect it to my weber grill because of the different opening. (the propane hose would not adapt to the tank.) so i now had three options. one was buy a new grill which would be quite expensive. second which weber recommended probably because it would cost me more money would be buying a new hose. (they said it was around $40. and i have also heard that it has a problem with squirrels eating it.) and third was this adapter that i found. thus this adapter was the answer for the price. connect the thread side of the adapter and your hose to the other side of the adapter (this is the spring side or quick connect side where to release the hose from the adapter you must just pull back on the end part of the adapter.) a picture of the adapter with the the new tank and old hose can be found here: http://www.homedepot.com/cmc_upload/hdus/en_us/asset/images/eplus/161203_3.jpg i also have some advice on using the product to which i hope you may find useful. (the installation instructions were quite weak with the product.) when installing there is a black plastic piece which is used to screw in the adapter to the part. be careful when using your crescent wrench not to break off the part. if you break the plastic piece you probably will be unable to take off the adapter from the tank in the future. therefore i would also recommend placing the piece in a safe place so when you need to refill it will be handy to take off the adapter. however if you lose the piece or break it there is one more way to have it refilled. there is an adapter which was placed on the old tanks for refilling. and since this product basically converts your new tank into the old one then you can place this refilling adapter on the product. i know it can be confusing in words but basically what i am saying is that you will have adapter on adapter when refilling the tank. your refill store will most likely have this second adapter for you when you go in to refill. (i get mine a pool-mart and they usually have this handy.) but just to be on the safe side i would keep that plastic piece. but back to installation: when you finished screwing it in just connect your hose to the other side by pulling back on the only part of the adapter that moves and once you push the hose end into the adapter push back up the only part of the adapter that moves to lock the hose in place. and to remove the hose simply pull back on the sliding adapter piece - the only part that moves. but most likely you didn't need that as you have refilled your old grill sometime in the last several years. but just in case you may have needed it. and on performance there are no leaks as shown with the soap and water test. just pure gas grilling is all i have now until another law is passed. but until then i recommend two things: first is buying this adapter and second is using common sense to install it not the instructions. happy grilling and thanks for reading ",positive
" using this procuct makes changing propane tanks a really quick procedure. just remember to pull the outer ring back before installing the male part. additional items need to be offered if you are not just ordering an extra one for your weber grill. 1) an adapter for the propane retailer to fill your tank. 2) the male portion of this quick connect adapter so that other propane appliances can be attached to your tank. it doesn't look like it is included as offered. the quick connect adapter by itself won't do you any good ",positive

" i got this last year from amazon.com during one of their bundle specials with the hammock stand. it's a nice hammock and comfortable for the most part. my only complaint is that the ropes are too elastic. while it's very relaxing and conforms to your body after about 30 minutes of laying or sitting on it you have to get up and retension the hammock to keep your body from dragging along the ground (i'm a lightweight at about 135 lbs). it's possible that i need to break it in more since i've only used it about 10 times but right now it kind of annoying that i can't just relax without worrying about feeling the ground beneath me ",positive

" i did a lot of searching and review reading on the internet before finally deciding what to buy. i am convinced quick draw ii is the best value available of any make by any conpany. the features on the qdii are generally found only on much higher priced detectors. this thing really works as advertised. i have already found several coins and other things right in my own yard. it will reliably indicate what coin is being detected although it many times confuses dimes and pennies on the lcd readout. it is very sensitive and detects most coin size items very reliably to about 6 or 8 inches. the auto notch discrimination works well and filters out most trash items. i have used metal detectors that ended up being aggravating and frustrating. this one is a pleasure to use and is quickly becoming a relaxing and profitable pastime for me. if you want a serious metal detector without spending a whole lot of money give it a try... you won't be disappointed..

" our old general electric indoor/outdoor thermometer's outdoor sensor broke this summer so it was time to replace it with a weather station that could give more info about the weather than just the temp. i live in south florida and it's nice to know what the heat index is because in the summer our temps along the coast rarely rise above 90 degrees but the heat index rarely is below 100 (in which case i choose the indoor treadmill over running outside). i bought this unit on the strength of prior reviews which i think are pretty darn accurate in their overall assessment. i can't present much new information here but i will validate some of the prior comments. the weather station is constructed of cheap plastic. i think if this station falls off our kitchen bar where it rests today it will break into smithereens. it'll be best hung from a nail on a wall or put in a location where it's not going to fall to the ground -- ever. the weather station has a clumsy vertical design with a small base so i think it'd be pretty easy to bump into it and knock it over. the same advice in the above paragraph applies here too. the weather station does emit a high-pitched tone when you press a button to backlight the display for a few seconds. it's not a big deal to me but some might find that annoying. the weather station does have a clutzy non-intuitive method of setting the display which really does call for pressing the set button up to 11 times! each depression of the set button selects one area of the display to be set and there are a lot of settings being displayed (time day date etc.). it was pretty easy to spend a moment setting the weather station (despite the clutzy interface) and because i live in the eastern time zone my job was made easier because the default setting is for the eastern time zone. the clock automatically synchronized with some atomic clock somewhere so that part worked just fine. as for accuracy well i've had it only a few days now but it seems to be working alright. we've had rain for the last few days and the barometric display -- which only shows clouds/rain partly sunny and sunny -- accurately forecasted the cold front by the drop in air pressure. when i put the outdoor sensor next to the indoor sensor (inside my house) the readings were within a few tenths of a degree from each other. the humidity readings were exactly the same. the weather station reads between .3 and .7 degrees warmer than my old indoor/outdoor thermometer. i wouldn't know which of the two digital displays is accurate -- my old thermometer or this new weather station. the weather station does seem a lot more jumpy when it comes to reading the indoor temp. it's quick (when compared to my old indoor thermometer) to change the reading when say the air conditioning turns on. having the lunar phase display is a nice touch. overall i like this unit so far. i wish it were constructed of more durable plastic -- my old ge indoor/outdoor unit is built to be thrown against a wall without being damaged -- and i think i'd prefer a thermometer reading that wasn't quick so jumpy with temperature fluctuations. i like the humidity readings for both indoor and outdoor and i especially like the heat index calculation. in all i would recommmend this weather station to other buyers ",positive
" i'm very happy with this product. setup was straightforward and the sensor measurements seem to be consistently accurate. i think it was a good value. i particularly like the outdoor humidity and dew point lcd displays on the body of the outside module in addition to the remote display of the information indoors. it is also handy that the remote display shows local time referenced to nist's wwv ",positive

" this is my first charcoal grill and i will say i bought it because of weber's reputation for so many years as the best charcoal grill. as mentioned it isn't very big for indirect cooking. i cook for just my wife and me and it's fine but too small for cooking for guests. if i could do it over again i'd buy the 22 1/2 grill because of it's larger cooking area and ability to add the rotisserie attachment. i'm not a big rotisserie guy but the extention is needed to cook beer can chicken something i have always loved to cook on gas grills.

" you can't go wrong here took just 20 minutes and i have 10 thumbs all you need is a hammer and look at the pictures that come in the book. for taste you can't tell that even i who can and does burn water can cook mouth watering burgers and steaks that my family duplicates in their high priced propane lugging grills. same recipe-charcoal and light it without the propane burn. one just need to be very generous with the non-stick spray or else your food sticks and breaks up on the grill. also the kingford fast start charcoal is a marvel if you cook just several burgers and a steak because after about 20 minutes the charcoal burns out. lastly the bottom vent is quite cheesy so for the grilling i did not open it and grilled with the top off with no fear of hot ashes whipping around the yard ",positive

" my husband and i had been talking about getting a detector on and off for over a year. the more we looked into it the more confused we were. we didn't know what features we needed or what to look for. we didn't want to spend too much but were afraid to go too low and end up with one that didn't work well. we decided on this one based on other reviews and price. it came with a video which helped us understand about the model and how they work in general. just practicing around the yard he found two colonial coins. we've only taken it on one camping trip and found a silver dime some quarters pennies and a silver mexican peso in new hampshire about 4 inches deep. my husband is getting the hang of it. the more items you find the more you understand it. he says that when it says it's junk turns out it is junk and it's been right on with quarters and smaller coins. we are very happy with the unit and feel we made the right choice. i would have given it one more star but my husband hasn't found any jewelry yet ",positive
" i've owned the bounty hunter land star for about 2 years now and it is a great economically priced detector. shop around because you can get it for less then one hundred dollars if you know where to look... cough... ebay... cough... ebay. i've found tons of silver coins with this detector. it's target processor is extremely reliable for coins. if you get a solid repeatable coin tone then you've got a 95% chance of digging up a coin. i've also found civil war buttons old toys and multiple rings at the beach. yesterday i found 2 mercury head dimes (1918 and 1941) in a local park. believe me when i tell you that treasure is in the ground everywhere. contrary to another review that you may see below the all-metal mode works exactly as it should. not only does it work as it should but it is the most useful and descriptive mode on this machine. mr. david carlson obviously doesn't know how to operate his metal detector. the symptoms that he describes are the result of someone not reading the manual. he doesn't understand the relationship between all-metal mode and ground balance. it just takes a moment to read and understand. bottom line: great metal detector to get you into the hobby cheaply so that you can begin finding some great stuff. like i said i've been using mine for 2 years and i don't feel the need to upgrade ",positive

" i used my last little smokey at least 3 days a week 6 mounths of the year here in mn for 18 years. i am only cooking for two so it works out perfect because you get the preformance of a webber but you use verry little charcoal. don't forget to shut the vents when you are done cooking this smuthers the coals then you can just add about half as much as you would otherwise need next time. getting a chimney gets your charcoal ready with only newsprint as your starting aid in about 10 minutes. as far as preformance goes you can't beat a webber you can grill (no lid extreamly hot) or you can smoke or bake with the lid on. read the cook book that comes with your grill and you will be an expert in no time. the only negative is they replaced the wooden handle with plastic.

" i was really hoping for a larger grill but i should have read the measurements! after reading the directions you have to put a foil drip pan in the bottom and surround this with your coals...then if you are cooking something that needs a longer cooking time you have to keep adding coals..i don't get how you would do this if you have a grill full of hot food..seems a little inconvenient to me. it will be okay for a few burgers and dogs but i think i'll invest in a larger grill next time ",positive

" bought it and deep fried a turkey very juicy even after rewarming in the microwave the next day. i did end up ripping the hose out of the end of this thing though i pulled it gently when moving it and it came right out oops ",positive
" i have long been skeptical of deep frying at home. the smell the mess the smell...anyway i recently decided to throw a fish fry and decided it was time to invest in a fryer. the biggest issue for me in purchasing a fryer was the sturdiness of the burner stand. besides having the ability to heat 12 quarts of oil i also wanted a burner stand that would hold the weight of 20 quarts of beer for my homebrewing. i decided on the bayou classic. this bayou classic kit came with everything and setup was simple. the burner stand exceeded my expectations for sturdiness and the height was such that when using the 10 quart stock pot you could place the burner stand on a safe sturdy work surface to elevate it off the ground. i plan on also using this burner with my wok. the burner was able to bring the oil to temperature in approximately 15 minutes. the fish and chips turned out great. of course when using 350 degree boiling oil you do not want your weekend fry festival to end with either a trip to your local burn unit or a reason to see if allstate really has you in good hands. common sense must prevail and last time i checked amazon does not sell that yet. set your fry area up away from kids pets and anything that you want to see another day. if you follow that simple advice all should turn out okay. clean up can be best described as sticky but in order to get the life out of your aluminum parts don't skimp. now that i have tackled fish and chips i will have to move on to the other must have fried foods these days: turkeys chickens and twinkies. i can't wait.

" i am now on my second round of herb kits and for this batch i purchased three kits and mixed the pods to make my fall/winter mix: cilantro basil parsely thyme savory sage and oregano. the basil thyme savory and oregano are from the new italian herb kit. everything i've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time. the savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since i started. the basil is the first to sprout. the parsely seems to be slow but steady. your herbs will be good for at least six months. with proper care i'm sure you could extend their life. these are very easy to care for and it's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal. i recommed this product to anyone who loves fresh herbs and/or anyone who has had problems growing herbs in the past ",positive

" i didn't know much about grills so i asked around. everyone told me to get a weber grill and after reading reviews i could see why. i just got my grill this weekend and we have used it 3 times already..we love it! very sturdy/solid and super easy to use. all you need to do is turn the gas on turn a knob..and press the ignitor! everything we have cooked has come out perfectly very even cooking. this grill may not have all the bells and whistles but you can bet it will last for years to come. ",positive
" just got this grill yesterday from a competitors website. i got super lucky as they had it priced the same as the e-210 by mistake. so i was able to purchase it for 299.99 and they offered free shipping! low and behold they honored the price. they did change the price back to 399.99 the next day...anyhow it came in a huge box thank god the deliver man was nice enough to bring it in my condo. instructions say 30 minutes to put together for the average consumer but i would say at least 45 minutes to 1 hour. plus you do need a second person for 1 step. after assembling we fired it up and instant ultra hot heat!! this thing gets burning hot fast. we did some shortribs and salmon. they both did stick pretty good to the grates which was annoying but i assume since it's new it will take a few times of cooking before the stickiness goes away. plus the only reason why i was forced into a gas grill was because my condo association did not allow me to use my weber charcoal performer(great grill) by the way!! i am now actually happy they did force me to lose the charcoal because this grill definitely outweighs charcoal for convenience hands down. i used to occasionally burn food on my performer....but i don't see that ever happening with this although i got a screaming deal i would recommend this over the e-210 simply because the 3 burners a must have for rotisserie and indirect cooking!!! i can't wait to buy a rotisserie unit summer will be sweet!

" this product is great. in the beginning when i received it i didn't use it often. and was skeptical about it. one thing you have to practice how to use it rihgt. it looks kina simple but and with this fork you have to know how to catch perfect temperature. it work flawless no disappointments. recommend try it ",positive

" don't hesitate to buy this grill!!!! for the past few years i've been switching back and forth between my gas grill and my good ole weber kettle grill. like everyone else i prefer grilling over charcoal so this seemed like the perfect grill for me... i was right! this grill takes all the pain away from grilling with charcoal. one push of a button and 15 minutes later i am grilling ribeyes. yes! it is that simple. the chimney revolutionized how i grilled with charcoal but this is 10 times better than that. the propane ignition rocks the work area is great the lid holder is a nice addition and the water proof charcoal holder is more convenient than i thought it would be. let us not forget it has a dual purpose thermometer! it took me about 40 minutes to assemble but that's to be expected. oh yeah i ordered it on monday and it was delivered on thursday. ",positive
" i have hosted three cookouts with my new weber grill and have yet to find anything i don't like about it. i am so glad that i spent the little extra. i had purchased a gas grill 5 years ago thinking that i needed to go in that direction; fact is i used it less and was pretty unhappy. going back to charcoal is easy to explain; however explaining why this grill is so great is very hard. i guess you would just have to sample my cooking:) ",positive
" i bought this grill for my husband. even though we already had a weber i thought he might appreciate the added features this one offers. i was right. he raves about it every time he uses it! ",positive
" i just love this grill. i previously had a regular weber kettle charcoal grill but when my son took it to college i had the perfect excuse to upgrade. the grill is large enough to grill meat and veggies for a family of 4 to 6. the cooking grate has hinged sides. this allows you to easily add more coals every hour or so for extended indirect grilling cooking. you won't believe how handy the very large and stable table is; it is very durable and cleans up nicely. store your large bag of charcoal in the rain protected bin then just pull out the bag to pour charcoal right into the 2 charcoal holders. the charcoal holders keep the coals gathered together to light well and eliminate the need for a charcoal chimney. you only need to run the propane burner for 5 minutes to get the coals started so one canister lasts quite long. (i always set a timer so i don't forget to turn it off.) the charcoal holders are perfect for indirect grilling just push them to the sides of the kettle when the coals are ready. if direct grilling you can still use the charcoal holders to heat the coals then use tongs to dump the coals onto the bottom grate when they are ready. very convenient. the bottom wire shelf makes a perfect spot to set the hot charcoal holders after you dump the coals into the grill. the stainless steel ash catcher works very well. (the non-stainless ash catcher on my regular kettle grill didn't work as smoothly and used to catch and jam sometimes.) the lid holder is really great. just pick up the lid and slide it to the left and it is held in place for you. no more trying to hang the lid from the little lid hook. the thermometer is very handy to monitor temperature for longer cooking items. if you are bbqing ribs or a roast keeping the temperature regulated low is important. all these little conveniences simply add up to a nice cooking experience. i enjoy my gas grill too but it takes a little more skill to cook over charcoal. i have a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction when i serve up a perfectly cooked meal from my beautiful weber performer grill. find a spot to show it off - this beauty really looks great in the yard ",positive
" we bought our performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store. it was the best purchase we ever made! its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition....about 15-20 minutes you're ready to grill. for the people who own a gas grill and are considering the performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal...its a piece of cake (we had our reservations too!) and you're going to wish you switched sooner. food never tasted so good ",positive
" i saw a review on this grill regarding the cover already...i just wanted to reiterate that the cover listed with this grill is incorrect. the cover numbered '9911' is not the cover for the one touch performer. you need the order the cover numbered '9986' to get the proper cover for this grill. i confirmed this with weber. if you ever have issues with your grill...do not hesitated to call or email weber...their customer svc. is out of this world. otherwise this is a fantastic grill. i grew up eating off webers and i own an old school 18 kettle that i have had for as long as i can remember....a weber smokey mountain cooker (a must have) and now this performer. although given to me as a gift worth every penny. ",positive
" i love this thing. it is of course basically a weber kettle which is all you need. the tweaks are terrific though. the gas starter works like a charm. i'd thought that moving from lighter fluid to a chimney made getting the grill going almost as clean and predictable as turning on your kitchen oven but this is even better. the work surface is really handy the kettle top holder is dirt-simple but works just fine the charcoal trays for indirect cooking are nice and the charcoal storage is handy (but more about this in a minute). the built-in thermometer is really an asset. it's an ordinary meat thermometer that can sit at the top of the kettle or be removed to use on food. it's very helpful when slow-cooking using the kettle top to know what the temperature is (and fun beside to see the grill breathe as the coals burn down or you add more or the vents get adjusted or whatever). then when you're about done you can pull it out and check the meat. simple but great. all the little things add up to make this a cut above. a few things. the instructions that come with the grill can be read to mean that it's necessary to use the charcoal trays with the gas starter. you don't; either a chimney or just a pile of charcoal work perfectly well. turning the gas knob just enough to get a flame and running the starter for short times will extend the tank's life; three minutes or so seems to be plenty to get the fire started. and look for a scoop or something similar to use with the charcoal holder or plan on getting your hands dirty moving charcoal. overall though this is a great setup. i did a hickory-smoked leg of lamb last night that was to die for and about two-and-a-quarter hours from pressing the starter button to on the table. fabulous. ",positive
" i've had this grill for one summer now and cannot say enough good things about it. ours was recently blown off the patio by a particularly nasty windstorm and survived without hardly a scratch. for those concerned about the price: when you look at all the extra features - not just the ignition system but the work table the charcoal bin and the tool rack - it really is worth every penny. plus consider for this price what sort of gas grill could you get ",positive
" i bought the performer from amazon about 9 months ago now and never got around to reviewing it. yesterday as i was cooking some pork chops on it i made a mental note to come here to review. personally i believe it is the best charcoal grill for most people. like others have said it is so easy to get the charcoal started without using lighter *gag* fluid. yes you could use a chimney to accomplish this in about the same time and i have used a chimney for years. but with a small child dog and dry conditions here in dallas the performer's solution is so much safer. the performer cooks as well as any weber kettle which is fantastic. the work area is nice and the holder for charcoal is very clever. i really can't imagine a better charcoal grill for the non fanatic. i did have a missing part with my grill when i received it. however one call to weber had the part to me in days. it was a wheel so it wasn't a big deal -- i could assemble everything else. final disclosure -- i am a pretty big fan of weber products. when i bought this i had three other weber grills. i found that the performer replaced both old standard kettle and my genesis gas grill. the performer is ready so quick that i just never used the gas grill any more. gave it to a friend and have no regrets.

" this is truely a must have. the flat non-stick skewers holds everything in place they won't flop around so the unbalanced pieces of food are always on the bottom near the heat. a friend told me about these at gander mountain selling for $7.39 a set but i checked here 1st and found them for $5.99 a set. i ordered 5 sets!! the skewers are 14 long for plenty of food. get yours today don't wait. get at least 2 sets.

" i've used ez up tents for years at trade shows and other venues. since i saw a review here that said it was used as a shelter for 8 months and then it failed i thought i'd point out that these are not permanent shelters. i had one fail due to rain damage once. left it outside after our wedding (it covered the caterer table) and we had a torrential downpour. the canopy filled with rain the weight broke the support. it was a tremendous amount of water the equivalent of a person sitting on a single crossbar. the reason ez up likely told the person they don't cover wind and rain damage is because in eight months the thing had to have been rained on and blown at. if you're looking for a fast to assemble cover for trade shows street fairs etc. ez up's great.

" i love my brinkman's smoker. but i did some modifications to get it in its present state: the offset firebox arrangement: using plain old charcoal will cost you a fortune! when i first got this as a christmas present i found this out quick! i went thru a whole 20 pound bag of kingsford. too costly! so what i did was to buy a propane tank and a propane burner. i ran the burner's metal intake connector out the brinkman's air intake vent. perfect fit! the vent also held up one end of the propane burner. then i placed a regular brick inside the firebox to support the other side of the propane burner. i now have all the heat i want cheaply and also i now have pretty good temperature control! i also agree with another poster that the optional temperature gauge placed in the brinkman's cutout is a waste of money and would be inaccurate. i did it and regret buying that thing. however do get a remote smoker temperature unit that gives you two separate temperature probes and readings. this way you can monitor both meat and internal smoker temps without opening the huge smoking chamber lid which would waste all your heat and smoke! and speaking of smoke... ...it drove me crazy figuring out how to make a sustained source of smoke that wouldn't snuff out the propane burner in the process! here is what i did to solve this new problem: take off that hobbit external smoke stack. then take off the flimsy end cap that holds the swivel lid of the exhaust vent. with a drill carefully make an 1/8 inch hole thru the welded on rod the end cap was attached to. replace the lid. now take a tie-wire or maybe a cotter pin and put that into the hole you just made so that the swivel lid won't fall off as you invert it.... ...invert it??? yes invert it. see you will be stuffing hickory wood blocks into this inverted pipe. the part with the swivel lid will be placed directly onto the propane burner. the end of the smoke stack should be positioned into the smoking chamber. this way as smoke is produced the smoke will go directly into the chamber not the fire box which if it did would snuff out the propane burner! and speaking of hickory smoke... ...don't buy chips! it is too costly! buy instead hickory wood blocks. i buy mines from home depot in large bags for super cheap! i use my small axe to carefully size the hickory blocks so that it fits snuggly into the inverted smoke stack. works like magic. oh one more thing... ...place another hickory wood block you carefully sized into the now stubby smoking chamber's exhaust pipe where the smoke stack used to attach to. the wood block will block just enough so that most of the smoke stays inside the chamber and the wood block will allow just enough air flow so that the offset firebox's propane burner will get its air. there you have it. the perfect smoker that is cheap to operate and effective at generating smoke! and don't forget to place a metal pot ontop of the propane burner that is full of water. you need this boiling to create the needed steam for your smoker's performance ",positive
" i have to agree with the previous reviewer who noted the temperature discrepancy. items placed closer to the firebox do get much hotter than those on the smokestack end. this is probably my only complaint about this smoker. this problem can be moderated somewhat. you can create a makeshift baffle from aluminum flashing that will help some. you can also put an aluminum drip pan full of water directly in front of the opening which will not only deflect some of the heat but introduce some humidity into the cooking section. personally i just don't fill it up with meat. if you're doing several slabs of ribs use a rib rack at the far end. airflow and temperature control were problems for me at first. my particular smoker works best with the air intake vent completely closed. this is not an air-tight smoker so it's still drawing air through the cracks in the door. by keeping the fire low and the vent closed the temperature doesn't climb over 250 degrees. concerning the temperature--forget putting a thermometer in the space provided by brinkmann. it's too high on the lid and it will read quite a bit higher than the food at grate level. heat rises you know. i drilled a hole just above the handle and mounted a thermometer. when i cook with the grates at the upper level this thermometer reads just about right for the level of the food. when i cook on the lower level the actual temperature will be 30-50 degrees lower than what this thermometer reads. it's not totally precise but hey it's barbeque!!! i've had this smoker for about 3-4 years. i keep it under a covered area so it doesn't get rained on but the humidity in my area is always high. i've had to repaint it once. the firebox needs repainting now but that's been the only maintenance i've done to it. i just clean out the ashes and the food drippings after each use and roll it under the covering until the next time. before each use i line the firebox and the cooking section with heavy duty aluminum foil. that makes clean-up a lot easier. (what did we do before reynolds?) i don't smoke a lot with the brinkmann. mostly i use a weber kettle grill. but every time i do a brisket or big roast or several slabs of ribs i crank this baby up and it's never failed me yet. keep the temperature low keep an eye on the fire and don't open the cooking section very often. just let nature low heat and smoke do their job.

" i got my pit back in '92 and i have not been kind to this unit at all but it has never let me down. i am finally ready for a new one and will purchase the snp once again only this tme i will get the cover to keep the louisiana rain away from it. i bbq year round and love the results i get with my pit.heat control seem simple for me i leave the smoke stack open full and the air vent open only a sliver and the heat stays around 200-220. i would say invest in a charcoal starter for adding coals and wood in the middle of a bbq session that way you do not get lighter fluid taste on you meat the person trying to do steaks and pork chops i sugest ya grill those in the fire boxand bbq your larger cuts of meat. all and all this was a great purchase and you will not be sad ya spent the bucks for this one :o) ",positive
" i have had this smoker for about 8 years. as i live on the east coast of florida it has been subjected to a great many adverse conditions. sun rain heat salt air and the occasional 150+ mph sandblasting. the only degradation that it has experienced was that the 2 legs (without the wheels) need replacing due to rusting off at the bottom and the grills had to be replaced. maintenance is a snap just regular cleaning and an occasional coat of oven black. she may not be the youngest lady at the ball but she still makes the best ribs chicken and steak ",positive
" i have had mine for 4 years and it has worked out great. the main difference between this offset barbecue and more expensive ones is the lack of complete air control. there are simply too many open seams to allow in air. so... it takes a bit of tending to keep the temperature at 215f. that said with a bit of patience and practice you can make excellent barbecue on this thing. the metal gauge is heavy enough to last you several years (though eventually the firebox will burn out) ",positive
" this unit is easy to load easy to maintain temperature and simply cooks the best barbeque. i have not seen any other wood or charcoal smoker that can compare dollar for dollar. you have complete control over how smokey the flavor is (or isn't). i only check the temp once every hour. i have done 5 full racks of ribs (on a ribrack) not &quot;babybacks&quot; either plus 2 pork shoulders at once and could have fit more! use all charcoal all wood or any combination. i also use charwood because it burns so clean. i recommend ordering the optional thermometer which fits in the built-in opening in the right hand side of the big door. holds up to 100 lbs of meat! has a drippings drain on the lower right. firebox is easy to clean i use a garden trowel. tomorrow i'm doing 2 racks of ribs 10 lbs. of chicken wings and corn on the cob... i love it!!!!

" i've had this grill for almost a year now and have had no reliability problems with it. i purchased mine a lowe's. the grill has very good flame/temperature control and the side burner is excellent. i grill on it seven days a week through the summer months and on warm weekends in the fall. the heat is pretty even inside there really isn't any major hot/cold spots. the side burner is nice since it comes with a non stick coated griddle for cooking. i actually used this feature late fall during a power outage to cook eggs and french toast for breakfast. the side burner without the griddle has a cast iron pot holder. the lid on the side burner is large enough you can close it when using smaller pots. very useful on windy or chilly days. overall i am extremely pleased with this grill and i have had no rust or wearing issues with it. the only drawback to the grill's design is the ignitor only works on the far left burner. it lights the 3 burners from left to right. so if your only using 1 burner for a quick meal like hot dogs or hamburgers for 2 people you need to always use the left burner ",positive
" i bought this grill locally after researching many others. i originally did not want a side burner but have been very happy with it. it works great for cooking vegetables in a pan and is superb with the griddle for cooking breakfast. i can cook an entire dinner or breakfast without using the stove. i do agree that it did take a long time to assemble (about 2 hrs.) but is solid and works beautifully. i would highly recommend this grill for the money it is a great deal ",positive

" the ws-9119u weather station monitors outside temp and humidity and inside temp and humidity. further it monitors barometric pressure and make a gross prediction of weather change via pictoral representations of weather. for the price it serves a function but it's not an all encompasing scientific weather station..... most of which cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars. this unit is good to observe outside weather conditions monitor inside conditions and monitor gross weather change.... for this it a a reliable and relatively inexpensive instrument ",positive
" i've had this weather station for about a month now. it seems to get accurate readings - only if you can find a good spot for your remote sensor. a bit of sunshine will make your readings higher than normal (outside). a couple complaints: as one reviewer said the buttons make the unit feel cheap they feel clunky. but i only used them to get it all setup so its no big deal. i've had some mixed results from the barometer. when the actual pressure is mid-range its right on (i've chcked some readings from local airports to see how acurate it is). but when a low or high pressure system moves in the readings are off more than i'd expect. however the important thing is that you can see the pressure changing in the right direction. lastly the forecasting model it uses hasn't worked for me...yet. i live west of denver close to the mountains. this probably creates a local weather pattern that the unit cannot predict. i did not expect it to but we've had some rain snow and fog that the unit claims it can observe and did not. it's only been a month so i expect to see a prediction that is accurate at some time. overall i am happy with this product and think it is worth the money. there were many other models i looked at and i think this gives the the most for the money ",positive
" set up was easy. just read the manual and follow the instructions. don't take short cuts. forcasting is excellent after setting the barometer to match local conditions. we live over 1000 feet above sea level. adjusting for that was needed. weather.com's zip code oriented barometric pressure info made that relatively easy. the screen is easy to read and understand. the main unit has a solid feel and does not look cheap. the external humidity and temperature sensor fits easily between a closed window and it's screen. the manual could be more complete. it wasn't clear that the icon that depicts a connection with the national time service doesn't appear until after the first connection is made in the wee hours of the morning. when you manually set the clock make sure you do it in 24 hour mode. then switch to 12 hour mode if that is what you want displayed. again the manual should have pointed that out ",positive
" some of the reviews of this weather station looked pretty poor but i took a chance and bought it anyway. overall i am very pleased and glad that i didn't take the reviews too seriously. i found that the temperature accuracy seems to be fine; i put the base unit external sensor a second extra sensor and my old radio shack digital thermometer all in the same location and within a half hour they were all within 1 degree of each other indicating to me that the temperature sensors are consistently acccurate. i also had no problem with the lcd viewing angle; it is adjustable and seems to have a wide viewing angle anyway so i haven't seen any need to adjust it. one of my few complaints is that all external temperature sensors are shown on the display as outside temperature where in reality i would think it's more likely that most users will place one sensor outside and any extra sensors beyond that would be indoors (i could be wrong here). at first i was concerned that the forecasting function would be 'confused' by seeing several outside temperature/humidity readings that vary greatly but eventually i found one sentence in the manual that indicates only the first external sensor is used for weather forecasting. so it's a little confusing but works fine as long as you make sure that external sensor #1 is truly outside temperature. another heads-up is that the base unit is larger than i imagined and it looks pretty chunky sitting on my bathroom vanity. so be sure and read the dimensions ",positive
" the cover is great. the velcro holds the cover in place by wrapping around the handles preventing the wind from blowing it off. it's nice to leave the fireplace out in the winter knowing it is protected from the elements. ",positive
" we bought this fireplace and we love it! big enough to have a crowd of 10 or more people in lawn chairs sitting around and enjoying it (we had a family picnic and everyone commented on how nice it was). small enough for storage in our small shed for the winter. directions on putting it together were a bit confusing (per my husband). ours also came with an additional piece to allow for outdoor cooking in the fireplace (we haven't used it yet). ours also came with a cover to put over it when not in use which is perfect for keeping water out of it. great buy!! we use it frequently! highly recommend it.

" i really like these clocks. our school was constantly having problems with the clocks in all the classrooms being different and this has really helped the situation. the digital ones are better but the la crosse ones which are the least expensive also happen to be the best analog clocks we've tried ",positive
" the other reviewers accurately captured the clock's great features. i will add that its radio reception is great too. i put the battery in about 6:00 pm in california yesterday may 31 expecting it to get the correct time overnight. i noticed the second hand move a bit and stop and thought d*** it's broken already. not so! while reading the instructions to see what happened with the clock resting on the floor it started advancing to the exact correct time having received the radio signal in a minute since start. the clock is now in my office and i don't have to wonder if i have the correct time or not ",positive
" very easy to set up. pop in a aa battery push the button on the back for your time zone in the us (or you can set manually but then why? unless you are out of the us time zones.) find a spot on the wall for it hammer in a nail leaving it stick out a little to hold the clock put the clock up (the hardest part as it's just a hole flush with the back but! if you put it close to a door you can see the hole and the nail) and walla! in a few minutes the clock sets itself! what could be more easy? my cat even found it amusing to watch the clock hands move until the reached the exact time! ;) clock is made of finely textured plastic on outside but looks a lot nicer than in the picture. great to match black silver &/or designer computers black leather desk chairs etc. in an office or computer room. directions say to set it up late at night preferrably and that if used in interior rooms of office buildings it may not be able to pick up the signal to set and thus you'd do it manually. clock is larger than it looks as well which is easier on the eyes than other clocks. the price is certainly right as well. i bought an old black school-type clock for my kids when they were young very similar to this one and since my son took it with him when he moved out i wanted a replacement! (my mom bought the old one when my youngest was a baby when my older child was learning to tell time. it's been through being dropped when moving a few earthquakes and just keeps on ticking! i have the feeling this one will do the same as it's well made compared to many of the less expensive clocks out there - espcially the projection type which i thought might be a great idea until i saw the reviews on how many different projection clocks simply don't work are cheaply made and a friend's daughter got one for her birthday which didn't work either.) great for kids learning to tell time too so this could go just about anywhere in a modern decor room. awesome! i'm very happy with it so far ",positive
" this clock was very easy to set up...pop in a battery and within 5 minutes it sets itself. it's large face and numbers are easy to read at a distance making it perfect for business use. it was only a few dollars more than a clock with no automatic time setting so it was worth it to me to have at least one clock i'll only have to check when the battery wears down ",positive

" good product in general. one came a bit bent and the clever automatic lock unlock wouldn't work until i unbent it. i ordered 3 was billed for three and received 2. amazon is now junk in my inbox ",positive
" i was a little reluctant to purchase these because i had heard a lot of things about the spring mechanism in them being faulty but that they were being recalled and fixed. so i was wondering if the one i bought was a fixed model or not. well it must have the newer design because i've been using these for a few months and i have nothing but good things to say about them. i was previously using a long oxo set of tongs which were pretty good but a little flimsy for some of the heftier cuts of meat like whole chickens and pork shoulders. these tongs are sturdy! you know that the minute you pick them up and feel the weight to them. they can easily pick up anything you need on the grill and because of the 20 inch length you can keep you hand at a safe distance from the actual fire. the handle has grooves for your fingers and thumbs which enhances the grip and they lock in a closed position for storage. if you do any outdoor cooking you will appreciate these tongs. they're a well thought out piece of equipment you'll use for years and be glad you purchased ",positive
" well sometimes it pays to take a chance. after reading a negative review of these tongs i went ahead and bought them anyway...i do love steven raichlen's show and his books. well either i have a disagreement with the earlier review or they fixed 'em. these tongs work great are very heavy duty for handling big slabs of meat like i like to cook and the extra length keeps my hands cool without gloves. i vote 5 stars. keep on bbq'ing ",positive
" i use this for tailgating primarily. it is great because it's cooking size much bigger than it's counterparts. it holds temps well and cooks evenly like all webers do. it's a bit bigger than the smaller smokey joe but does a nicer job because of it's size. i use it often and will continue to do so. too bad it is being discontinued. ",positive
" this is a great portable grill for the size. the 14 one would be fine for 1-2 people but not more. this grill can handle more charcoal and has enough room to allow for 2 heat zones. the hardest part is finding one! i finally found one on ebay but you better hurry! ",positive
" i just had my platinum grill stolen and i'm not only devestated but having a hard time finding one available. just found one at ace. this is the perfect grill for anything. let's rally weber to make this more available! ",positive
" weber discontinued it and amazon no longer has it. my pal has a condo with a balcony (not large) this is the weber for her - equip it with one charcoal rail and you get lots of indirect heat for smoking. usually the 14 inch smokey joe's are too small often my 22 inch performer is too big but this jumbo joe is just right. weber - bring it back!! ",positive
" weber seems to have stopped producing this awesome grill. i'm so very disappointed that this great grill is discontinued. the smaller 14 smokey joe simply does not have the depth between the charcoal grate and cooking grate to hold enough layers of charcoal to reach a consistent high heat. this is the only portable charcoal grill that does it. if you want a portable grill that's actually useful this size is a must. i have tried them all. smaller grills cannot retain consistent high heat and you can forget about heating zones indirect grilling with the smaller portable grills. what weber may not understand is that many people have need for a good portable grill. city of chicago for example forbid any charcoal grill on the porch. so we have no choice but to carrry the grill outside. not to mention the big picnics outdoor trips parties in the park... small grills just doesn't do it. there's no open ash tray meaning you can just shut the vents snap the grill shut (with whatever in there) and wait 45 minutes the grill will be cool to touch and ready to sit in the car - no worries about ash coming out of it. the charcoal can be reused next time. it's awesome. i tried other brand portable big grills and the design is so horrible hard to clean doesn't retain heat etc. that just makes me miss this grill even more. i finally got this grill back after letting my friends use it for a couple of years. that's two years of abuse and it still looks shinny. i've missed this grill every summer since i parted with it and i don't think i'll part with it ever again ",positive
" though this is a portable grill it is terrific for at home use if you're single or have a small balcony apartment. it takes very little space and is easy to maneuver when cleaning time comes. we took ours to a picnic this weekend and grilled two packs of hot-dogs at once (16 thick dogs). because the grill is small things get hot quick and you will need to be careful with easy to burn foods that should take longer to cook. burgers do well steaks do fantastic. chicken needs a a watchful eye. i've used this gem for years. my apartments on the whole mandated the simplicity and efficiency offered up by the smokey joe. a great feature is the rounded top. this enables better smoking as air and smoke circulates more fluidly. the downsides: the legs aren't as sturdy as they could be. given time a bit of bumping around and general abuse and the screwed on legs might turn askew. if you notice this while the grill is hot you've a problem. the solution is to keep them tight during nonuse. the air intake at the bottom gets clogged with ashes. a key to good charcoal grilling is the manipulation of air flow. the intake might be open but stopped up. if you are diligent to clean the ashes you'll be ok. because the grill is so close to the ground you need to be careful. unlike most of weber's grill this one is also apt to getting kicked over run into by dogs cars and children. i fully recommend weber's smokey joe. now i'm hungry. time to stir the coals and pop on a few brats. anthony trendl editor hungarianbookstore.co ",positive
" if you like the big weber grills but need a small one for tailgating this is a great choice. i have no problem putting 3 4 or even 5 steaks on this grill with no problem. it's tight and well built. the only thing i don't like is the kind of cheap side went covers. they come flat so they don't conform to the shape of the grill. you have to kind of form them by bending them around your knee or something and then they fit fine. i give this grill 9 out of 10 brats. edit one year later: they made a big mistake moving the vent holes from the traditional place on the bottom of the kettle to the sides. it completely changes the air flow and the result is a consistently cold fire. my three minutes per side burgers on the normal webber are more like five or six minutes per side on this little grill. the bottom line is that this grill is ok for tailgating and camping but i don't use it nearly as much as i thought i would and if i had to have just one grill i'd get one of the other webbers with the vents on the bottom. this grill has been a disappointment for me ",positive
" i love this grill just last night i made pizza on it for the first time it's got a awesome amount of cooking space for such a portable grill. it's great we use it on our patio all the time. the build quality is great and it's very easy to clean i think they even added some vents into the design so the airflow is awesome... and with amazons free shipping you cant find a better deal anywhere ",positive
" this is an excellent little grill for home or the road. the lid lock is a godsend and the side benefit is that due to the construction of the piece smokey joe is an apt name. the carry handle is awesome. the side vents direct air such that i almost always have beautiful smoke filling my little grill and infusing my meal with fabulous flavor. i've had mine for over a decade and while i've gone through another big weber kettle and now a huge smoker this little number is still in the race and i have no intentions of giving it up. i'm taking it camping with me next weekend. it's a no-brainer. buy it and be happy ",positive
" this is a fantastic grill. i highly recommend it if you are looking for a high quality basic grill. assembly was rather easy and we were grilling the same evening. ",positive
" this is our second weber grill in the past 10 years. in fact the new grill is essentially the exact same grill as the one we purchased in the '90s...same size and features. we actually use natural gas rather than propane (i goofed on the order) but we were able to quickly transplant the conversion kit from the old grill to the new one. we've used it a few times and it works perfectly. quickly heats up and grills evenly. looking forward to many years of great meals off this grill ",positive
" for whatever reason weber has renamed the genesis line spirit for 2007. i just bought a new weber genesis 3 weeks ago (prior to the name change) after owning my last one for 11 years. there's a 3 burner model and a 2 burner model. if you're reading this you're looking at the 2 burner model. excellent product. 2 burners are more than sufficient; i don't know why they even have a 3 burner model since the 3 burner model isn't really that much bigger. the 2 burner model has plenty of room for the needs of everyday family grilling and entertaining a decent size group. there's plenty of product info on this page from amazon and the manufacturer so let me tell you a few things that i do to make my weber work best for me. -most importantly...keep it covered. amazon sells a cover...get it. not coving it will cut its life in half at least. -cover the funnel shaped grease drip pan with tin foil and change it regularly; otherwise build-up in the trap can catch fire and that does not make a steak taste very good. -change the disposable grease traps regularly (otherwise they start to stink). -get yourself a quality wire brush and use it before each use...not after. the build-up on the cooking grates after each use actually protects them from the elements. -before each use after you wire brush the grates put some cooking oil on some paper towels and wipe the grates down. -pre-heat the grill on high for at least 5 - 10 minutes; it burns off anything left over from the cleaning and makes the cooking grates nice and hot. -initiate cooking steaks chops any cuts of meat (even burgers...no not hot dogs) on just-over-medium heat for no more than 2 minutes on each side and flip before cooking to your liking. this brief searing of each side locks in the flavor of your cut of meat. -cook with a closed cover; normal cuts of meat shouldn't take more than a total of 10 minutes (including the searing). -let your meat sit for up to 5 minutes before slicing (or biting into it!). this locks in the juices; if the juices are too hot when you slice (or bite) they'll run right out of your cut of meat. there you go. hope that helps. and don't forget to cover the grill after it cools. bon appetit!

" so far i am very happy with this purchase. it seems to be relatively accurate with temperature humidity and pressure readings and the atomic clock sets itself every night. i love having the sunrise/sunset times as well as the moon phase displays and it's very easy to get that data for any city for any date without having to permenantly change the date or city on the unit. very cool. i don't like the fact that the moon phase display is backwards - a full moon in my opinion should be a full white circle and a new moon should be a black circle. this unit shows the moon as black instead of white. but once you get used to this it's no big deal. i really like the fact that all of the buttons are on the front of the unit. some other la crosse products have buttons on the back or other hard to reach places. i have found a few problems with the design. there is a curved glass (or plastic) cover over the entire display that is very reflective. the reflections make it impossible to read across the room. in fact it's difficult to read standing right in front of it because of the reflections. it's best to stand just slightly to the right or left. i was excited about the fact that the display shows the high and low temperature and humidity at all times for each of 3 sensors. however i was dissapointed that you can't recall the date and time that the high and low was recorded as you can with other la crosse products. also when you reset the high/low you have to reset all sensors at once instead of being able to reset each individually. it can be challenging to set up 3 remote sensors especially when you have more than 1 base unit but it can be done (i also have a la crosse alarm clock that projects the time and outdoor temp on the ceiling so i wanted to get both units to read the same sensor as #1). although this may sound like a negative review it's really not. the features and functionality of this unit far outweigh it's shortcomings. i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants the features it provides. make sure the dimensions fit your needs. it might be a bit large to sit on a desk - best to hang it on a wall. it also comes in oak instead of brushed aluminum sides.

" this is the third of three of these clocks that i have purchased for our city council chambers. at first i was somewhat leery that the location of our chambers would make it difficult for the clocks to automatically set themselves via the radio setting but this turned out to be unwarranted. as a result we have three clocks now that automatically keep perfect time all synchronized and all automatically adjusting for daylight savings time and standard time. in the past keeping three clocks in one room synchronized was impossible and was made more difficult since these were 15 feet up on the wall. the features of the temperature and humidity were an added bonus. the price was about 25% as much as compared to other clocks our city was investigating. in all i am totally impressed with these clocks their operation and their pricing so much so that i bought two for my home and one for my travel trailer ",positive

" after receiving my la crosse atomic clock i followed the 4 simple steps on the back of the box and left it hanging on my wall overnight near a window on the west side of my house. basically to set it up all you do is install a aa battery and press a button on the back of the clock to set your time zone (et ct mt or pt) the clock will do the rest overnight. the reception of the signal appearently clearest during the night according to the instruction manual. anyway the next morning after hanging it on my wall the clock was in perfect synchronization with the time shown on my directv satellite tv. i live in the greater seattle area and had no trouble receiving the atomic timekeeping radio signal from ft. collins co. i'd rate this clock a 5 star buy. the only slight downside is that the construction is inexpensive plastic (not metal) but then the clock would probably cost a lot more if it were metal. note: the manual warns that this may not work in the interior of a building. also the clock probably won't receive a signal if you're inside a metal-framed building (such as an office tower). wooden buildings with lots of windows will work best especially if you're far from colorado ",positive
" this is an attractive 10 clock white face silver bezel (also available with black). the unique feature is the ability to synchronize with the atomic clock (wwwvb) in ft. collins co. watching the hands speed around the dial as it initially sets itself is worth the price of the clock in itself. we bought one for a play room and liked it so much we bought two more. after placing the battery the clock begins searching for the signal. generally it only takes a couple of minutes to sync but it came take up to 24 hours. you need to set the time zone in which you live (pacific eastern etc). the clock automatically adjusts for dst (part of the wwwvb signal apparently). if you live in areas of the country that don't recognize dst there is a button on the clock to disable the dst offset. note that for the clock to receive the wwwvb signal it cannot be in a shielded environment. we've had no problems in our home placing the unit in various rooms with an outside window but i suspect it might not work in a windowless basement (in which case it functions as a regular clock). my company bought a ton of similar clocks only to find that they cannot receive the signal in a windowless steel building. your mileage may vary ",positive

" there's really nothing more that can be said to further the reputation of this series of grills. those of us that own the genesis e-310 series grill know how well this grill is manufactured and just how very well it performs its duties. it is by far the very best gas grill in this price range i have ever owned or used. a couple of notes: -the cross-over ignition system works wonderfully (it takes less than 3 seconds to fire up all three burners -those who say that their gas grill does not get hot enough to sear meats don't own this grill- i've had it up to 550 degrees on a very cold mn winter day -that said it seems to go through a good amount of propane when running all 3 burners on high...but that is probably obvious considering the temps you can obtain when running it on full. (it will be interesting to see if i can get 500 + degrees to sear meats on medium setting on a summer day....). the fuel gauge inside the cabinet is also a handy feature -as always with this series of grills- no flare ups and the flavorizer bars do what weber says they will namely vaporize fats and juices into smoke that adds flavor to what you are grilling -to keep this review balanced there is one negative- i dislike the tool holders. although there are plenty your tools pretty much have to have one of those leather hanging loop things to keep the tools from falling off or even to use the holders (a small price to pay i guess) finally the genesis e-310 i purchased came in a copper color something i haven't seen on amazon or on weber's site for that matter. maybe i missed it or maybe i got lucky. either way it looks pretty darn sharp on our deck when it isn't covered ",positive
" i bought this for my husband for christmas to replace an old (scary-looking) smoker. it was a real pain having to ask his folks to send mesquite wood from texas to massachusetts then cut it up soak it etc. we tried the bradley smoker this weekend while we had the unusually warm weather. it comes with pellets of wood which get fed in automatically; much easier. the prime rib was done in no time at all; we finished it off in the oven for a crispier outside. we also smoked fresh kielbasa. both were amazing. can't wait to try the cold smoke feature ",positive

" this is beautiful birdbath. if placed on solid ground (walkway concrete) it will be great. however if placed in mulch or in the landscape it is not weighted heavily on the bottom. a wind will not send it sailing but will cause it to tip. however it is beautiful and looks great while it is upright. i am still trying to figure out how to stabilize in the landscape mulch ",positive

" i have owned a brinkman smoker for 14 years...not this one but the more simple model that costs about $85.00. i have smoked several turkeys many chickens salmon pork roasts....all with great success. two things i can think of might help with your low temperature problem: 1. did you use an extension cord with it? i once had the same problem you had when i used a long extension cord. troubleshooting i searched the manual that came with it and found that it says not to use long extension cords (you'll have to search your manual for the maximum optimum length). please don't give up on your smoker! i get much more tender juicy results than i do with my flambeed grilled meats!! ha ha! the smoker is easy to use no fuss and not too bad of a mess to clean if you line your water pan with heavy duty foil! i use easy-off oven cleaner on my two racks and water pan and be sure to rinse them very well. i can leave for four hours and my food will be ready when i return (just be sure your water pan always has liquid in it) when we have company they love the smoked flavor. hope this helps. once i eliminated the long extension cord all was well. 2. were you peeking at your turkey or basting it? my lid also has a small gap through which the smoke escapes but it doesn't affect it. you cannot constantly open the lid to peek or baste as this allows the heat to escape and it will take a while for the smoker to reach the proper temperature again. no need to baste with a smoker! the meat is always juicy. i found your review because after 14 years i'm seeing rust on my smoker which was one of the best of our wedding gifts. i never owned a cover for it but always stored it in the garage when not in use. this last year however it spent much time neglected outside (i have four children now) and i wanted to research smokers to find the replacement for our trusty old one! i would highly recommend a brinkman electric smoker to anyone who is considering purchasing one (sorry i've never tried another brand). it's so much easier than grilling because you never need to watch over your food to prevent charring. i guess you could say a smoker is to a grill as a crockpot is to an oven except that unlike crockpot food the meat will appear beautifully golden-browned with no blackness. ",positive
" i have owned this smoker for 5 years now and have a few insights for those looking to purchase this smoker. i have smoked 7 turkeys alot of pork and some beef all with really great results. i love that its electric. regulating temp with charcoal smokers can be tedious. you barely have to do anything to it except add water and chips. it will maintain the ideal temperature of 220 degrees fairly well but there are a few issues with this smoker: 1. materials and construction- metal is thin and the lid fits loosely. the lid is suppose to fit loosely! there is no vent so it helps with the smoke. but because the metal is thin on cold and/or windy days it can be difficult for it to maintain it's temp on long smokes. often runs 200-210 degrees. this will increase your cooking time! on hot days it will run at 230- 240 degrees. although i can't reccomend this modification to help with heat loss i have actually heard of people fitting a electric water heating blanket to the outside of the smoker to help with this. 2. i wish the heating element was adjustable to help regulate the temp. 3. the door is small which makes it hard to add chips or water. although you can take the unit off its base to add chips this is akward and a bit dangerous since you may spill the water. it is nice to remove the base to help clean the unit though. 4. i installed an after market temp. gauge in the lid. (a must) overall a good entry level smoker that is super easy to use. got mine at w-mart for $75. anyhow it's a great value for under a $100. now after 5 years it is about done and i need a new smoker. i will try to upgrade although after looking around at all the electric smokers i might just buy another one of these. i love the bullet design of the vertical smokers. the stainless steel version of this model looks nice and is obviously made of better material but the main section is attacted to the base. i do like being able to remove the base. plus the element is still not adjustable. the only other choice is a stainless steel meco smoker which has a better door design and a adjustable heating element but is double the price. so i will either get this model again and do some modifications (temp gauge and maybe an adjustable element) or get the meco. hope this review helps.

" i picked up this smoker at lowes for a lot less than amazon. i also bought an inexpensive cover with elastic that works just fine. overall this is a good smoker. assembly took a while since the handles didn't match up with the holes on the smoker body and lid so i had to hammer at the handles a bit to get them to fit. otherwise assembly was easy. the food thus far has come out great. i have done salmon twice. i was smoking in 30 and 40 degree weather and the fish took the normal 2 hour smoke time. once it was heated and smoking the temperature stayed between 200-250 degrees. i'm sure it will do turkey breasts and brisket just as well also. i would recomend this to anyone who wants a fair priced entry level smoker ",positive

" we bought two of these. we were very impressed how easy the set up was. since installing the weather station - we have enjoyed the accuracy of the weather station both inside and outside temperatures. one feature of this weather station is a ice alert. up here in north we do get freezing rain ice and snow. this station has been right on the button with those predictions. i would highly recommend the purchase ",positive

" i have always wanted a turkey fryer but they was to spendy and at this price i had to get it although i was a litte reluctant buying it off the internet then i received it not only was i happy with iti was also relieved that i didnt get ripped off with another internet scam(thats why i ordered through amazonso i would be safe from fraud)anyway i havent yet fried my turkey but i know that they will taste great!!!!! ",positive
" i purchased one of these cookers at a grocery store for thankgiving. i didn't find out that amazon carried this brand until i went to the manufarturers website looking for the 10.5 quart fish cooker. i haven't deep fried a turkey and probably won't. my main use will be cooking brunswick stew and chili in large quantities for freezing and cooking fish and chicken wings. i'm considering getting a wok. i am very pleased with this cooker and would recommend it to any one wanting to use this for the reasons i use it for. it should also cook a turkey real well. the aluminum pot (and lid) is very heavy gauge thickness and the burner seemed to have a great deal of heat. the pot cleaned up just by spraying with the kitchen sink sprayer. i had to keep turning down the burner to get to a slow boil on my stew. a bottle of gass should last a long time. the 30 qt. pot was half full at the time. i can see how you could do some damage with one of these if you leave some oil unattended. the burner had two loose phillip screws from shipping and i hand tighened those. the stand and burner assembly are of sturdy construction. assembly instructions are well documented with photos. i started to return for a cheaper model at target but i'm glad i didn't. it's a great cooker even though some folks were mislead by some ad listings. i would buy again ",positive
" i love sunflower seeds chocolate and cherries so you can imagine my delight when i found these chocolate cherry sunflower seeds available on amazon. when the packet arrived i tore it open and downed the entire contents into my eager mouth expecting an explosion of chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity. instead i got a mouthful of hard shells. i crunched through the tough outer hulls wondering at the inventiveness of the manufacturers who had somehow injected chocolate and cherry flavors into hard unopened shells but then as i macerated both hull and softer kernel into a splintery mash found that the chocolate and cherry flavors had somehow gone missing. when my wife came home i mentioned to her how i was ripped off by the chocolate cherry sunflower seeds which lacked both chocolate and cherry flavors and in fact were barely edible. my wife picked up the empty packet looked at it for a moment and then hit me over the head with a dining room chair. you idiot she said these seeds are for planting. she then clobbered me with an antique oak coat tree. i don't know why i ever married you she continued you are always doing stupid embarrassing things and no matter how hard i hit you you never learn. she then whacked me with the coffee table for emphasis. maybe i had gotten a bad batch of seeds. i think i will order them again and the next time the manufacturers had better not forget the chocolate and cherry flavors or someone is going to get a beating ",positive

" i purchased the 300 pack of glow bracelets for our high school group to use as a fundraiser (selling at football games). it came out to about .06 cents per piece. what several of the kids were then doing was combining 3 of them to make a glow necklace (there are little clear plastic connectors that come with them so you can do that). the combined price of .18 cents far beats the price you get glow necklaces for at oriental trading ($1.00 each). and you can't really tell the difference between using 3 glow bracelets and 1 necklace. would recommend these for kids birthday parties fundraiser church parties etc. ",positive
" these glowsticks are really great. they are the perfect fund raisers. the colours are vibrant and they do last for hours. i have odrered and used these many times and they are my biggest sellers at carnival (mardi gras) time. some of the connectors in the last shipment however tended to crack after a while those came with the sticks in the blue 50pc packs. those that came with the yellow 100pc packs in my previous orders were perfect! all in all this is a very good deal. kids and adults alike are attracted to these bracelets.you will make quite a profit with them.

" i am a happy shopper - great value and fun way to quickly spruce up the yard. bought this for my mother-in-law and after visiting her house i had to have a few for myself. they hang from tree branches water spouts and lamp posts. i have even been able to hook the chains together to make them longer. i thought they would have a hole in the bottom for the water to drain from but i guess they are suppose to fill and slightly tip so the water overflows over the edge. that works as well. so far they have not changed color or rusted.

" this mosquito catcher really works. it was in the fall that i purchased this item and it has been running non stop since. the winter here in central virginia has been so mild that mosquitos are still alive. you may wonder if it really works and open the tray only to see about ten or more mosquitos fly out. it also has caught yellow jackets (bees) and small moths. great product i'm thinking of buying another one in the spring ",positive
" cheap and it works is really an understatement! item is quality made. just plug in and empty drawer every day or so. no bait or bags to buy. i ran this the last weeks of summer and could not believe the amount of dead mosquitos in the drawer. i highly recommend this item. ",positive
" after reading tons of reviews on various mosquito trap technologies i was skeptical that this one was any different. since the price was only around $90 i figured it was the cheapest 'gamble' out there so i bought it and put it in my backyard which has been pretty much unusable since june due to the aggressive mosquito population. sure enough i have emptied hundreds of mosquitos out of the drawer in the 3 weeks i have had it installed. my highest total in a day was 50. my lowest total in a day was 3 when i decided to add an octenol bait to this trap...which acted as a repellant as far as i can tell. this trap definitely works better in the dark when the little blue lights show up better. there are still mosquitos in my backyard and i still get bit. i think mosquito conditions are so bad that even after catching hundreds of them it hasn't had a significant positive effect yet. one word of advice i would like to give...place this trap away from any area you want to use. i moved it from the yard to my deck for a brief time and it was a bad idea. all the mosquitos from the yard were on my deck suddenly. yikes! we are nearing the end of mosquito season in atlanta as cool fall temperatures arrive so it will be hard to judge what effect removing a few hundred mosquitos will have. i am anxious to see how the mosquito catcher works next summer during the height of the mosquito frenzy. anyway if you've been wanting something to catch mosquitos with but have been afraid of the prices this is a product that can have positive results without breaking the bank ",positive
" i used this product for several days and caught several brown beetle looking insects and saw some small wings but was a little discouraged. that was when i checked it every few days..... i started checking it everyday and noticed that there were many mosquitos in the box. you have to look closely to see the types of mosquitos we have. they are small and dehydrate so quickly if you wait several days to check you may miss them. every two days i am catching about 12-16 mosquitos...roughly the same amount i killed when i would sit out on the back porch but now i don't have to wait to be bitten to kill them. may not work for some but patience and deductive reasoning helped me figure out that mine was working ",positive
" the tekquest mosquito catcher is a sturdy well built device that actually does what it claims. after setting up the unit according to directions i allowed it to run on 24 hr mode. (it also has a nightime only mode) i let it run for a few days and checked the collection tray. sure enough the remains of thousands of mosquitos and a moth or two had been collected. once the mosquitos have been captured the remains begin a decomposing process so there is very little left of the pests. after letting it run on 24 hr mode for several weeks i switched it to night only mode. once the sun sets the unit turns on runs allnight until the sun comes out. so far it has worked flawlessly and sitting out on our patio has become a welcomed event again. thank you tekquest ",positive
" first of all let me say that there are some reviews that you should ignore such as the one here that says that the easygreen sprouter is not a quality piece of equipment! i'm a very fussy consumer and i can honestly say that this is an outstanding unit of very high high quality. you can also do some google searches and you will find nothing but raves about it and what high quality it is. worth every penny! secondly i'm starting to believe that everone should grow sprouts to get the vitamins that we are not getting from the food in our grocery stores. as far as produce goes in our grocery stores you may as well eat the boxes that they are shipped in! over and over in the media these days we are hearing them say that our soils are so depleted in the first place and by the time we get the veggies and fruits in our grocery bags they have lost what little nutritional value they had! even the organic stuff is questionable by the time it gets to our table let alone the fact that some organic farmers are not really following the practices that produce nutritional food. they may not be using poisonous sprays but are they replentishing the soil? ok- enough of that! you can find tons of info about that on your own. if you want to do something fantastic for yourself and your family buy one of these sprouters and start getting the nutrition that your body begs you for! (no i don't work for them but wish i had designed it!) this is an incredible addition to the world of nutrition and a heck of a lot cheaper than buying expensive vitamins that your body can't absorb very well. we have spent thousands on vitamins over the years. who really knows what's in them anyway? you'll know exactly what's in your sprouts though. they are alive a packed with everything a vitamin pill wished it could be but can't!! it's so so easy you won't even believe it. it's fun to! the sprouts are outstanding and the cleanest most vitamin packed foods you will ever put in your mouth. load up a sandwich or toss up a salad or throw some in a smoothie. don't forget the brocolli sprouts are great!! i use about a half a dropper full of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide each time i fill it with water every day. (about one gallon) this is perfectly safe and actually helps oxiginate the sprouts as well as prevent mold. i was so impressed with my easygreen sprouter that i ordered three more of these (actually called easygrass sprouters) and purchased a wheatgrass juicer so that i can grow wheatgrass the miracle food. (check out ann wigmore the sprout book and her book on wheatgrass ) i can't say enough about the easygreen sprouter!! apparently people all over the world are catching on to this fountain of youth piece of incredible equipment! do some googling and see for yourself!

" my first objective was to find an alarm clock with a programmable snooze -- this one's got it. second objective was to be large enough for day-to-day use but also useable for travelling -- this one does it. the projection feature works great for me -- it's razor sharp and even at it's lowest setting very clear. if you can't see it in the day time look at he front of the clock (which can also be lit by leds by pushing any one button). yes the buttons are not the sturdiest but i believe that the need to use them often is negated by the fact it is radio-controlled. you set the alarm and display preference once and you walk away. for a $20.00 alarm clock i think it's a fantastic value ",positive
" i bought this clock specifically to have the time projected on the ceiling at night. my wife and i recently got new alarm clocks that use backlit lcd rather than led numbers and we found we were having a hard time reading them at night. we bought this clock as a solution. my 4 star rating is based on that use alone. it simply does not work during the daytime- the projector is not bright enough to complete with daylight or bright room lights. that's good- a light bright enough to be seen during the day would be far too bright for night-time use. you will be disappointed if you want to use this thing during the day. i would have given this clock a much lower rating if i had intended to use the atomic clock feature or to use it as an alarm clock. specifically: 1. the atomic clock only works in certain parts of the country. the atomic clock broadcasting station is in denver co and the further away you get from denver the less likely you will be to pick it up. we are on the east coast and our house is on the eastern side of a large hill and this clock has never picked up the atomic clock signal despite following the instructions meticulously. while it's possible we have a defective unit based on what i've read i just think we're in a bad spot and this unit doesn't have a very good antenna. the good news is that the internal clock seems to keep fine time. 2. the physical construction is very very cheap. it is extremely lightweight and easy to knock over. the power cord connection is flimsy and moving the clock (or knocking it over) will result in a loss of power (and your configuration if you don't have batteries installed). the buttons are especially cheap and poorly organized. it works fine for our use because we don't need to touch it but it would be terrible as a daily alarm clock- unless you are a lot more patient than i am at bedtime you would not want to try to set this thing in a sleepy state of mind. unless you are a lot more coordinated than i am immediately after waking up you would knock it off the nightstand regularly just trying to shut it off. it wouldn't stand up long to such abuse. but as i said earlier- if all you need to do is put the time on the ceiling it works admirably. *update*: after using this thing for about 3 months it spontaneously picked up the atomic clock signal. i have no idea why (we didn't change *anything*) but it's been locked for a couple weeks. - ",positive
" i love this clock. i wanted a small clock for my bedroom and didn't realize it projected when i bought it (was an impluse purchase when buying a dvd player) i can't live without it now. i am nearsighted so this is great in the dark. i have given four as gifts (that's what i'm buying today) and i find that when i go away it takes me a couple days to get used to the clock not being on my ceiling! i will always have a projection clock from now on. i couldn't live without it.

" bought this at my son's request. he used this for alarm clock and reading time in the dark. he has near-sightedness and the wall projection is just what he needs. ",positive

" i am not disappointed. this grill cooks hot. 500 degrees within about 10 minutes. in fact. i've had the grill about a month and i think i've grilled 25 days of the month. i need to watch it with all the meat but man i'm loving it. it's so convenient. my last grill didn't cook as hot. it didn't leave the grill marks. it didn't have the flavor of what this grill offers. there is not much to complain about. i dropped it while trying to put it together by myself. i thought it was going to break my floor not the other way around. this sucker is tough! i'm glad i didn't go cheap. i can't afford $1000-$2000 for a grill so this was a good medium for me. my last grill i paid $250 for. it rusted in 2 years and the replacement parts cost almost as much as the grill so i dumped it. i think i'll get my money's worth out of this weber. at this price even with the shipping it was cheaper to order online through amazon than to buy local. i consider this one of the smarter purchases i've made on amazon. **bad side. has nothing to do with the grill but amazon shipped it through a company named egl or eagle? for a logistics company they sure don't know what their doing. the delivery date kept changing and eventually it was a week later than the original estimated date. they sent it from reno to sacramento to chicago to omaha and back to chicago then back to omaha. from omaha they hired two dudes and a truck to drive it to des moines where i live. once in des moines they called me while i was at work. i met them at a gas station on the highway and lead them to my house. it took about 20 minutes to find them because the one that spoke english was still new to the language. no problem. they were nice enough fellas but i'm just not used to going to get my stuff when i order from amazon. i've ordered at least 50 items off of amazon. normally i track it thru the internet and it shows up at my door. in this case i had to call a freight company to get the status. then the directing drivers around business. i guess this was a special order and maybe that's why they can sell it at this price.

" i'm sure i'll eventually love this new weber ss grill. but it seems to take considerable time to get the grill properly seasoned so the burners give off sufficient heat to cook evenly. of course it's been winter since i received the grill making it difficult to exercise ample outdoor cooking to thoroughly test & enjoy the grill.

" after having purchased a 3 burner kenmore grill about 5 years ago and on my second replacement set of burners i decided it was time to invest in a quality gas grill. when i looked at the webers 5+ years ago they were quite pricey and not knowing much about grills i said heck no! well live and learn. after replacing burners twice at around $70 each time and the kenmore flavorizer bars at $40 all in 5 years i decided to bite the bullet and spend the cash. after lots of research on lots of websites i went with the gold b. so far it's been great. warranty and quality is a lot better then the kenmore and it should last a lot longer. my friend has had his siver c for 9 years and it's still going strong! delivery was quick! i ordered on a monday and it was delivered on friday. setup was easy. grill heats up very hot and quickly even though it's only 36000 btu's. i just ordered the rotisserie attachment for it and i'll provide feedback as soon as i try it out. this grill is now discontinued from weber as they have new models out now. i got this on sale at amazon for $466.00 on sale. i wouldn't pay anymore than that. look for a closeout deal on here or elsewhere. i'm sure they will start popping up.

" i just got this grill a couple of days ago and i am psyched! i've always been a bit of a charcoal snob but i wanted to expand my repertoire beyond just the weber charcoal grill and the bradley smoker i have. it was a snap to put together and it only took me about 20-25 minutes. i was able to lift it onto the legs in step 3 by myself without a problem; you just need to be careful. i did a ton of research and opted for the weber mostly because of my experience with their quality products and i didn't want to chance it with a semi-unknown brand from home depot. i chose the genesis gold as i don't necessarily like all the stainless steel framing in the genesis platinum line but i wanted the stainless steel grates and flavorizer bars that the genesis silver doesn't have. also i wanted the b as opposed to the c as i don't really use the side burner. it lights quickly and evenly and it does heat up in a jiffy; i do like the convenience of gas. i've also got a smoker box for the grill to add the smoke that i like to compensate for the lack of charcoal flavor. however for low and slow true barbecue i'll stick with my bradley smoker as the water vapor from the propane as it burns doesn't allow proper penetration of the smoke into the meat. this grill rocks.

" i bought this table with the four chairs also made by strathwood. i have it on my patio where i can see the flame from our hot tub and it looks gorgeous burning in the dusk. i have had a number of people comment on the way it looks and i have been unable to find a better value. it looks like it is a lot heavier than it is as it is remarkably easy to move and was a piece of cake to assemble even by myself. the drawbacks are that the black mesh screen needs to be stored somewhere else (there are no hidden nooks where you can stick it for easy access when you decide to light the fire) and it sits lower than your average table so if you need to sit and use the table to work or read it isn't going to work for you. it is fine for eating casually though. there are little screws in the bottom of the legs so you can level the table without using other hardware and if you have an uneven surface like i do you can move it around and adjust it easily to stop any wobbling. the other issue i have is that the chairs made by the same company don't fully fit under the table the armrests are a little too high so they won't push all the way under the table.

" this table is quite attractive and substantial. it sits a little lower than a standard patio table however one can still sit comforatbly near the table. i suspect this is to prevent one from getting their legs under the table and too close to the fire pit bowl. one negative:two of the screws where the legs attach to the ring assembly did not fit well and were exteremly difficult to tighten all the way. i almost was forced to cut the screws shorter. i added some machine oil to the threads and gently worked the screws deeper into screw holes. overall satisfied with the table...and it is quite attractive ",positive

" i had used a friend's hammock chair before buying my own but his was made of very thin synthetic threads that catch quite easily on buttons etc. not so with the charleston! the cotton rope that makes up the weave is very comfortable to sit in all on its own or with the chair cushion that is provided and if it happens to catch on something it's no big deal. all i have to monitor with the kids is how far they swing... i love it my wife loves it my kids love it. can't wait to take it camping this summer (though i may never leave the chair. someone else has fire duty from now on) ",positive
" i have had to replace the igniter twice in almost 15 years. the igniter was actually still quite good. it is very well made as are most weber products. the stainless steel gas box is what eventually fails due to rusting (yep stainless steel will rust especially if subjected to heat). it is easy to replace and i end up giving the entire grill a cleaning and tuneup. ",positive
" can't say too much for a replacement ignitor system but it works. it installed as easily as expected and appeared to be of a slightly better quality than the part that it replaced. if the previous part is any indication it should last about 5-7 years hard to believe in this time of designed obsolesence ",positive
" my grill isn't a webber but i was still able to get it installed by cutting the top of the metal covering the electrode to make room for the burners. lights the grill everytime ",positive
" very simple to install if you need a new starter. however after installing a new starter new burner tubes and new flavorizer bars (all easy) i discovered that something was wrong with one of the valves in my manifold. i recommend this kit highly if you need a new starter but make sure you actually need one. first turn the gas on and spray windex (easier than soapy water) over everything that might be leaking ",positive
" i just rebuilt the genesis i. it didnt need the igniter as it lit on the first click every time anyway. but changed it as it was 7 years old or so. also changed the flavorizor bars as they were about worn away ",positive
" i have had a weber silver b grill for several years. i have found that the igniter works for about two years then just does has to be replaced. this is an easy replacement and is not expensive. this ignighter works as well as any i have seen and i think the minor cost and inconvenience of replacing the ignighter is offset by the quality of the grill. ",positive
" this product arrived in a timely fashion and fit the grill perfectly. ",positive
" very easy to remove old igniter and install this one on my weber spirit 500 grill. took about 5 minutes and started up on the first push of the button. no more trying to light a match and stick it through the hole on a windy/cold day ",positive
" i sent this to my in-laws foy christmas and they loved it!! they recently added a backyard garden and they are thrilled to have it and love how it looks. i am told it is quite comfortable as well ",positive
" the bench is comfortable and has enough weight so the wind does not blow it over. the cushion is real nice and it dries quickly plus it fastens to the bench with only two small velcro straps.two people can sit on the bench in comfort ",positive
" this garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive. the color is elegant. i have it in a small sun room and it is perfect. the cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs but the cushion itself could be heftier. the bench is lightweight giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy but has supported whatever i have subjected it to---and i have 10 dogs that love a couch! i would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam ",positive
" this bench is fabulous and the cushions are a very good quality. we purchased the entire collection and could not be any happier. they were boxed superbly so there was no damage at all and the quality is amazing...obviously we love this product! ",positive
" i thought the bench was a very good buy for the money. it fits perfectly on a small area of our deck ",positive
" i needed a nice bench for the entry but didn't want to settle for the same old bench like everyone else has so i stumbled upon this one and i love it!!!! it's well made and the cushion is very plush! the colors are perfect! love it! if you are looking for a nice and classy bench this is it ",positive
" prompt delivery packaged well and the best part no assembly required. the finish is a brown tone cast aluminum. it's very well made. it looks terrific with my matching fire pit table. at some point i want to get the matching chairs. beautiful set ",positive
" the pump works well certainly as good as can be expected for the excellent price! it does however leave at least an inch of oil in the bottom of the pot. the instructions say that this last bit of oil is too dirty and it is best discarded. in reality the design of the pump just doesn't allow it to suck oil up from that low a level. i was however able to sufficiently filter most of these last few cups of oil using the pump and a large-mouth jar. when poured into a jar with a much smaller diameter the oil is deep enough that the pump can get to it leaving only a small amount that i didn't mind discarding ",positive
" a very nice thermometer very simple to use to read and pretty accurate for a thermometer of this price; at least it is more accurate than the local weather company. made in china try to don't drop it. something that could be kind of annoying is that every 3 seconds the lcd will display the hour and after those 3 seconds will display the temperature if it doesn't botter you (like me) you should buy it. i tested it in temperatures from 15c to 25c and works fine. 1 year warranty in the us and canada ",positive
" i bought this item after being bit in the face by a spider while i was sleeping. it was not a pleasant experience! we stirred them up after poking around in the attic during an afternoon. i was finding the nasty buggers everywhere until i got this unit. since plugging the bugfighter in i've not seen a spider or any insects on any of the 3 levels of my home. i have one in the basement and one in the upstairs hallway. they've been running about 2 months now. we've even re-checked the attic and not a spider to be found. i'm in northern va and we're coming into spring now. it will be interesting to see what happens. usually i get crickets and a bout with ants and termites as the season kicks off. if i don't post an update you know all went well and there were no insect battles this year. if i have ants and/or termites...you'll be the 1st to know! specific point...no noticeable change in electric bill for 2 months of use. ",positive
" i hate to admit but we have roaches! actually we had roaches until last week when i purchased this product. i had tried everything: sprays bombs traps etc... but nothing worked. the first day i plugged this little device in there was such a great increase in bug activity that my kids wouldn't go into the kitchen. by day 3 the roaches were gone! i don't know where they went and i don't care. this device saved my sanity ",positive
" we love this product. it was easy to set up and it's great knowing what time it is without having to turn a light on. the only thing i don't like is the alarm it's very annoying. ",positive
" i like oregon scientific products but their previous atomic alarms had quirky controls -- often leading to changing the time zone in the middle of the night rather than turning off the alarm. this one's lots better! the projection feature works ok though doesn't really focus sharply at the close distances i'd prefer to use. the eight minute snooze alarm is great -- just the right interval! overall a nice useful moderately expensive alarm clock ",positive
" this was the ideal instrument for us. we like to walk in the early morning - when the temperature outside is above 40 degrees! the projected time and temperature tell us whether we need to get out of bed - or can sleep in a little longer. the weather forecasting feature is also useful - and at least as accurate as the tv forecasts ",positive
" this was a present for my wife. i thought it was pretty cool for her to have the outside temperature and the time projected on the ceiling next to her bed and for me to never have to reset the clock with daylight saving time. i received the typical luke warm response when i buy her anything that has the appearance of a gadget. (men know what i mean; you really bought this for yourself didn't you type response) well my wife has even admitted her initial impression was wrong! i was right! (drumroll fireworks 21 gun salute jet fighter overflight) she loves it. this thing is more useful than a cell phone fax machine and a swiss army knife combined. it works great does all kinds of things that you would like to know about in the middle of the night and early in the morning (it even provides a halfway decent weather forecast)has a really nice understated look that says what it does without being in your face about it and is in the perfect price range. if you want to give somebody a nice little gift that will be appreciated every day this might just be it. ",positive
" i have had this product for a year now. when i first purchased it my wife thought it was another of my goofy gadget ideas but after a few nights with it projecting on the ceiling she grew to love it. the projected image can be rotated and focused and even without my glasses i can read it in the dark (and my eyes aren't that good). it will *not* be visible when the room is lit. it is great to be able to read the current time and remote temperature in the middle of the night when you wake up. out of the box the radio-sync'd clock easily picked up the remote sensor (for another oregon scientific clock we have) on the back porch and synched to wwv in colorado within a few minutes. over the last year it has performed flawlessly except for the time when we had to change the batteries on the remote which required a reset of the mother ship. a tip: when you change the batteries on either the remote or the base clock change both sets. if the unit does not show the temperature after changing the battery reset it using a paper clip in the reset hole. i also have the lacrosse projection clock in our other house and this oregon scientific model is a superior product i believe to the lacrosse equivalent ",positive
" love the large illuminated time/temp on the ceiling. setting up the external temperature sensor was a bit tricky you'll need to make sure you have a glasses size screwdriver which i didn't have readily available. otherwise everything worked as promised. i am still not positive if the atomic sensor is working. the instructions said you have to be something like 750 miles (or was it 1000) away from the location in denver etc. i am in detroit so the signal never seemed to sync up but it may have i am not sure. all in all a great purchase. ",positive
" a nifty widget of the highest order. it projects on the ceiling automatically corrected time and outdoor temperature. in addition it tells indoor temperature and weather predictions at least as good as the local weatherman. most alarms enrage when awakening this one is very pleasant but persistent if necessary. the instruction manual seems like it was written by someone that had a taxi waiting but you can stumble through to the correct setting in time. i am very happy with this item ",positive
" i have purchased three of these benches and will be getting two more. they are beautiful to look at and extremely comfortable. they are well engineered and assemble in less than 15 minutes. i can't comment on how they weather as i've just received them but being cedar they should do well. i was disappoiinted with the american woods accessory side tables. they don't have the sturdy and well built look that the benches have. i purchased two will keep them but not get any more. stay tuned i just bought the glider and will write a review after i receive it ",positive
" i bought this to fill with sands and candles for an indoor area. it creates a cozy and warm addition when we watch movies and sports. the cover is a nice protective from the kids touching the candles. the sand protectes the fire pit from getting to warm. ",positive
" since i have started using this unit i have cooked my best thanksgiving turkey my best christmas ham and my best new year's pork roast ever. the only reason it's not 5 star is that i've needed the booklet almost every time i've used it. the controls aren't difficult but they aren't really intuitive either. i'd go 4-1/2 stars if i had the option ",positive
" we were reluctant to buy this product because of some bad reviews we read about it but we are really glad we decided to buy it! so far we have not seen one single bug or rodent or spider around! and believe me we live in a mountainy area so we used to see them around all the time in our garage. i have not seen them ever since we bought this product. it is working for us ",positive
" we have a really bad bug problem (inherited with the trailer when we got it) - these things do work - no bugs in my sisters or mothers houses anymore but we do still have bugs. we do move the 2 units around as recommended - bugs can get use to them. also stuff in your house can absorb the noise making them less effective - we are wall to wall stuff with 3 kids in a tiny trailer. to effectively do our trailer would take 8 - 10 units. bugs that we do see are easier to catch and seem disoriented. these buzzers are best used in wide open spaces with minor to middling bug problems. the spiders and beetles and moths have totally disappered though. our dog hates the things when we move one over by her bed. so these units need to be moved every 2-4 weeks. you need multiple units - 1 for every 200 sq. ft. at least - if you have lots of furniture or smaller rooms then more - they don't work through walls or furniture. you need at least one for every room that you have a problem. it takes 2 - 3 weeks to really start to see results. works better if you have fewer bugs - for a really bad bug problem - use in conjunction with other solutions ",positive

" i was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when i sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what i needed and wanted to cancel the order. he very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and i was impressed with this service. gayla tregr ",positive
" unfortunately i wanted a spatula and wok to use in the house not outside. therefore i just recently returned it. but it was great! ",positive
" we had bought one of these for this house loved it so much we bought one for the other house too. the original one was bought w/ the 22 wok which is gorgeous. we use both w/ woks and it's kewl. easy to break down for travel too. only thing was i shoulda bought the cover for the 22 wok while they were available. can't seem to get one now. ",positive
" this is the best outdoor cooking item i have ever used. it has very high btu's and cooks very quickly. when using it as a wok it takes the grease out of the kitchen that used to linger for days. we cook all greasy foods outdoors it is extremely fast and the food comes excellent. we use it more than out bbq. ",positive
" wow! this burner really rocks. it sounds like a jet engine when you crank it up high. it really kicks out the heat. i have had it for 2 days now and used it both nights for dinner. brought a very large pot of corn to boil in no time. but still had the control to steam crab legs without boiling the water dry. very impressed with the range of flame control. the grid reverses from a bowl shape for woks to a flat side for pots and pans. really nice. i could not be happier ",positive
" i have an electric range and a propane bar-b-q. this burner has been very useful and was the least costly alternative to accomplishing what i wanted to do. i make 10 qts of salsa wo heating up the kitchen. a turkey roaster i bought as an accessory really works well with the burner. my cousin likes to fry potatoes and chicken wings. this burner can really put out the heat ",positive
" i set the buner in the backyard fire it up. the jet engine equivalence heats up extremely quick and i finished sauteeding meat/vegie in no time. and they taste great full of favor. all i need to do now is building a outdoor kitchen so i don't have to keep moving all the ingredients in and out of the house. ",positive
" 65000 btu -- loud hot powerful enough to cook as many french fries as you can cut -- all at once and keep the oil at 375 degrees effortlessly. the best fried fish you've ever had cooked in about 2 minutes. fried calamari in about 30 seconds. probably the best $49.95 purchase you could make for the kitchen. (okay the warning says to use it outdoors and to have a fire extinguisher handy.) cook with a wok the way it was meant to cook -- get the peanut oil smoking in about 20 seconds. a bit of a pain to store and the flame control is rather crude but man this thing is one hot burner. burner ring is reversible to hold woks with the concave ring and a big flat pot (for deep-frying a turkey) with the other side ",positive
" very very happy with this appliance. i was a bit sceptical before ordering when i read about `stamped metal' but when it arrived yes it's stamped metal (not every component is though) but very heavy gauge metal and very well engineered. i used it immediately after i received it and wow! talk about the `dragon`s breath!' very high btu's and the food cooked like i never have experienced. finally authentic oriental cooking at home. highly recommended. update: well i've been using this for quite a long time now and i am even more pleased than ever. i remember asking a chinese chef in china town how come i can't make food like this at home. he stated (in a heavy oriental dialect) you gotta use hot wok. wok gotta be very very hot! yep that's the secret. you will never replicate authentic oriental cooking on an ordinary gas or electric stove. you gotta use hot wok!! and this devise puts out the btus for a very hot wok indeed ",positive
" i purchased 2 of these last year. there are lots of wooden chairs and other furniture out there but few made with a wood anyone can pronounce. since i am a woodworker and live in oregon i knew ahead of time i would treat this chair so it will retain its color and last in the rain. any type of clear wood deck sealer will do and the trick to having a lasting chair is to place a small amount of liquid nails in each joint before screwing it all together (this chair does require assembly but it is ez). if you seal the wood and secure the joints this chair should last many years. i still love mine and they look great and because of the liquid nails...there are no creaks or movement whatsoever so i don't have to worry when my larger friends sit in them ;-)...buy them now...they are well worth it!! ",positive
" my patio is filled with american woods furniture. last year i bought four of these sturdy cedar chairs as well as a matching table chaise lounge and serving cart. they all still look great even after enduring two record-breaking wet summmers. however i do opt to stain them once a year (the manufacturer recommends superdeck clear stain) just to keep them looking rich and dark but you can let them age to a natural gray color if you prefer. i researched wood patio furniture thoroughly before going with american woods products. and while you can find less expensive items you'd be hard-pressed to find anything that's as sturdy substantial and well-built as american woods. they're built to last and i know i'll be enjoying my patio furniture for years to come ",positive
" just from looking at the picture i can tell that this chair is made from redwood and is constructed with &quot;mortice and tennon&quot; joints. a very solid method of construction. my only hesitation is that there are no measurements given. plus if the chair and chair back slats aren't thick enough they will be prone to spliting ",positive
" i keep seeing this companies outdoor furniture am tempted to buy but wish someone who's purchased some would post on how it weathers. my porch is uncovered so weathering could be a problem. thanks ",positive
" amazon service and weber quality! replaced a few parts on my weber grill to extend its life. moved up to the stainless steel flavor bars and they are terrific; looking for them to last more than the 15 years my porcilin flavor bars did with the same great grilling experience. my weber grill is up for more than another 15 years of great grilling ",positive
" stainless steel bars will last longer than plain enamel/metal bars which lasted a ling time in all kinds of weather since we leave our weber grill outside all year. cookung results seem to be the same ",positive
" item arrived very soon after ordering using the free shipping option. product is of very good quality manufactured by weber -- not a look alike manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of ",positive
" this upgrade is worth every penny. i agree with the reviewer that felt that heating was more even. i would add that they seem to burn the drippings off better and keep the inside of the grill cleaner. there is no doubt in my mind that the addition of this product makes the original design all the better ",positive
" the cooker is very versitile. we used it in the last week for a fish fry and then a low country boil. the product works fantastic ",positive
" this cooking set was on sale and even with shipping beat the best prices locally. i gave it to my son as a gift and he was thrilled to get it. it included the pots lids lifter that were also good quality. very nice set. good quality/good value ",positive
" i have used the fryer for chicken wings which is what i bought it for because i have plenty of parties throughout the year. along with the professional look of the product it performs great! if i could give it 10 stars i would. it is the best fryer i have ever used and that says alot. i would recommend this fryer to anyone looking to enhance their outdoor cooking and bring it to that next level.

" i got my chia herb garden about a month and a half ago and making them grow has been very easy and pleasant. they are still tiny but they are doing good. my advice is to follow the instructions carefully: frequent watering trimming full sun or artificial light as explained in the instructions and plant food. not only they can be used in cooking they are very decorative and cute ",positive
" i received the chia herb garden about 3 years ago and not only was it easy to start but most of the plants are still going strong. i have more chives and parsley than i know what to do with. these are also some of the tastiest herbs that i've ever eaten ",positive
" i received this as a christmas gift last year. i followed the instructions in january and by march the sprouts flourished into plants. by summer i had repotted all of them twice and they are now huge. my friends are always shocked at the growth of my basil tree as they call it. i owe my success to south-facing windows and religious watering (infused with drops of plant food.) i don't have a green thumb at all - in fact i'm a known plant-killer. but i was able to get the chia herb garden to grow like a charm. ",positive
" this is compact and fairly accurate. i use it inside my bedroom to check humidity levels and it is quite helpful. would recommend ti to anyon ",positive
" i wanted this since i didn't trust the humidity reading on my humidifier. has large and convienent display. due to its size and battery power i can easily move it around the house to check temp/humidity in different rooms ",positive
" very satisfied with the performance of this meter. have been looking for a relative humidity meter for some time that was accurate and durable. the temperature is also included which is great. price is very good for what you get !! ",positive
" i purchased 4 of these units to track temperature and humidity in a tack room a woodshop a boat storage garage and a craft room that are all located in my horse barn. each room has a thermostatically controlled electric wall heater but the thermostats are not very accurate therefore i am using these units to assist me with the temperature settings. i tested all four units together. the four temperature readings were within a 1 degree range; the four humidity reading were within a 1% range. the housings are thin plastic and the min/max button has to be depressed hard in order to access the min/max readings in succession. you will not be happy with these units if you intend to use them as wall instruments in your home simply because they look and feel cheap. they are practical --- and you cannot beat the price ",positive
" this comfort meter works very good. the shipment came in time for a gift for christmas. one for us one for gift. ",positive
" this little weather station works well and is pretty simple to set up. you will have to read the instructions to get the remote sensor to sync but otherwise easy. i found this to be one of the better looking units from os. it has medium size numbers and is easy to read. by reading barometric pressure and outdoor temp and humidity it does a pretty good job of predicting weather. in order to get outside temp there is a remote sensor. to be effective you need to mount it in a shady area with a screw. also the instructions suggest the more expensive lithium batteries (not included) for the remote sensor because alkaline batteries will only measure temps down to just below freezing then the batteries freeze. lithium batteries will allow temp readings all the way down to a chilly -22. my only disappointment with this unit is the main display is not wall mountable only desk stand. also the radio signal for the clock setting comes and goes ",positive
" i bought two different atomic clock/weather from this company. both with outside monitors. it works just as it is supposed to. one puts the time on the ceiling and the other doesn't. they both read both the outside monitors like a charm. some of the buttons are a bit confusing in the dark. once i set the alarm by mistake and at 2am i just had to put the thing in another room. i could not find the off button ",positive
" really like this weather station. it seems very accurate in temperature and humidity readings both indoor and outdoor. finding the proper batteries for the outdoor unit was a hassel in this area. shipping was fast and am very pleased. ",positive
" i have owned this clock for 3 yrs now and just love it. the numbers are easy to read and set-up was a breeze. i've changed the batteries only once during this time. very accurate on the in-door and out-door temperatures. i definately recommend this clock ",positive
" this items is just great. as we get older we need number that we can see from our recliners. ",positive
" i owned the ws-8248u for a couple years and really like it that i decided to buy two ws-8236u for my two other bedrooms. setup is easy. i don't have to manually correct the time for daylight saving time anymore. the time is correct down the second. really love it ",positive
" picked up the time signal within five minutes. set your time zone and you're in business. no more guessing if you have the correct time; no more resetting twice a year for dst. large display characters are easy to read. neutral design fits with most any decor. i would have preferred the moon phase colors to be reversed - a full black circle is actually a full moon ",positive
" despite the fact that this clock hangs in my basement rec room in cincinnati it has had no problem receiving the time signal from colorado. it should be noted though that as the manual mentions the proximity of a powered-up tv or computer monitor can interfere with reception of the signal. as an owner of some expensive acoustic guitars i find the hydrometer readout very useful for monitoring room humidity. and the readout is big enough to be easily visible from across the room. i only wish this thing looked a little less purely utilitarian. big and clunky two-tone silver it adds nothing to my room aesthetically. ",positive
" this was such a hit at christmas for my son. great gift idea and fast shippin ",positive

" living in florida we grill almost daily. i seem to burn out a set of enamel grates every 15 months or so. hopefully the stainless grates will last much longer. without a doubt the best price for the grates in store or online was at amazon!! ",positive
" what is bad to say about these great grates? uniform heat easier cleaning than the cheaper porcelain grates and a great replacement/upgrade for my 4 year old weber. with these and new flavorizer bars i plan on many more years of use for this grill. my only wish is that they were a little cheaper on amazon--price didn't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal ",positive
" after having a porcelain grate that rusts even though i cover my grill i decided to upgrade when replacing. after seasoning (cooking on it 1/2 dozen times) the grate performed great. no sticking no rust cleans up well ",positive
" i've been using the stainless steel weber grates for a few weeks now having replaced the old porcelain ones. i think the heating is quicker more event and perhaps even more absorbing for the items on the grill. not sure if that makes sense but it seems that the foods seem to heat through adequately in a shorter amount of time without getting overcooked. i do tend to keep the burners down low and turn the cover down on almost everything i cook. i'm a little disappointed that the grates don't stay shiny stainless steel even in the areas on which i don't lay down foods. i guess that's because of all the heat swirling around when i have the cover closed. all in all i give this a hearty recommendation ",positive
" these are a big improvement over the porcelin ones.... the food seemed to cook faster and tasted better... they were heavier than i thought they would be and was a perfect fit for my silver b. ",positive
" the replacement grates were as promised and a worthy investment. i was impressed with the speed i received them ",positive

" i recently gave my weber genesis a facelift with all new parts. while weber is obviously a quality product amazon must be commended for bringing these products to the public at reasonable prices. prior to this purchase i bought the stainless steel drip bars for my grill at sears. (always get the ss) with a storewide 10% off and an additional coupon they allowed me to use i still paid 45 cents more than an amazon purchase. i only relate this story because i am the last of the online buyers. resisted this method for years. but amazon has yet to fail me in the last 6-9 months on any order. and while 45 cents is no big thing it certainly is more convenient to go to the door for a fedex delivery than shop at sears. so...great product great price and great online service. what more can you ask for ",positive

" i have had a weber silver b grill for several years. the grill is great but the steel flavorizor bars rust and have to be replaced (i replaced my bars twice in five years). i have just started using the ss bars but i am sure they will be better than the old bars and well worth the extra initial cost. if i had been able to get the ss bars earlier (not usually available from local markets) i probably would not have had to replace the bars as i did (twice). i highly recommend spending the extra dollars for ss bars when the originals fall apart ",positive
" what a difference flare ups are gone perfect fit in gril ",positive
" after having my silver b for 7 years the origional porcelin bars were very rusty. my grill would flare up terribly. i thought it might be from the rust holding the drippings and grease and making the flares worse. i was right! these stainless units (the length is listed wrong here) are great! i just cooked brauts without a flare up! price was great; thanks amazon ",positive
" purchased for the weber genesis silver a. it is a genuine weber replacement part; fits and operates perfectly. easy installation and cheaper than buying from weber directly. ",positive
" i'm not sure quite what to say about the burners. as expected they work extremely well and they were rather easy to install. the only problem i had was with a bolt that had rusted and required a little time to get off. beyond that i had my grill lit within 15 minutes of taking the burners out of the box ",positive

" if you are expecting a huge chiminea then move on. but if you want a medium sized one that is easy to assemble and good looking then this is the item for you. it took about 10 minutes to put together with two people (and i am not mechanically inclined) and it feels very solid not flimsy or cheap. it is probably about 30 lbs. i used one half of a duraflame (fake fire log) in this chiminea the first time i used it and i was glad i did. the burning area is kind of small and if i had used a full log i would have had an inferno! even with the small log the flames lept out of the unit a bit so keep it away from anything flammable. maybe regular wood/sticks would work better i don't know i have yet to try that. overall i am happy with the item because it is a nice convenient size works well and looks very nice ",positive

" carbon steel like cast iron does need to be seasoned. but once it's done it's very non-stick. an easy way to season: scrub the cookware using a green scrub pad and scouring powder. rinse well and wash with regular dishwashing liquid. rinse again. dry in a 325f oven for about 20 mins. if you like cool it a bit to make it easier to handle but make sure to continue to the next step while the cookware is still warm to the touch. coat the inside and outside of the cookware with a good coat of vegetable oil--not so heavy it's dripping everywhere but more than a thin coat. of course use caution with the hot cookware. put it on a few old towels and use a paper napkin saturated with oil to coat the pan. bake upside down at 325f for 45min-60mins. you might want to put al foil on the rack below the cookware to catch any excess oil that drips. repeat coating the warm cookwarw and baking at least one more time. a third time is great. after the final coat of oil is done turn off the oven and let the cookware cool in the oven. the cookware should now have darkened with a subtle sheen. the finish will be rock hard and smooth--not sticky at all. treat it well. i do use diluted dishwashing detergent and a scruber to clean my cast iron and have never had a problem with the seasoning coming off. just don't let it sit soaking in water for a long time. it will still rust. i let some friends borrow my lodge dutch oven for a campout. they let it soak overnight and scraped it to clean it and didn't dry it out well--the seasoning was chipped off. it came back rusted! so i just had to scrub it out to remove the rust and redo the seasoning... it came back almost as before except for the pitting caused by the rust--however this is just a cosmetic thing. it still works fine. depending on how often you use the item you can give it a touch up seasoning... just make sure it's clean and dry before giving it an oil coat and baking and cooling ",positive
" i found the 16 lacrosse atomic clock to be exactly as described. the metal case is sturdy and good looking; the directions very straight-forward. 16 is big. be sure you want this diameter. they make smaller units. i am quite satisfied with my purchase ",positive
" the back panel broke when taking it out of package that is the packaging though not the clock. it is in working order and keeps one 'on time' ",positive
" after having trouble with a different atomic clock i decided to try again. i chose the lacrosse atomic clock after reading other reviews from customers and searching online. overall it's been great. i was able to quickly set it up in my office; the instructions are simple and easy to follow. my office is in a nyc commercial building mostly made of mortar and brick with a steel frame. initially i did not receive the signal in the day. but the instructions pointed out that the signal is strongest at night and the clock would most likely set at night. sure enough the next morning it was correctly set (even with the earlier daylight savings time). i've found the black background with white numbers particularly easy to read from a distance. my only concern was the same as that of other customers: amazon packed it poorly and the inner box holding the clock was totally free to bounce around in the outer box. fortunately the outer box protected it enough and the clock arrived unscathed. overall i consider myself lucky given the condition of many boxes delivered to my office building. otherwise this is a nice accurate easy to read clock with a sense of style as well ",positive
" so it's not a big deal to reset your clocks when the time changes and when the power goes out right? well... yes it is. as i get older and technology becomes more demanding and time consuming the fact that i can have one device that takes care of itself has become fairly important to me. it's just a clock but... it works. which is more than i can say for my fax or copier or phone or... i always get lacross because i like the looks of their stuff. be good to yourself- upgrade to atomic ",positive
" i ordered this clock and then had to send it back two times before it finally arrived undamaged (actually minimally damaged). the first two times the glass was cracked and broken. by the third time all that was the matter was minor dent marks in the metal frame where the packaging must have pressed down on it (this is only noticeable in certain light angles). the shipping problems weren't the manufacturers fault though as amazon did the packing and shipping. it'd be nice if they maybe put a big don't stack things on top of this box sticker or something on the box so that it didn't get damaged. or bubble wrap remember that stuff?! those airbags just ain't cuttin' it. on the clock itself i love it. i kept it despite the minor denting b/c it has been discontinued by the manufacturer and it's the largest atomic clock i could find that didn't have some ugly antique-ish design. the second hand actually ticks instead of fluidly moving which is a nice touch. it was easy to set up and it's big and easy to read. it reminds of the clocks all over my high school (in a good way). all in all very happy with the actual clock very dissatisfied w/ amazon's shipping and packing of it ",positive
" this clock is great. it's really modern looking and i love the black face. i have this in my kitchen and it looks great. there is a second hand which is invaluable in any kitchen. the fact that it's an atomic clock is super because it means that i never have to reset it for daylight savings time because it resets itself automatically. shortly after you plug in the battery the clock starts setting itself to the atomic clock and that's kind of fun. keeps precise time ",positive

" this clock works great! it automatically picks up the accurate time through radiowave. it did not come with a product manual but easy to figure out. all you have to do is selct your time zone button (pt mt ct and et) and put a new aa battery. i agree with another review which mentioned that this clock is not made for durable construction. as a matter of fact when i picked up the clock from the package a tiny screw came off. it was one of the screws to hold back body panel to the main body. it has not affected to the function as well as the visual part anyway so it may not a big deal. overall this clock is good enough for the price ",positive

" as a low cost metal detector i give this thing five stars. i bought this detector several months back and enjoy it's relative ease of use and it does find what you are searching for (coins rings earings necklaces etc). the other reviews here pretty much wrap it up as a good (affordable!) unit but i wanted to make a few comments from an amateur's point of view: - this detector has of course the discrimination circuitry used to tell the difference between the various metals helping you to avoid digging up junk like soda can pull tabs which are everywhere. it does work pretty good but - i have found that by using the tracker iv discriminator you will most likely be missing some good stuff. i have gone back over discriminated areas again in all metal mode and found some nice stuff that discriminate didn't catch. granted i am no pro but the fact is if you want to get every coin every ring or every cool item of various metals you may want to consider just using all metal mode. i almost exclusively use it now and although i sift through some absolute junk. i have found a bunch of coins necklaces pendants etc that i would have otherwise missed. use the discriminate mode when looking for that gold wedding ring your wife through at you in the back yard... - invest in the 4 inch gold nugget coil which is far superior at pinpointing metal. the stock coil works fine but is a tad ambiguous as to precisely where your coin ring (or pull tab) is. the smaller coil reduces search time and i am glad i have one. - i bought the recommended bounty hunter headphones (to save battery power) but have found them to be a bit more trouble than help. when i detect something i squat or sit down and dig. i set the detector down so the coil is near the dig zone so i can waive clumps of dirt (or sand) in front of the coil as i search. the problem is the headphone's wire tends to be always in the way when i perform this move. i get tired of untangling so i don't use them anymore. maybe i'm just getting old. - the meter is of no value for anyone who can hear the audible report. it has no range to judge metals you are passing over. it simply swings hard to the right no matter what from what i can tell. i have tried different modes and different metals to test it but it seems to merely swing hard to the right as you pass over any type of metal / alloy. i can see how this would still be useful to a deaf person but it just as easily could have been a bright light bulb instead of a meter. i won't ding this low cost detector for that though because i'd still dig if it was half scale or pegged. - and lastly a warning. if you go into a park or any area attended by kids you will be spotted. within a short amount of time you will be surrounded by kids helping you to dig up buried treasure. at that point you have to decide whether to be a meanie and bark at them or write the rest of the hunt off and let them shred the area every time the detector beeps. i generally tell them how it's been a long day and see ya since they will invariably have their hands in there digging away no matter what you say... ",positive
" i bought this as a complete novice to the sport?? of metal detecting. i bought it with the intention of locating a few property stakes and maybe finding some valuable treasures in my yard. to date i have found neither. i would chalk this up to my inexperiece and to the fact that i have not gotten out and used it nearly as much as i imagined i would. everything i have read about this particular detector indicated it was an introductory model that works reasonably well. i would agree ",positive

" i picked one of these up several months back and have been very satisfied with its performance.... the coil is waterproof and can be used in shallow water wet soil or sand which makes this a great beach detector. it's okay and recommended to drag the coil along the ground back and forth slowly for maximum depth. it runs on only 2 9-volt batteries which by using headphones you can really extend the life of. while it doesn't have any visual target windows like more expensive detectors the two-tone audio speaker is the key to determining what kind of metal you've found. you can literally turn this thing on and go! there's only 2 dials of operation to worry about all metal (a 10 o'clock setting is good) and it can be used in concert with the discrimination dial (11 o'clock is good here) to eliminate iron and other junk metals. it's simple enough for a child to use and understand.... to save the prospective buyer some trouble read the manual carefully and practice around your house and yard before taking this into the field --- trust me. this is an ideal first detector for someone who isn't sure they'll like this hobby and don't want to spend lots of money to find out. bounty hunter also offers a 5-year limited warranty which shows you that they really stand behind their product. research is the key to making good finds though so don't expect great results without it! read and learn all you can about your local area's history to improve your odds of success. metal detecting has something big in common with real estate --- location location location is the key!

" i've been using metal detectors for around 5 years now. my first detector was a bounty hunter quickdraw ii a very fine easy to learn detector that's a real workhorse. i learned most everything i know about metal detecting from personal experience and from reading lots of posts and asking lots of questions at the bounty hunter forum http://www.detecting.com i shopped around and found the bounty hunter land ranger as a factory shipped model (no extras except 4 and 8 coil) for $337. for that price i couldn't afford not to buy it! when the land ranger (lr) arrived it was in 3 pieces and extremely easy to assemble. the manual that comes with the lr gives you the basic information you need to get started detecting with the lr but is a bit general when it comes to explaining what each of the functions do. if you just want a turn on and go detector the land ranger may not be for you. if this is the case i would recommend getting an easier to learn detector such as the bounty hunter quickdraw ii or even the bounty hunter tracker iv. should you later decide to get the land ranger your first detector will make an excellent back-up detector and a great detector for a friend or family to use with you. what i would recommend is going to the bounty hunter forum website listed above to learn way more information about various detectors and their various functions than i could ever begin to explain here. even though i had been detecting for a while my first trip out with the land ranger was quite overwhelming and somewhat frustrating due to the much greater sensitivity of this model the added features it has and an the information overload of tones responding to mineralized ground conditions trashy areas (many pulltabs screwcaps etc.) and a condition know as falsing (tones due mostly to incorrect sensitivity settings and improper ground balancing). the initial experience that i describe here is very common with first time land ranger users and is frustrating but will get much better with practice and with the more one learns about detecting in general and about the land ranger in particular. as i use the land ranger now i have learned much about settings what to ignore and what to watch for to indicate which targets may be worth digging. once past the information overload (that will happen i assure you) the user will begin to appreciate the sensitivity of this detector learn the proper settings begin finding more and more valuable items (or targets as they are called) and become one with this detector. i purchased the bounty hunter land ranger for it's very sophisticated microprocessor features including - target id vdi (numeric) readout indicating target conductivity 3 tone id it's automatic & manual ground balancing programmable target accept/ reject all metals no motion/ pinpoint mode self tuning (motion) all metals mode (good for deep hunting of relics caches and/or gold nugget shooting) ... and ... for the reputation of bounty hunter detectors ... but mainly for the excellent price of such a full featured professional metal detector. i love being able to put this baby to work discriminating out trash items while ringing in sharp and clear when locating coins and jewelry. the land ranger is also ideal for hunting relics and for (gold) nugget shooting although i have not done much of either of these yet (soon i hope). i also love the fact that two coils (standard 8 and 4 nugget coil) come stock with the land ranger and i also have a 10 coil that i purchased for around $60. (it's important to have several coil sizes available for various types of hunting) the price of additional coils for many other brands of detectors is astronomical so this was an integral part of my decision to get a bounty hunter rather than some other brands. i love how lightweight this detector is. i love knowing that i have a sophisticated detector that will not miss items that are buried deep. (how deep depends on the size of object type of metal soil conditions etc) generally the lr will detect to a depth of around 10-12 deep for a coin sized target. (believe me you won't want to dig too many objects that deep most targets are right around 4-6 deep due to how coins jewelry etc. tend to migrate down into the soil this varies of course but in general a greater number of objects are somewhere in this depth range. what i hate about the land ranger is that parts of the manual give a very general description of certain features like the ground monitor meter or self tuning all metals mode. i wish that the land ranger were waterproof or at least water resistant ... it is not and i highly recommend that you do not use it in the rain without a good plastic cover that fits securely around the control housing. in conclusion: i highly recommend the land ranger for any seasoned detectorist ... or for a novice detectorist that is willing to devote a good deal of time and a fair amount of patience to mastering the many nuances of this full featured detector. the land ranger hosts target id (vdi) numeric readout 3 tone id depth meter battery meter ground monitor meter sensitivity meter and target indicator. it has touchpad controls for sensitivity accept/ reject discrimination all metals - no motion/ pinpoint mode 3 factory preset modes all metals (motion) self tuning mode and for smart trac automatic and manual ground balancing. it's a handful but a great full featured unit for a very reasonable price. 5 stars ... highly recommended if you are willing to devote some time and patience in learning it's traits and harnessing it's potential once you do you'll absolutely love it i know i do! recommended yes ",positive

" first off the picture is all wrong. the tools are just like the ones in the mr. bar-b-q 5-piece oval stainless handle tool set except you also get the plastic case scraper 8 corn holders and 4 knives not the wooden ones shown in the picture. it comes with the xxxl spatula and tongs. i mean these thing are huge in every sense of the word. its a nice set for the price. i would have like a smaller spatula and tongs like the ones shown they are almost too big but i am sure this will last a long time the tools look quite durable. good buy but just be aware what you are actually buying ",positive

" i ordered one but would like to know if on the last review if that is salt water or fresh and what kind of luck and on the other update on further finds as for the other review just find google and type in bounty hunter and the name of the detector and you'll find all of that then knock it down to the best buy and or support which ever is important to you i bought a detector when i was 13 by picking strawberries all summer i am 30+ years past that and i had a blast until i sat on it :&lt; i want that fun back! i know im kinda turning this into a blog but its important for things left unsaid and more helpful for those checking it out for the first time ",positive
" bought this as an open box. what a great detector for the money. i had it out of the box and up and running in 5 mins. very easy setup!! took it to the back yard and found 3 pennies in the first 10 mins (one was a wheat penny). the lcd correctly displayed them as a pennies. as this was my first time detecting the unit seems very easy to use. an excellent choice for those wanting a feature filled detector at a bargin price ",positive

" i was really pleased with the quality of this patio table. it was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering. as others have commented the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table i ordered. i had to buy additional screws at home depot four in total. the missing instructions for the table ordered were not really needed it was simple enough to put together without instructions. all tools needed were included with the shipment. had i not needed to purchase additional screws i would have given this product 5 stars ",positive
" this is a very nice looking and sturdy table. a nice extra is they ship a small bottle of touch-up paint with the product. the table may look nice now but getting there was a pain in the neck. on the positive side - it is very well packaged. no worries about any damage during transport - not a small issue for many items. that said the instruction sheet included was for a different (rectangular) table with completely different legs. even if it was for the same table it was in that hard-to-understand translated-into-english-using-a-dictionary vocabulary. there was a nicely vacuum packed card with all of the bolts and washers as well as an appropriate wrench that fit the bolts. unfortunately there were 12 bolts in two sizes and 12 washers - but 16 holes waiting for bolts in the table. all of the bolts were too long for any of the holes - even with the washers. i ended up getting a bunch of extra washers and few shorter bolts at my local hardware store (if you need to do this make sure you get stainless steel so rust will not be a problem). the bolts provided required between 3 and 4 washers each before they could be adequately tightened. whew - finally done. the table is serving us well on the patio. it replaces a glass topped model which flipped over and shatterred in a big wind last fall. the open weave design is nice - very easy to clean the top. give me a couple of months to get over the trauma of assembly and i might give it 5 stars ",positive

" i have had this for 1 month now and i love it. it does record the outdoor and indoor temp. you can change the display to either show both or only indoor with an expanded clock. we had owned another la crosse clock that is beamed onto the ceiling at night (also great!) and we did not have to set up another outdoor senser. both clocks work off of the one to display the outdoor temp. never have to worry about being late because of a clock loosing time. it is updated every 24 hours. i love it ",positive
" i got this burner for home brewing beer at the recommendation of one of the homebrew forums i read regularly. the box arrived in a little bit rough shape but everything worked great. very easy to use just hook up to a propane tank similar to the way you hook up a gas grill. it generates a lot of heat! this is a mixed blessing as it gets a good boil going but i found it a little bit difficult to control the heat (getting it to slow down enough to not over boil). for my own use i run it with the lowest amount of air/gas available (lowest flame) but if you are in need of serious heat or doing some serious outdoor cooking this burner does the job! pros: lot of flame easy to use easy to setup. cons: little difficult to control the heat as the lowest setting still runs a bit hot ",positive
" this is truly a high pressure very hot burner; the amount of heat that this is capable of producing is nothing short of amazing. if you want to heat or boil a large quantity of water or frying oil it is too hot for small pots this burner will do the job. ",positive
" this remote temperature sensor works in conjunction with the base unit and permits you to monitor the outdoor temp and humidity as well as the indoor temp anywhere in your house. i keep the base unit in my bedroom and can then tell both the outdoor temp and the lower level indoor temps when getting dressed for the day. i think the system works very well for a reasonable cost ",positive
" fairly accurate but not precise. also a replacement unit costs more than a completely new system. oregon scientific has a very strange pricing model ",positive
" i've used this along with the base station for one year now. i've monitored temp and humidity inside outside and in my rv parked in my driveway. works great. easy to use easy to change the batteries. despite the instructions you can use rechargable batteries. they read low on the display but work just fine. ",positive
" besides that outdoor temperature and relative humidity i use the base station inside along with three remote wireless monitors to measure temperature and humidty in my crawlspace attic and outdoors to monitor possible water intrusion issues and if there are freezing temperature concerns for the pipes during cold weather periods ",positive
" we already have the base unit for this product and have previously added another sensor which worked so well that we have now added a third sensor. in addition we have bought the base unit as gifts and have now bought additional sensors for those that we bought the base unit for. we like to be able to check the temperature in our motorhome especially during the winter as well as the garage attic etc. my husband moves the sensors to other locations from time to time and has been very impressed with the whole system ",positive
" i have two of theseone in my bedroom and one outside. they work great. i also have one simular to this one except it has a 4 ft external temp sensing wire that can be used for a pool or freezer. i use mine in a freezer in my shed 150 ft away. all three send a signal back to a small base unit in my living room that i monitor daily. i lost power to my shed last week. if not for the temp sensor in the freezer reading 20 degrees i probably would have had a lot of food spoil. if these sensors ever go bad i will get new units.

" i did a lot of research and if you follow directions it is safe and fun. it takes about 25 min to heat the oil and 45 minutes to cook an 11 lb. turkey. the pot has a maximum oil level mark and that was the correct amount for our bird. the turkey must be dried well to prevent spattering. watch the oil temp. so it does not go over 350. do it outdoors as the paint has to burn off the burners and it smells.

" i gave this grill thermometer to my dad for father's day. it works perfect when he wants to sear fish and steaks too. it's easy to remove from the grill too. i would recommend this item to anyone who does a lot of searing or wants to know the surface temperature of their grill. you can use this for a griddle or an indoor grill on your stove too. ",positive
" i've had this unit for almost 3 years. it works great. i installed it per manufacturers recommendations. i was careful with it to not damage it. the software is great for communication via internet. i have found the measurements to be very accurate. i would buy this again. i'm sure the competition has nice units too. but i really like how this one works. the rain guage works great. what i'd really like is a snow guage ",positive
" i have had the ws-2310 for 3 months and i must say that it has been a pleasure to use. for what you get it's an excellent value - and i have found it reliable and a joy to use. that said i echo the comments about the wireless features and installed my unit as a wired system. i wanted to avoid having to change batteries on sensors mounted in difficult to reach areas. i also found out that the system particularly the rain sensor is rf sensitive. as a ham radio operator i found a 10 watt 2m transmitter 15 feet away caused errant readings. to solve this i did two things i moved the 2m antenna and i added several wraps on ferrite cores for the telephone cables that connect the sensors and the main unit. after reading the documentation on the heavy weather software supplied with the unit i decided i was looking for a more complete package and purchased weather display. this interfaced perfectly with my ws-2310 and has resulted in a reliable and accurate system. you can see my weather system online at http://bwusa.homeip.net:14501/info.html. i also feed data to weatherunderground and other systems. in all there is no doubt that there are more rugged systems available but they are far more expensive which would have made my project impossible ",positive

" i wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. i mounted it on my kitchen window under an awning on the northeast side of the house not at all expecting anything to happen. a ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day! it took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. in fact i had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! fortunately nothing broke. i probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily. you can't beat glass. i'm just totally getting away from plastic these days... ",positive
" i have been buying plastic hummingbird feeders that attach to the window so i can have an up-close view of my favorite birds. i found this wonderful glass feeder that will not deteriorate and get brittle (i had to replace the plastic ones every year). i was concerned that it would be too heavy but the suction cups are very effective and the feeder was accepted immediately by all the hummingbirds. right now there is snow on the ground temperatures below freezing at night and i still have a faithful hummer visiting every day when it gets warm enough for him (her?) to move around. great product ",positive
" my sister gave this to me at christmas and i kept it out on the counter all winter in hopes of an early spring!!! i put all my feeders out the first of may and seen my first hummer the 2nd...hope they will find this one on my window...they are so neat to sit and watch. make your own nectar to use in your feeder...i use a funnel works great to fill feeders ",positive

" this is a nice addition to anyone's patio. the product came very well packaged in heavy duty double boxes with the legs wrapped in padded paper. assembly took around 30 minutes. as others have commented the holes don't line up naturally and did require some finessing in order to get lined up but really wasn't that difficult to overcome. all that is required for assembly is a 4mm allen wrench which is provided (although the end started to get worn 1/2 way through the assembly and required me to use another wrench). probably one of the nicest features of the table are adjustable levelers on the legs. this seems like a good quality that i am confident will last for many years to come ",positive

" an amazing little grill. with 8 charcoal briquettes i cooked a couple of salmon-burgers on it for lunch then put on two cornish game hens put on the cover let them bake for an hour and had them later for dinner. note: don't peak under the lid when using this grill as an oven. the heat escapes and it takes awhile to build it back up. instead use your nose & ears. an excellent little grill for camping picnics and emergencies. since it uses so little fuel you can do a great deal of cooking with a single bag of charcoal. don't use lighter fluid use a small starter stick to start the coals.

" i have purchased lentek bite shield because it is the only product i was able to find that works on the same principle as european mosquito repellents i am used to. i needed it for my daughter's bedroom so i couldn't use any type of candles for the safety reasons and i didn't want to use anything that rubbs directly on the skin since she has extremely sensitive skin. lentek bite shild seems to work pretty well she got bitten only once - the night i forgot to turn it on. now i plan to buy the adapter to plug it in the outlet. that way i would be sure that the batteries wouldn't die in the middle of the night. ",positive
" i am amazed. my mom sent this to me after i'd complained about already being eaten alive by mosquitos this year. i don't just get bites; i get huge oddly shaped so-itchy-they're-almost-painful welts. and i am that person who attracts every single biting insect. i have often wished that i sweated deet. however i don't. i tried this dubiously first in the morning--i'd been getting bites every day between 8 and 10am (even with high % deet). --no bites.-- i still didn't believe it. i used it again that evening--after a rainstorm had come through--from about 6pm to 10pm. no bites! it comes with a belt clip but i left it outside at one point when i came inside. the second i left its side a mosquito landed on me. i have since then used it several more times no insect spray at all and it's been very muggy around here. absolutely no bites. i have seen a couple more bees than usual and it turns out that the ingredient this blows out (geraniol) is said to attract bees. not a big deal to me. it apparently doesn't work for everyone. i have always assumed that there is some sort of chemical i give off that makes mosquitos head straight for me bypassing everyone else. (i might be at a party where no one else even sees a mosquito and i leave with over a dozen bites.) i wonder if the geraniol somehow combines with whatever it is that i put out and neutralizes it. this could explain why it would work for some people and not other people. at this price it's worth it to find out if you are one of the people for whom it might work! i figure if i replace the cartridge every 2 weeks (~$3.50/cartridge) i will even be saving money because i'd been going through 1-2 cans of high-deet bug spray per week ",positive
" we received one of these with our new skeeter beater. i didn't know why there were no gnats or mosquitos buzzing around my head and in my face as there always are... yet no bugs were in the tray of this large skeeter machine. i thought that it was repelling instead of killing the gnats and mosquitos. well after a couple of days my husband remembered that we received this little gizmo and he had forgotten that he turned it on and left it running in the screen house. this little thing was apparantly repelling the bugs away from the large skeeter unit! it was sitting approximately 15' away. those gnats flying in your face and eyes constantly can drive you mad and they were there all day every day...what a nightmare! now even in the evening no mosquitos! what the heck is in this thing? it works without dangerous chemicals???? this is absolutely the best repeller i have ever used and i have tried them all. we live in a large wooded area surrounded by ponds lakes and swamps. we are amazed at this item and will be buying more. psyche!!! no bugs!!! ",positive
" ok i just got one of these things and i have to admit that last evening i stood by our seasonal stream watching the mosquitoes laying eggs on the water and the mosquitoes weren't noticing me a bit. i do have a big lentek mosquito trap which has been helping quite a bit with the populations but really they should have been driving me nuts. now i haven't yet used up a cartridge so i don't know which one is inaccurate but the online advertising copied here and a zillion other places says each cartridge lasts at least 120 hours. however the product package says they last up to 12 hours. big difference! i've emailed the company and will be quite interested to learn which is the actual specification ",positive
" my 7 yr. old son is allergic to mosquito bites plus i'm concerned about west nile virus. unfortunately mosquitoes love him and he always get some really nasty bites when he is sleeping. i bought this little unit and now have peace of mind! i turn this on in his room for about half an hour at bedtime leaving his door open then turn it off and close his door. any mosquitoes lurking in his room have been driven out by the geranium scent. i do the same in my own bedroom and i am very pleased with the results. the geranium scent is rather strong but not unpleasant. i don't find it necessary to leave this on all night so it's not a problem. i also like that you can clip this on your belt and turn it on for when you are outside. it's just a tiny little fan blowing through the geranium scented cartridge so it is small and light-weight ",positive
" when the time zone change happened earlier this year the clock worked like a champ and adjusted accordingly with the atomic clock. the outdoor thermometer seems to give good temperature readings. however i would never ever rely on the barometer to tell me if it's cloudy or sunny. it's often wrong. i also like the light projected readings of the clock. it's too bad that you can't set the clock itself to be readable in the dark which i prefer sometimes over the projection ",positive
" we absolutely love it. it is truly amazing. we only wish we had this clock a long time ago. we have missed out on a lot of fun and convenience. we have enjoyed this instrument so much that we ordered six more for each one of our children. they have all reported back on how much they love theirs as well ",positive
" i have owned one for the past 4 years (haven't turned it off since the day i bought it) and it's still projecting strong as ever. i bought one for my friend for christmas also and he loves it just as much as i do ",positive
" i recently purchased this clock for our bedroom and it has been one of my favorites purchases. i can read the clock during the day and night with no problem and the atomic clock set up within 2 minutes it was so easy. i also like having the temputure show up. i would recommend this to everyone looking for a projection clock. ",positive
" i read all of these reviews and searched the internet to find the best possible projection clock. this is it ! are you nearsighted ? this clock is perfect for those of you like myself that do not see well without their contacts. i just couldn't believe how easy it was to read the temp and time the first night on the ceiling. and my wife who hates to have any light on - is not bothered by this at all...and loves being able to wake up in the middle of the night and check the time on the ceiling. don't forget that the outside temp is on the ceiling as well - so you instantly know how warm or cold it is. you can mount this handheld remote temp sensor anywhere outside - and it sends the temp via radio signal back to the unit in your bedroom. it is amazingly easy to set up - and the weather forecaster works like a charm. i just can't say enough good things. this is a well made clock that serves many purposes and is super easy to use. i am planning on getting my mom one as well ( who is 70 plus ). once you try this - you will never want another clock. it's that good ! ",positive
" i bought this item as a gift for my dad. i was unable to get the atomic clock to self set but we live just outside of a large city and i've heard this can cause some issues . . . in any event my dad loves the crescendo alarm feature (as he gets up at 4:30 am) and the projection feature. everything else works fine and i would recommend this item. perhaps if i played with the atomic clock a bit more i could get it to self set . . .

" this is a great watch for people who are trying their hand at outdoor sports. it is easy to use and not too bulky. wish is was made of a more durable material other than plastic but like i mentioned it is great for a beginner to practice. it has all of the main functions of watches costing much more so it does the job. it is a very clean and smart looking watch ",positive
" great value - sure case could be metal instead of polymer but for the price the capabilities of the watch can't be beat...very intuitive interface and easy to use...compares favorably to watches costing 3-4 times as much.. ",positive
" it's a good watch i'm happy with it it does the job the altimeter is not that accurate but that's the case with almost all the barometric altimeters if u don't mind putting in the correct altitude once in an wile is ok the rest is a o k ",positive
" i use this watch for business trip all over the world the function is very nice the compasstemperatureweather forecast functions are very useful especially the baro-chart is very important to assist to judge the correct weather forecast. the color is very nice but someone mentioned it would discolor i think it should be but not happen yet because it always staid in a very good condition (only business trip) but if i go mountain-climbing i suppose it might happen soon. then why i did not give the 5 stars the only disadvantage is the dual time mode to show local and home town time in a same display is very very important during business trip it can tell when i should call back to my company and the display still has enough space to display the home town time i think la crosse should consider to improve this function. anyway this is still a useful watch for business trip ",positive
" saw this on a hgtv hot grills show and knew instantly we needed it. arrives nicely packaged perfect for gift giving. materials are nice - belt seems sturdy is very adjustable (once you read the instructions - part of the belt is hidden under a velcro flap) and the tools are high quality. lots of extra pockets for adding in your own stuff - a can of beer won't fit the pockets but a bottle will. a lot of the past grilling sets we've bought are cute but flimsy not dishwasher safe or made of too much plastic so they melt on the grill. these are metal with rubber in just the right places and went through their first dishwasher cycle just fine. seemed a little expensive when i saw it online but now that it's home it seems like a good value. it'll pay for itself if we stop using (and leaving) our expensive indoor-only knives and tongs outside! ",positive
" everyone who walks in to my room where i have this clock sitting comments on and wants to know where i got it. this is one of my favorite things. ",positive
" i bought this to monitor the evening outdoor temperature. when it finally cools off enough outside i turn the air conditioner off and run just the fan on fresh air. this was simple to set up and seems to work flawlessly. i like that a change in temperature registers very quickly in tenths of a degree ",positive
" this does what you want it to. accurately tells the temp indoor and outside and refreshes itself about every 30 seconds. what more could you ask for? theres also a blue backlight so you can press any button during the nightime. it also functions as a clock with an alarm but i dont use it. ",positive
" so far the device has entirely lived up to expectations. atomic clock feature works fine and the range and accuracy on the remote sensor seems fair enough -- there is often about a 1-2 degree difference between the sensor and main unit if set right next to each other but this is minor for the uses we get out of it (a quick look at outside temps during the winter). the only issue we ran into that was problematic was the ice alarm feature. this feature sets off the devices alarm anytime the temperature drops between 32 and 27 degrees or so to alert you to possible icy conditions. the problem is that in cold climates the temperature hovers in that range all winter long...so the alarm goes off continually every 40 seconds or so. we just happened upon a solution that has worked perfectly. the ice alarm only works on channel 1. so if you set the outside sensor to channel 2 or 3 the ice alarm is disabled and is no longer triggered. obviously they should have an ability to shut it off but this is it...and even this isn't listed in the instructions ",positive
" i never know what to get my mother-in-law for her birthday. my husband mentioned that she had a lot of hummmingbirds around her house so i got her this feeder. she told me that all the hummingbirds now go to this feeder and not the others. she was very pleased with it which made me very happy. she's a great mother-in-law ",positive
" i bought this feeder about a week ago after spotting a hummingbird in my backyard. it looks great in the yard and i love the detail in the hanger. (it's nothing fancy but it is sweet.) i used the clear hummingbird formula and hung it in an area that didn't get a lot of people traffic but was in clear view. then i waited... for three days there was nothing...then finally last night while sitting outside my husband and i saw 3 different hummingbirds sipping from the feeder!! i was so excited i immediately informed him (to his own distress) that our yard would be filled with feeders before long. :) i think it is a great buy and the hummingbirds really seem to like it. i may consider one with a perch but i must say that it is truly exciting watching them hover then dart away. enjoy ",positive
" this is the only feeder that attracts hummingbirds to our door. we had birds eating right at the glass slider on the front deck all summer long! the birds loved it and my family did too ",positive
