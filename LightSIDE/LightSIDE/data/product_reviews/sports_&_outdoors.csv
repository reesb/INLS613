" billy is great full of energy and enthusiam. i get great results from his workout much better than any other instructor. my family get great results from his workout. his customer service rep were helpful. however i strongly strongly recommend ordering your taebo products through amazon. i've been doing business with amazon many years and have placed over 150 orders. i never never once had any problems with my orders at amazon. when i had questions it's amazing at not only how quick amazon will reply but will give a long thorough and kind explanation. because they reply within a day and take so much time with the response it shows they truly care for you and want to give you the best service possible. i've never found customer service of this very high and rare quality. in november of 2005 after ordering the billy bands from the official billy bank's website. i was sent a package without my permission from the company that contained billy's energy formula supplements. it was a 14 day delayed bill for 31.85. i was upset this was sent without me knowing but here's the worse part. i contacted customer service a gentleman told me don't worry you haven't been billed just send us back the package and we'll credit you $5 into your account for the shipping packaging and mailing cost you pay out of your own pocket to have the items sent back. within a few days i send the product i never requested back. twice by phone and once by email from 3 different cust rep i was told i would receive a $5 credit to my bank account within 7 to 10 days. i was already upset about this matter but it wasn't that big of a concern. however about 2 weeks well over 10 days i never received the $5 credit to my account. but there was a charge taken from their company without my permisson or authorization from my own personal bank account for $8.97 . a few days later the $8.97 was put back into my account. when i contacted the company this is their reply: thank you for your recent e-mail. we apologize for the inconvenience. our records show that your vitamin shipment was on a 14 day delay billing cycle (i sent the item i never wanted back in 7 days not over the 14 day limit). this means that when the charges actually went through you were only charged for a small portion of the amount that showed on the invoice (i kept the copy and nowhere on the invoice is this stated). you received a credit for the shipping and handling plus 5.00 dollars to ship it back too. this means when the charge for the vitamins actually went through you were only charged for 8.97. this is also the refund that you have received the amount paid (again since the item was sent back within 14 days i shouldn't have been charged and nowhere on the invoice is this stated that i would only be charged a small portion). so basically they sent me a product i never requested. told me they would give me some money to have the product sent back. took money from my bank account without me knowing and paid me back with my own money they stolen. to sum it up do business with amazon!

" rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family's emergency kit (and ecologically smart to boot). while this product is satisfactory for say a science demonsration on the faraday principle its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited. to its credit: this flashlight was meant to last and will stand extremes of water and temperature. when dropped into water it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval. it's so sturdy tha it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you can't say that about too many products. shake this light for a while and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time. while you may read claims of up to one or two hours a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes and then you shake again. and again. as long as you don't mind the repetition the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency. but don't entertain thoughts that you'll be able to read find small objects or perform any kind of detail work. if you don't have a chance to compare this to its better competition you might not know that say the sherpa xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by. while no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you'll find in a traditional flashlight your options are brighter if you stay away from the diamond gen. invest in something more powerful and you'll find that a flashlight's usefulness becomes considerably greater. this flashlight was disappointing and useless in any practical context ",negative

" rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family's emergency kit (and ecologically smart to boot). while this product is satisfactory for say a science demonsration on the faraday principle its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited. to its credit: this flashlight was meant to last and will stand extremes of water and temperature. when dropped into water it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval. it's so sturdy tha it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you can't say that about too many products. shake this light for a while and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time. while you may read claims of up to one or two hours a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes and then you shake again. and again. as long as you don't mind the repetition the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency. but don't entertain thoughts that you'll be able to read find small objects or perform any kind of detail work. if you don't have a chance to compare this to its better competition you might not know that say the sherpa xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by. while no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you'll find in a traditional flashlight your options are brighter if you stay away from the diamond gen. invest in something more powerful and you'll find that a flashlight's usefulness becomes considerably greater. this flashlight was disappointing and useless in any practical context ",negative
" 9 of 9 people found the following review helpful: everlife is littlelight november 22 2005 reviewer: agnazzo (tampa florida united states) - see all my reviews living in florida i bought two of these everlife flashlights. the party that said that these flashlights are charged up during shipping is suffering from shaking of the head. it takes at least a minute of shaking after delivery before the flashlight is giving out its maximum amount of light which is very low. after that to keep it operating more shaking is in order. the illumination which is very low compared to other battery flashights dies out very rapidly and need additional shaking to keep it going. this flashlihgt to be fair may come in handy during a hurricane power failure. led flashlights that use batteries are far superior to these shaking flashlights.the batteries last a very long time due to the low power that leds operate at ",negative

" if you just like the cruiser look and will use the bike only occasionally for very short rides (less than 10 miles) then this is probably not a bad bike. but if you want a much more comfortable and efficient bike and one that will fit your body properly go to your local bike shop and ask to see their hybrid bikes. this type of bike gets its name from being a cross between a road bike and a mountain bike or all terrain bike. they are available in several frame sizes so you're not stuck with one-size-fits-all which is not good if you are shorter than about 5'7 or taller than about 5'10. hybrids are available in a wide range of prices and equipment selections. the price will range from just over $200 to as high as you want to go (over $1500 anyway). as the price goes up the weight generally goes down and the quality of the frame and all components goes way up. but even at the low end of the scale a hybrid will be a much more efficient bike to ride (more miles covered per energy expended) and it will be more comfortable on longer rides (over 10 miles). if you are truly interested in covering some longer distances (up to maybe 30-40 miles) focus on the models that feature 700c wheels as opposed to 26-inch--your bike shop person can explain--and keep the tire width down to 35mm or under (28mm is a good size for most people if they ride only on pavement). the narrower tires offer less rolling resistance making the bike easier to pedal and the larger wheel sizes improves efficiency a little also. happy peddaling a very experienced cyclis ",negative

" let me first say that i did not purchase this mini stepper through amazon but rather directly from the discovery channel store. two weeks after i submitted my review of their product on their web site however they still have not seen fit to post it. i used the discovery electronic mini stepper daily for 29 days (30 minutes per day) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke. this seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment judging by previous reviews on the dcs (discover channel store) web site. being inside the 30 day return window i sent my stepper back for a refund. customer service i must say was excellent...only the product itself was cheap and substandard. on a related note this is the third mini stepper (various brands not all dcs) i have owned in the past year. they have all broken down in one way or another. feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper. take some advice from me when i say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness. that is to say if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes then you may be satisfied with one. however if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine then don't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it trust me. there's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking pulley cables breaking shocks leaking...and i actually broke the frame of one stepper. through all of this i have learned one important lesson about exercise: keep it simple. i am now having great success with some simple resistance bands (many varieties are available here at amazon) and cardiovascular exercises (e.g. regular old jumping-jacks). i get a better workout than any i ever got from a mini stepper and i'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places :-) honestly if you want to save yourself some grief please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction. just buy yourself some resistance bands maybe a jump rope an exercise mat an instructional video/book and then get to work. exercising to tone your body and lose weight isn't easy (and if it is then you're probably not doing it right) but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this ",negative
" for all of the supposed 'resistance' built into this machine it enables you to do many -more- repetitions than you'd be able to do of simple bodyweight 'core' exercises(crunches leg lifts situps and a multitude of others). why is that and what is the effect? 1/ why : the resistance is -less- than the resistance supplied by the weight of your own body being moved around without any equipment. the so-called 'resistance' actually -assists- you on the return motion the exact opposite of exercise.2/the effect: you must do an incredibly high number of repetitions do get any effect at all and it won't be much even then. high rep work should be full-body cardio not isolated ab work. ab work should be the same as any other muscle-building work : after you can do 15 reps the resistance should be raised: exercising the abs obliques other core muscles to strengthen and build them. if an exercise doesn't get difficult enough to make you stop after a minute or so it simply isn't difficult enough to do you any good. there is no such thing as spot reducing exercise. modern ads know better than to claim the lie of spot-reduction but they still strongly imply it. why do they get away with it? : because people never stop looking for an easy way out. the re-sale value of these gizmos goes down to around 5 bucks as soon as you own it. why? : because the market is flooded with as-seen-on-tv home-exercise junk that's collecting dust ",negative

" the brunton nexus star is a low-cost fairly rugged basic compass. like any low-cost compass if you know how to use it you can get where you want to go but it lacks features you may later wish you had. on the plus side it is lightweight inexpensive and fairly thin so it doesn't take up a lot of room in your pocket. on the minus side the baseplate is very short so it is harder to use with a map and a little less accurate when reading a bearing. the biggest disadvantage in my opinion is that it doesn't have a true declination adjustment; it is advertised as having a declination scale which is not the same. on a baseplate compass you take a bearing by lining up the compass needle inside the north reference indicator (sometimes called the doghouse) etched on the bottom of the vial. compasses with true declination adjustment allow you to rotate this doghouse to align it with the desired declination. that way you always read a bearing by aligning the needle inside the doghouse. on the nexus star however you can't do this. instead you have to remember to line up the compass needle with the point on the scale that corresponds to the local declination. in this case the needle is not boxed inside the doghouse and i find it can lead to errors especially when you are tired and not thinking clearly after a long hike. if you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings this isn't a problem. i can recommend this compass for use with a gps receiver that is set to read magnetic bearings and it is suitable as a back-up compass. i also regularly use it as an inexpensive tool to teach students in my gps classes how to use a compass but i wouldn't recommend it for serious work ",negative

" this ball is radio controlled with a remote that is about the size of a small cell phone. the ball has two small holes (smaller than the size of a dimple) on opposite sides that connect to a battery operated charger (2 aa). the remote uses a 9v battery. the ball has a small internal battery that apparently can be replaced if needed once it can longer hold a charge. the ball can be operated for a couple of minutes after a charge. the ball is not meant to be hit but probably can withstand a putter hit from a short distance. because of a rolling weight and circuitry within the otherwise hollow ball the ball does not roll straight on its own. the ball looks somewhat like a real ball but has a slightly off-white color and has an obvious seam. when using the remote to control the ball the ball revs up for 2-3 seconds by making a rattling sound then it takes off still rattling away. an arrow on the ball is present to let you know the initial direction the ball will roll. you can reverse the ball's direction but you can't make it go left or right. the two biggest drawbacks of this gag ball are: 1. you can only direct the ball in two directions (front - back) with the remote. 2. a fairly loud rattling noise is made by the ball that probably can be heard from about 20 yards away. as a gag ball it seems like it is of only limited use. but for about $10 what more can i expect ",negative

" my daughter is 38 and about 30lbs. it's the perfect size for her. we mainly use it as something to lay on while watching tv or reading books on the floor. pros - when in the chair position it's tall enough to accommodate taller children. - cover is removeable and washable - comes with handy pink storage bag (although it's kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed) - pretty easy to convert into chair (there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be connected in order to change it into chair - they are color coded). might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it. - inside of sleep bag is made of soft material (although it appears as though it may snag easily). - large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag. easy for small hands to use. - weight limit: 100 lbs cons - the pump is very cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed (it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands). - the air slowly leaks out of the bed. we actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased so we exchanged for another one. but this one too deflates pretty quickly. example: if we completely inflate at 7pm by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40% of it's air. - adult help is needed to change into chair. - adult help is needed to inflate. overall: it's a bit pricey for the quality i was expecting. it would be nice if adult assistance wasn't needed to change from bed to chair and back. defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so ",negative

" ok i really thought this ball would be great considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the nba. not so! this ball feels very similar to the cheap $20 balls you can get at your local department stores! feels similar to the wilson ncaa solution game ball but slightly less tacky but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber. i personally do not like that. this ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box without a break in period. well i hope it gets to feeling better over time but since it supposedly has not break in period i am very skeptical. i honestly do not feel the crosstraxxion design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball. if you like the feel of leather this is not for you. i am not impressed! search for reviews for this ball before purchasing! the only thing you can do with this ball that you can't do with others is say well at least this is the official game ball the pros use!

" field in a bag claims to be the perfect way to get a baseball game going. while this may be true the number of games you can actually play with this set will be one (if the set even makes it through the game). first off with these bases you must set up the field using the wooden mallet the pound a flimsy plastic stake into the ground. with one of my sets (i bought 3 unfortunatly at the same time not knowing their reputation) the wooden mallet wasn't even glued together it had fallen apart so i had to just use the head. then when i put the stakes into the ground out of the 3 sets i had at least 1 in each set broke while i was placing them. to actually place the bases the set gives you a string device that helps you measure out the field. this was handy except for the fact that it took me 10 min to untangle the mess and then when i went to second base realized the string was not long enough. granted one could place 1st and 3rd and then figure out where 2nd went but the picture in the set-up shows that the string will measure the base; however it definintely is not the right length. after placing the bases the team is now ready to play. however don't wear cleats with these bases. the bottom of the base says not recommended for use with cleats and boy were they right! with our game we had tball children using the bases and even their little cleats (and not all the kids had cleats) tore them to shreds. our bases lasted about one hour before they were torn and the inside cotton coming out. it was very unfortunate seeing as though we purchased three sets and all were done by the end of an hour. this non-profit won't see that money again :) so unless you plan on using these bases on the grass for easy set-up do not plan on wearing cleats and not playing a true game of baseball/softball....you would probably be better off buying the $8 flat bases for temporary use (and they can be left outside afterward too). - just not impressed sorr ",negative

" i ordered two of these with high hopes to be utterly disappointed. first the design of the battery holders is bad. they are supposed to hold two c cell batteries. when i tried to get one in i initially concluded that a different size must be requried as it seemed the c size wouldn't fit. after much futzing around i managed to get two c cells in without hopelessly bending the flimsy contact springs. this one now works but i doubt that i could successfully remove and replace the batteries again. the battery holder is too flimsy. on the second unit the contact wire which connects the two far ends of the batteries had fallen out of its plastic holder. after 15 minutes of trying to put it back i gave up. this unit is totally unusable. nothing on the pyramid package label indicates that two batteries c cell size are needed but not included. second this is a fender mount light meaning if you want to mount it to your handlebar there's no way to do that with the hardware included. while the pyramid box does say fender mount that description was not included in the online product description. and this light with batteries installed is fairly heavy. the lightweight plastic fender on my front bike tire would not come close to supporting this light and i doubt that many bike fenders these days would. why would anyone sell this as a bike headlight without including a handlebar mount?? i'm totally disgusted with this flimsy product and with the vendor who sold it to me ",negative

" i am writing this as a review of hippo clubs in general. i purchased a simmilar set from amazon a year ago because it was a $300 set or irons reduced to $100. i was interested in the graphite shafts (all i have ever used is steel) and wanted a cheap set to travel with (i have had 2 different sets of clubs lost during travel). the first thing that i noticed with these clubs was my miss-hits rose dramatically. the clubs looked nice enough but their performance was less than par. when i talked with my club pro he said that the problem with buying graphite shafted clubs that are inexpensive like these hippos is that the shafts are cheap not consistant. your average pro plays with graphite shafts that cost up to $80 each. he also indicated to me that high handicappers tend to buy cheap clubs (which was a humbling fact that i had to swallow) and that high handicappers tend to play better with steel shafts. all of this being said i chalked up my $100 mistake and began looking locally at all of the golf shops for high-quality pre-owned clubs. after 2 weeks i found a hardly used set of '04 big berthas for $359. i talked the salesman down to $299 and walked out with the best set of clubs that i have ever hit. i guess my point is that if you are looking at these clubs you are either a new or relatively unskilled player-- like me. if this is the case take some time and search out high-quality pre-owned or used equipment that will make your learning curve my shorter. let the golfers that get new clubs every two years spend $600-$1000 for new sets. take advantage of their trade-ins. that's my opinion anyway ",negative

" i didn't read in the instructions that i was also buying a dancing partner. this thing just *will not* stay still. i tried putting it on carpet and on wood floors but the water weight just isn't enough to keep it still. power punching causes the base to tip and then slam back to the floor making a terrible racket. if i lived in an apartment my neighbors would hate me. the water ends up around 200lbs (when full) and just doesn't do the trick. i have been thinking of using sand which tops out around 320lbs but not sure how easy it will be to get back out since the only opening is a small opening on top meant for water. as for springiness you can definitely wail on this thing and it can take it (by moving across the floor) but in my opinion it's too springy. there is no comparison to hitting a hanging bag. it definitely needs a tension adjustment. i'd say this bag is probably better for practicing control. i wouldn't suggest this for an apartment if you plan on power-hitting ",negative
" i won't mention about the quality of this product. but this standbag doesn't have enough weight to stand my punch. i filled this with water to the full and when i throw a hook the front part goes up in the air and comes down. am i supposed to fill this up with lead? i'm not bragging. i am below average young males' heights and weights i don't work out never had a boxing training just sometimes visit the gym with sandbags and throw punches when i'm depressed. i can't believe those guys who wrote the reviews are so weak to be satisfied with this stuff. i'm returning this and get a real heavy bag even if it will cost a lot ",negative
" i've had this product about a month purchased from a sporting goods store - at first all was well. unfortunately the bag became shakier and shakier as time progressed. i had to reset the screws (as other reviews for this product have mentioned) - but one screw would not come out. it was stripped. a week later same problem. i tend to hit the bag about 2 hours a day 3 times a week and 1 hour a day the rest of the week. apparently hitting it causes the screws to warp the holes of metal centerpiece which connects the stand & bag to the base. this causes either: a) screws to strip b) the holes to enlarge and warp meaning screws no longer catch. apparently whoever designed this product forgot that a punching bag is made to be struck and hit. today finally the bag got ko'ed because now only two holes in the metal centerpiece out of eight will actually securely catch the screws. i'm a 6'1 220 lb. guy and i'm only using about half of my full force into my punches (again i hit it just about every day) - so in other words this bag is definitely not intended for heavy-duty use. i'll call everlast monday and keep my fingers crossed that the replacement part is made sturdier than the original ",negative

" i purchased this item based on the picture. i didn't want a cheap looking air-hockey table because i planned to keep it for a long time. the price seemed good for the looks of the table even though the shipping was $150. arranging delivery with the carrier was a bit awkward but not too bad but the box itself was clearly abused and showed a general lack of care in handling. i don't know if the abuse was from the carrier delivering it to me or prior carrier but it did have me worried about the condition of the contents. i couldn't see any parts through the holes and tears in the box so i hoped for the best. when i opened the box there was no obvious shipping damage however there was one spot on the surface that could have been caused by improper packaging. the assembly instructions were a poor quality photocopy that cut the top line off most pages. there was a separate sheet of paper instructing me to line up letter tags during assembly however the tags were not properly placed and assembly per the diagram on the sheet would have been impossible. assuming all parts were symmetrical worked just as well. i was also disappointed with the quality of the assembly of the main components. alignment was poor making final assembly difficult and there was excessive adhesive all over the place even on the playing surface. i was able to remove most of the adhesive from the playing surface except for one spot that may have been damage from shipping. the table comes with a 90 warranty on materials and workmanship but doesn't include shipping. as the table surface is the largest component i'm imagining it would cost most of the $150 shipping fee to have it replaced. at this point i'm not willing to sink any more money into this table. after the table was set up i was hoping it would at least play well. i was disappointed there too. there are some plastic guards on the goals that make scoring very difficult. i've never seen anything like them on other tables. by the time you get the puck moving fast enough to evade your opponents blocking of the small opening your shooting for it fly's off the table. in fact you spend more time retrieving the puck than you do playing. maybe this has something to do with the extra adhesive down the sides of the playing surface but it still ruins the game. there were a lot of excited kids when the table arrived. they all played about one game and now the table sits unused. all in all this has been my most disappointing online purchase. i guess there are some things you see first hand before you buy ",negative

" this step sucks. if you are used to doing step classes at the gym you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step. i didn't know it was a smaller step or i wouldn't have bought it. it is hard to adjust to the shorter step especially when doing a turn step or v step. it ends up being very close to a basic step. i was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up that i was cheating myself out of a full workout. do not buy this if you're used to the step at the club. i feel like it's more dangerous on this and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor. if you already know that you like to step buck up and buy the club size step even though it is twice the price of this one. otherwise don't buy anything ",negative
" the way these bags are constructed - or supposed to be - is that they are stuffed with fibers and filled with sand for weight at the bottom - the part you don't punch. i was wondering why it felt like i was punching a brick wall on the left side: that's where they stuck the bags of sand. just what a fighter needs before a fight (or anyone needs at any time of their life) - to be punching compacted bags of crushed rock. this is a clear defect: i am considering returning it. not sure if they're all like this but i assume mine is not unique. can't find where it says it was manufactured but in this day and age and based on the craftsmanship it's reasonable to assume china. hey - at least the cardboard box it came in was made in missouri! mine also suffered a little damage during shipping: the box had a small hole in it and the bag got scuffed. it usually takes years of pounding before this type of damage occurs on it's own. hey it's hit or miss when you order online particularly with oversized items as far as shipping an handling are concerned. the shipping box was damaged and oil stained the product poorly constructed. so i'd call this a miss ",negative

" this gun is a piece of $#!& my bro got it some time ago. he was so excited. it made me glad to see that he was so gung ho about his new airsoft. he loaded it aimed at a 1-foot target not more than 20 feet away sprayed as accurately as possible and guess what happened...? yup out of the 20 in the clip about 5 or 6 hit. not on the bull's eye i can tell you that. the 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast for comfort and the accuracy sucked like mad but my brother's hopes were not dashed yet. (-_-) he filled up the 110-shot mag winded it up aimed and the same thing resulted only this time the spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds. out of maybe 50 shots fired about 12 hit. i checked the gun all around but it was not defective at all except for the part that this gun was made very cheaply. my brother tried it on semi-auto which is usually more accurate. not for this gun though. in fact the semi-auto was even less accurate than the automatic feature!!! out of 10 shots one or two hit! i couldn't tell because this gun's 140 fps made barely a sound when it hit the target! (we were shooting in the dark.) let's not even talk about the red dot scope or the silencer. i only gave it a two because (1) that is the next lowest you can give and (2) this gun's looks is okay. please buy a different gun off ebay or something!!! you can get an m16 with a grenade launcher with 300 fps and 300 mag cap for less than 20 bucks (if you bid correctly)! by the time my brother had finished playing his dopamine levels were probably under normal. in simple terms he was disappointed ",negative
" i recieved this gun about a week ago and couldn't wait for it to arrive. it managed to arrive one day early because i live close to it's store in california. when i recieved it i couldn't figure out why i could not mount the scope. it was broken. next i tried to read the instructions which are total crap because they are awfully written. i started to shoot it and every time i wanted to use the larger clip i had to jam it into the socket every time it stopped shooting which was quite often. next i had my sister shoot me with it from about 10 feet away and didn't even feel it when the bb's hit in a t-shirt. plus aftera while of shooting the semi-automatic started to fail and it would only shoot automatic. lastly in it's first cqb the strap fell completely off. here are the main good's and bad's of this gun. good: -relatively cheap -lays down a lot of bb's in a short amount of time. -collapsable stock is nice. -relativly accuracte at close range bad: -clips either tiny or worthless because it won't stay in the gun. -extremely weak -accesories may come broken. -insructions awful. -low battery life. -fire settings jam/don't work p.s i'm not really jacqueline k. schmidt ",negative
" good points of the el-300: powerful sharp beam; long run per battery change; easy on-off quick-mount clamp for anti-theft; and it's a superb flashlight. i like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs so i often borrow it from my bike. this light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes if the beam hits direct from even say 40 away. cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people's eyes. in my estimate it is mostly a terrific flashlight and not a great bike-mounted headlight at least as a stand-alone. trouble is that sharp-focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials: lighting your path (you actually can with this focused power); or alerting others to your presence. that would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic or a tad right or left toward peripheral traffic depending where you are and how the road tracks and where cars are coming from. it's a real attention-getter to oncoming drivers which is great if conditions are all just right: if you focus the lamp near level and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam. however traffic off to the side is another deal since the headlight's peripheral light suffers by contrast. i nearly took a short trip to a long rest as a result. late on a quiet night one flaky guy entering a major broad secondary road i was traveling was coming fast up to his stop-sign on a side street to my right ahead of where i had just rounded a curve. he had a view accross broad lawns on up the dark road behind me. after slowing just a bit he accelerated and ran his stop sign. i was right near his position on his side-street committed pedaling about 15 - 17 mph about to cross his bow. he started his right turn gunning it merging with unseen me. he was totally unaware of me and was clearly of this mindset: no double-car-headlights no car noise so no car so nuttin' coming so good-to-go so -- gun it! ... all in the space of a couple seconds. moving fast with the right-of-way i had the el-300 blazing away bright. only it was focused straight ahead of me and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front. i was dependent on the el-300 to send ahead to the likes of him unavoidable announcing light. it's what i paid for (about $45.00 delivered). i also wore a white helmet had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals. but i know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit when not bathed by headlights and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver's eyes. that's why i own a headlight. it's why now-enlightened nj demands a bike headlight. of course neither does a driver have any merit when s/he rewrites the stopsign law to read no need to stop as long as i don't see anyone coming. he nearly killed me coming fast at me broadside. he had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn still accelerating when he spotted me and panic-braked. we were at one point about 2 feet apart thanks to his hard braking and my veering left on the (luckily deserted) dark main road. i was for a fraction of a second looking down at his headlights and bumper almost below me. could have reached over and touched his hood ornament. incredible experience. it was my closest call ever and scared the hell out of me. it must've scared the hell out of him too. he registered his shock-and-awe with a reproaching after-fact horn blast as he scrambled around and passed me racing off before i could read his plate. i guess it must've ticked him off my scaring him with that close call. one little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile. equally maddening for him after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight and the white helmet and all the reflectors (those alerted him once i was his front-and-center target) he would had to then see that blazing headlight's pencil-beam in his rear-view mirror. damn nuttin' he could blame on this creep on the bike. :-[ the el-300 simply failed me that time as i see it by focusing most of its light in a narrow long-projecting beam. it was focused left of where he was looking when i was very close to the side street he was traveling ignoring his stop-sign. there should from so much light energy be some part diverted wider closer to the bike even if lower intensity. in my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp: 1. the narrow focused beam making you live(??) with the single direction in which you aim the beam. its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light. 2. that is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on both vertically and horizontally. the vertical part is the worse; the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight's balance-point so it's a seesaw that's forward-heavy. lift your bike front tap it down lightly and you've likely refocused the lamp lower as you would not if the mounting were at the balance-point. aim it temporarily right (and tight) and you are seemingly good to go ... but only as far as the first noticeable bump. it then drops a few degrees and you keep correcting it vertically to light either your intended path or the oncoming drivers' windshields. your need is like being at the oscars: you want to both see and be seen only in this case to save your life. i am chasing after another led lamp now which i understand to have a wider (along with brighter) beam. i have respect for cateye in general. their current website page of battery-op headlamps does not offer the el-300.

" i purchased this product from performance bike to replace a much older (10yr) cateye wired computer. i have a certain amount of brand loyalty to cateye because their products are typically of higher quality (almost always manufactured in japan as opposed to china) and typically last a long time like the aforementioned 10-year-old cycle-computer. i purchased this product without much hesitation but was disappointed with the unusually stripped feature set. the cateye vectra is missing two critical functions: ride timing and average speed: features even my 10-year-old velo2 computer has. it offers only current speed max odometer clock and trip distance. the overall quality of the unit is good and i'm sure it will last for years with the solid japanese construction but i'll seek another unit because the missing features make it unusable for my purposes. luckily the sender unit magnetic pickup is reverse and cross compatible with cateye's other wireless computers i.e. it works with my older cateye cordless 2 computer also. bottom line: pick another cateye model and watch the feature set carefully ",negative

" i'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official nfl football from a previous year and i wanted to get another one for backup. i know 'the duke' is supposed to be the official nfl ball from this year but there seems to be something wrong with the balls amazon is shipping. the first ball i got from amazon was hard as a rock slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces. i got a second one and the stitching was a bit better but it was still hard and slippery. and when it was exposed to rain the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring. i have no clue if that's to be expected or not since it's all leather but it seems odd. in any case you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball. so it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe i play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands (which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls). maybe the footballs just need to be broken in but i'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them which no one seems to want to do. i've tried to let some air out to make the things more user-friendly but it doesn't really help. anyway i find it really hard to believe this is the ball the nfl played with this year. something about them just seems cheaply made. in any case i suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball.

" this bobber cooler is definitely a conversation piece. i have had so many comments about it. i used it when floating down a small river near home (no rapids just calm water) it doesn't hold its weight literally. the first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water. the opening seam rides just barely about the water and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water. the cooler then fills up with water which almost immediatly melts the ice and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom. maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better it might be ok. the 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off plus they are facing the wrong direction. if you bump something like a rock or a log it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler. this cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current like a pool but i don't suggest towing it behind anything. i suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market ",negative

" i have an original thighmaster i purchased years ago...thinking this thighmaster gold was going to be similar i purchased it to take to work with me. it is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up. my old thighmaster is very sturdy-i have been using it for years and it looks fairly new. this one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year. save your money ",negative
" first of all i'd like to say how much i loved my thighmaster. i got one four months ago from a sportmart and it has been part of my daily routine ever since. i have much better thigh muscles and a lot more confidence in myself because that little invention made of foam and an industrial strength coil. with that said i have a slightly amusing and mildly alarming anecdote for you. i was just beginning my strength training exercises and i had just done my second rep with the thighmaster and all of the sudden i heard a loud pop and it fell to the ground . . . in two pieces! now there are two things that immediately crossed my mind wow man my thighs must made of steel! and the other more likely scenario wow man it fell apart after four months this must be an inferior product. anyway i e-mailed suzannesommers.com in hopes that it was a fluke and that i had gotten the one crumby thighmaster. i asked them if it was possible to replace it and sadly although i only owned it four months i was told it may be time for a new thigh master as the product is not designed to last forever. last time i checked four months is not anywhere near forever. a year six months maybe but when you divide the cost of a thighmaster by the amount of time i owned it the costs outweighs the benefits. it is even less comforting that the company wasn't surprised or alarmed by their product's short lifespan. it seemed that if four months is akin forever to the people at suzannesomers.com then the product's usage expectancy is not much more than that. it makes me unhappy to have ruined such a handy little device with normal wear and tear but i can't really afford to buy a new one every four months. i just wanted to give everyone a heads up and let you know that although it is theoretically a great product the durability is highly dubious. and the suzannesomers.com who referred me to the manufacturer's warrantee only think that a thighmaster should work for three months maximum.

" does the unit work??...well yes to a degree. it takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. the display is poor and though they say up to 40 objects per hole there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. all this depends upon the skycaddie course recorder. the user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the course recorder didn't think was important. now the bad part. the unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). my button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. when it breaks again...which it will often..the unit will probally hit the dirt. this isn't good. but fear not. it will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with skygolf. and another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). now my replacement broke on the first time i clipped it to the belt. now back to skycaddie to get another. after being on hold for another hour they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. this will take another hour. you then get a message to leave a message. normally within a week someone will call you back. by normally i mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. would i buy another... duh.... no ",negative
" i got this pos for christmas because i was excited by the ad the concept and natalie gulbis. it' a neat idea and i love gadgets. upon removing it from the box it looks and feels cheap like a happy meal toy cell phone. cheap plastic and a poor lcd screen. if that were it i could live with it but i can not get this thing to connect to the website to down load the necessary software. i have been trying all day from different computers and still nothing. i call the support number sit on hold for about fifteen minutes and then it just hangs up on you. this is a fairly expensive toy. you would think skygolf would spens a little less money on advertising and a little more on r& d. this thing is junk. stick with a bushnell 1500 pinseeker instead. traditional rangefinder but it works great. nothing to crash no support needed and it works!!! i am sending this expensive piece of junk back first t hing tomorrow. the sad thing is skygolf is destroying its image and reputation. if they had put a little more effort into their development and actually had someone there to answer the phones this could have been a really nead golf tool that people wouldn't mind paying for. the annual $20 membership fee is no problem if it works. right now i wouldn't pay $20 for the unit its self let alone the membership. don't waste your money on this... well i was going to call it an expensive paper weight but it wouldn't even work for that... it weighs about as much as a sheet of card stock.

" i saw this ad on tv today and about to purchased from here at amazon instead of zone pilates' web site. i kept reading reviews and one reviewer (evelyn from fl) mentined that the ring would not stay on the body. actually i was thinking the same. i was about to purchase and saw s/h fees (about $15). also her keep on looking and i did. i found out everlast for her pilates fitness ring with dvd here at amazon for only $14.99 (asin: b00091ryzy ) and bally fitness ring for pilates with dvd $17.99 (asin: b000h3ynr6 ). both are very identical to this zone pilates and eligible for free super saver shipping on orders over $25. sorry my review will not be helpful for the seller of this zone pilates but maybe for actual customers like me. ps. i have similar pilates rubber resistant ring and it doesn't stay put on the body especially near the hip. it is good for toning my legs though. i really want the butts from the models of zone's commercial. maybe i can try with everlast ring with half price. update 1/11/07: i received my everlast ring yesterday. the physical ring is very identical to this zone ring but actual workouts are quite different. i really like zone's workouts from commercial (you can also watch again from their website) especially for buns & thights. i wish i can purchase just dvd from zone with low s/h :) update 1/16/07: i'd also purchased this zone pilates from walmart (~$25+7 s/h) and received it yesterday. it was a huge mistake! the ring is very identical to everlast not any better (rather slightly heavier). the accompanied dvd has only 2 workouts and they last only about 10 min. and the second workout is slightly modified from the first one. they were not as effective as everlast's workout dvd which is more precise and has better menu. the instructor from this zone pilates kim stoneman has flabby belly and sloping buttocks! it seems like she is not using her own ring unless it's not effective as advertised and she proved that! very un-motivating for me! she stands in front of a still camera so we cannot see particular movements from different angle (unlike everlast you can see those). zone pilates advertised with a different model with pretty body but you cannot see her in the workout dvd. don't waste your money to belive the commercial and purchase this zone. i'll return mine to walmart asap ",negative

" i found the size range to be completely missleading. my child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs. she is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat. her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable. the bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be ",negative

" if you search for the keyword 'illuminator led flashlight' you'll find that this same item is offered from varies sources at wildly different prices. so naturally you should just go for the lowest price right? not so fast... i already bought one illuminator flashlight elsewhere (see my customer images' above) and was going to order a few more as gifts. the lowest price i found here is from 'iggfactory handhelditems' at $7.95. but during checkout i found out that their standard shipping and handling fee is $8.21 for just one item. the flashlight itself weights only 7 oz. but the company charges 4 lb. for shipping weight. what a rip-off! with such inflated shipping cost you may be better off buying this item from local drug stores (such as walgreen) for $15. at least there you can return the item easily if you're not happy with it.

" i held high hopes for the product - being that i live in a little apartment in nyc i was looking forward to saving space. the tune-up stand is little/portable however it was not too sturdy. the bike while on the stand will not withstand much torque at all. the bike fell over many times before i gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand. forget about turning the crank the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over. this stand would be good for light work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag. any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike. overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person's bike or a bmx. i used it on a men's road bike size 57.

" this gun is horrible. i bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of $$$. first off it is a 3/4 scale gun so it is very small and very light if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter. also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless. when we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370. also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun. after about 10-15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process. granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time. over all this gun stinks. i bought it when it was originaly 100.00 but the list price was 10.00 so i thought it was going to be decent but i was wrong. spend your money elsewhere!!!!!

" i wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country. this retro designed one speed steel framed coaster braked comfort bike seemed to be the ideal choice. when it arrived i pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it. the first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are not included in the manual (which seems to cover every bike but this one). how hard could it be to write up instructions (with tool specifications)for each model they manufacture? a one page flyer could have done the trick. to further complicate matters some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes. it turned out that i couldn't complete the assembly because i couldn't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment. i had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly. even the bike shop had problems with this bike because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires. i watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand so that it wouldn't rub the tire. when i got the bike home the first thing that i did was to adjust the seat to the correct height and take it out for a ride. within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down. the quick release handle can't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it (i'm not that heavy). chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height. rather than try to dis- assemble this and box it up to return it...i will check to see if i can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height. its too bad they couldn't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment! the points i do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame and tires that will work well for unpaved trails...when i can finally ride this.

" i bought this gloves so i wouldn't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime i went for a bag workout. one reviewer is clearly confused. they said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand. turns out there is no metal bar in it but instead it was plastic or something similar. then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag i wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles. this has never happened to me before and i have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years. yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years. another thing i noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags. they get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them. gave these gloves 2 stars since i liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work. but they need to be greatly improved upon.

" i was attracted to the park & sun pb-pro pitchback pro because of the large dimensions of the tubing and the hinge assembly that would allow me to easily fold the unit and place it in my garage. the first unit i recieved arrived with the box trashed and the netting hing pieces and hardware missing. i promptly recieved a replacement box and it contained everything i needed to assemble the unit. unfortunately the tolerance on the nipples and flanges of the tubing pieces varies considerably. after juggling pieces around and pushing and tugging i ended up with two pieces that should have fit with other pieces but absolutely did not fit any of the pieces. on one vertical piece the nipple was too big and would not fit into any of the flanges; on a corner piece the recieving flange was too small to recieve any of the vertical pieces. also the tubing is made of rolled steel tubing and the weld is not ground off of the interior of the tubing so that virtually all of the pieces are difficult to fit together. the packaging was insufficient as several pieces came with the paint rubbed off with rust showing through due to shifting of the contents. there was rust dust on the plastic sleves covering the tubing particularly at the tube ends. nice idea poor execution.

" my first impression is that the unit is very rugged and nice looking. then i tried to use it. i mostly bought it for the altimeter and thermometer. in the first day of use i just ran out of patience and plan to return it. here's the problems i had with the altitech2 1. most of the time the buttons work fine but several times i pressed the mode button and the mode did not change. 2. when setting declination page 25 of the manual states that you can press set/reset/light to reverse the digits but as soon as you press the set/reset/light button the unit ends the calibration mode. 3. the temperature was stuck at 87.5 degrees for about an hour after purchase. finally after cycling through the mode buttons the temperature instantly dropped to 81.5 degrees. i held the unit in front of the ac vent in the car until the car was cooled down to 70 degrees i suspect the air coming out of the vent was actually cooler than 70 degrees. the temperature display never budged from 81.5 degrees. 4. i constructed a rudimentary chamber and placed the altitech2 unit and a digital thermometer in the chamber. the digital thermometer registered 78 degrees the altitech2 registered 81.4 degrees. i blasted hot air in the chamber with a hair dryer. the digital thermometer quickly rose to 116 degrees and i turned the heat off. the altitech2 stayed at exactly 81.4 degrees. after removing from the chamber the altitech2 slowly increased to 94 degrees went down to 92.6 degrees and stayed there for a good 5 minutes. despite the room temperature being about 78 degrees. 5. the compass will only stay on for 10 seconds then the display turns off to conserve battery. this never seems to be long enough to get a good fix while using in reference to a map. when the display shuts down you need to press the start button again to turn on the display. since this button is recessed you have to reposition your hand to press the button with your fingernail (i had to). this moves the compass in relation to the map again and is very frustrating to have to constantly have to press the start button. i'll stick with my 19th century compass for now. this unit might be worth keeping for me if the altimeter is reliable but after all the other trouble i had i did not even mess with setting up the altimeter as i had lost confidence in the device.

" i tried $50-$60 sets from regent (who apparently also does spalding) franklin and sportcraft and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance including who pays shipping costs). regent and sportcraft had several handles with too few threads inviting breakage. franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened. some sportcraft end caps rolled under and they claimed their 2  balls were 3 (if they were rounding why don't they round their 3 5/16 balls as well?). franklin's stakes had different tapers and about 1/16 different diameters. on the personal preference front sportscraft's handles are grooved franklin's balls are and their wickets are narrow. regent's colors are dull. rated 1 star because sets tend to be priced by the size of the equipment and this is too expensive for mislabeled 2  balls ",negative
" i bought one of the brookstone mini-exercise bikes when it was still priced at $99.00 (on february 1 2007) based on two positive reviews that were posted at that time. initially i was impressed by the prompt delivery of the product but immediately discovered the bike was not factory assembled correctly. instead of a left- and right-hand crank arm my exercise bike has two right hand crank arms. this may seem trivial until you realize that the cranks are suppose to be threaded in opposite directions to prevent the pedals from coming unscrewed during use. i contacted brookstone customer service to request a replacement part (i needed two right-hand pedals) the evening i received the shipment. i had to place follow-up calls each week for six weeks until finally receiving the replacement pedal. when at one point i mentioned simply returning the exercise bike the customer service rep. indicated that approval would be needed from higher up the food chain because--as i waited for the new part--i'd had the bike in my possession past the 30-day return policy! with the new pedal finally in place i immediately tried out the bike and was disappointed (though unfortunately not surprised) that the overall construction feels very flimsy under foot. the mini-bike is quite noisy and so far i've found no floor surface that keeps it reliably stable during use--either on a rug or on linoleum. as a result i have to back it up against a desk file cabinet or bookcase to use. this product has been a huge disappointment and i would strongly encourage people interested in purchasing a small exercise bike to please not waste their money--even at the reduced price--on this product. ",negative
" i was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much i thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything. but when i tried it i discovered 2 things. first off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). and when i finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute. this bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though i only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs ",negative

" i ordered this product for more than what its new price is on december 21 2006 as a christmas present for my mother. it didn't arrive until january 9th and it arrived damaged! we sent it back for a refund. on february 2nd this low-rate item arrived at our doorstep again after i checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a return and not an exchange. we decided to set it up and see if this one was better. still damaged in another area. i have called the sharper image over ten times now over a span of 2 months. i know their customer service number by heart and i even know their direct customer service number (without having to go through the machine) by heart (call 1-888-344-5555 instead of 1-800...). their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow! they've given me 3 different order numbers without telling me so i couldn't get accurate information about my order online. beware of dealing with this company. if you can go into a sharper image store somewhere take the thing out of its box to examine it and only then consider bringing this product into your house. one good thing is that they do give you a full refund tax included. at least that's what they told me by phone today. by the way this should be called a foldaway strider not elliptical. it absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do ",negative
" i am a personal trainer and i was asked by a friend to check this elliptical strider out for them. i was suspicious from the price thinking that it really couldn't be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway. as i suspected this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago. except for the tony little tv glider most of those 20 or more gliders that were on the market are all gone. there is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are no gliders in health clubs. with ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running. this of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past. also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion. i've read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing. but it is a question of time. you could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical. i'm not promoting any one brand and i have no ax to grind except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like sharper image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products. the reason elliptical machines are called elliptical is that the user's foot goes through an elliptical path. gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum. if you don't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist. this is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals. my advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical.

" at first i was very happy with this stroller. i love the big wheels the front one which swivels. the cup holders are convenient for both parent and baby. and the adjustable handle is awesome because i'm short and i can push the stroller at a comfortable height. also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall museum park or on city streets. one of the biggest drawbacks for me has been the reclining seat back. there is a drawstring that you must adjust. this requires two hands and can be difficult at times if the child is fussy or uncooperative. despite this i still loved the stroller until recently. however after only two months of use my stroller will not lock. it has actually folded up on my son while pushing it. i now cannot even seem to lock it into the open position for use. i have not found any levers to snap in place to hold it open. and because the stroller folds outward not inwards like an umbrella stroller it actually pulls the childs body backwards when the locks give out. this is very dangerous. i am contacting the manufacturer about this defect ",negative

" continuing their recent trend of crisp-looking cards with nice borders and wonderful sub and chase sets topps has done very well with their 2006 line-up of cards. the basic card design doesn't stray too far from their tried-and-true formula of having complete mlb stats for each player and a brief insightful look at each player. these insights include quotes from players teammates stats from a particular time in the player's career nickname origins etc. this is one thing that always set topps apart from the pack. the front design includes action shots of each player trimmed in a border that somewhat coincides with each team's colors. the player's and team's name are trimmed in silver. the back of the cards have the aforementioned stats and a nifty cartoon in the upper-right hand corner with another brief insight into the player featured on the card. with the collapse of fleer mlb has begun working with topps and upper deck in an attempt to draw collectors back to hobby of collecting and trading baseball cards according to athlon sports' baseball preview. one aspect of this joint venture is the distinguishing rookie card logo found on all rookie cards this season. it will be used to remove any doubt on collectors' part as to which card is the authentic rookie card of each player. you'll find cards with that logo in this set from topps. another fine addtion to this set is the mantle/bonds homerun cards. with the scandal surrounding bonds these days his cards may not be worth hunting but mantle's cards are a wonderful find when you open a pack. topps has also thrown in a few autographs and relics as usual but the real doozies here will be the autographs of all-stars such as john adams and benjamin franklin. topps has inserted cards in their set this season featuring the actual signatures of each of the signers of the declaration of independence. i haven't been lucky enough to snag one of them yet but the basic declaration cards are a nice addition to the set. with historic sigs and mantle cards topps has proven that nothing is more american than baseball chevrolet and apple pie. a nice set to get ",negative

" highhgear is supposed to be in the outdoor and active gear business which one would assume involves some knowledge about how outdoor and active gear works. so what do they do with this item? they sell it with a ferrous metal split ring on the compass -- so that the thing will never point to north correctly as long as that ring is attached to the compass.

" this is my third heart rate monitor. i purchased this one because the battery died in my last hr watch. i thought i could replace the battery but when i tried to replace it i broke it. oh well. . . anyway i purchased the reebok fitness hr watch because it was on sale (50% off retail). i couldn't find any reviews on it so i rolled the dice. with my two previous hr watches it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions. with the reebok hr watch i had to read the instructions a couple of times. after a couple of training sessions i began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings. there are a few pros on the reebok hr watch: (1) the chest heart rate strap will work with precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors. (2) the chest heart rate strap's battery is easily replaced. (i don't know about the watch.) (3) it has a lot of features that you'll find in higher priced hr watches. now the cons: (1) the heart rate reading is much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses. (2) the shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it's difficult to read the small heart rate reading. in conclusion because the heart rate reading is too small and there's a glare i can't read the watch unless i slow down steady my arm and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare. because of this i'm disappointed with this watch. if you've got good eyesight you can add 1-star ",negative

" it is unfortunate to have to write such a review but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that i am compelled to do so. the unit was received new but the hinges were already rusted the closure hasp broken (poorly designed and executed) the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp. made in china this stove demonstrates no attention to detail quality control or materials. i own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory much less off the design table. further the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor if not downright unacceptable (in major ways). as this unit was new in the box i can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the us manufacturer has for customers. save yourself cut hands and returns buy another brand ",negative

" i recently purchased a bean round zafu and i find it didnt live up to the claims in the least. this zafu came shipped to me with over a pound less filling than advertised (wich wouldnt matter if the cover wasnt made so big to hold much more hulls than it came with). first thing i thought after pulling this cushion out of the box was; this thing seems nothing like the pictures. it's saggy and about half the height of all the images i've seen of it. not to mention once you sit on it you feel all the hulls displace to give you only about 2 inches or less of lift (i weigh about 160 pounds so i dont think that weight is the problem). i'm very dissapointed in this product. the reason i bought this was not only for the reasonable price but i thought bean seemed like a quality company. i payed $40 for this wich does seem reasonable. it does seem reasonable. that is till you tack on the extra 11 or 12 bucks for a pound of organic hulls to fill it to the level it was advertised at. i bought this product from the comfort store. their probably the only internet company; along with bean of course i will never buy from again. unless i learn more forgiveness meditating on my rolled up towel waiting for my extra hulls ",negative

" the sportline 353 talking pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an fm radio but it has 2 issues. the good: the talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on. it is nice to hear when you are rolling along 9000 steps. the fm radio is very elementary but functional. there is no dial to tune. you push a button and it rolls to the next station. there is a volume control on the earphones. the pedometer uses aaa batteries that can be purchased anywhere. the bad: the pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor. it didn't break but it was very annoying. several times it popped off w/o me knowing and i left it in a restaurant or in a friend's car. the ugly: if i accidentally bumped the reset button - on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair - the pedometer lost the day's count and went back to zero. the pedometer does not have a memory feature - so the tally is lost. this would sometimes happen 2-3 times a day. very frustrating. the clip broke after about 3 months -- so i retired it. i bought a omron hj112 premium pedometer and have been very pleased with it. it has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband the pedometer dangles -- it does not bounce on the floor. it has a 7-day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight. it has a clock. it uses a button battery. it does not have a radio and it doesn't talk but it works and works well. the sportline would be good if it had a teather a clip that didn't break so easily and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally.

" during the time i was considering buying this model i happen to see the same thing at a local department store; so i bought it. i couldn't wait to take it back. i wasn't impressed with the cheap plastic. the pump came with the adapter pre set for a schrader valve; my tires are presta. the blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the round end remove and reverse the plastic adapter re insert and then screw on the cap [tight as per the label]. seemed simple enough so i took off the cap took out the plastic insert [i noticed it is in 2 parts] reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap. when i put the end on the presta valve and then pressed down on the thumb part i couldn't help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve but was loose. so i decided to change back to the schrader type [and use my adapter valve]; maybe this would be a tighter fit. so i took off the cap and tried to remove the insert but only one part of it came out; the parts separated; i could not remove the bottom half. i was not going to force it out. i put the parts back together re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it. no thanks !!! i gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration for purchase ",negative

" i bought a sight from airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a christmas gift. the screws were too short to attach it to his airsoft rifle's weaver rail. yes i could go out and find screws the proper length but i though i'd make airsplat do their job. so after several e-mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. wrong. the diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. why by a gun from these guys? if it arrives broken you pay to ship it back. want a refund? you pay a 15% restocking fee. take a pass on airsplat.

" after 350 miles of moderate usage (6.5mph average at fairly low resistance for 40 minutes daily) a piece of metal snapped on one of the arms rendering the trainer inoperable. unfortunately this was considered a wear item and was not warrantied by the manufacturer since the elliptical was used *very* lightly (perhaps 20 miles max) during the first year of purchase (warranty period). i put the majority of mileage on the machine over the past four months and while it was great for burning calories i never really felt that it was a quality piece of equipment. it appears that the manufacturer knows what parts of the frame are likely to break first and conveniently labels these wear items thus making repair expensive and difficult... this is in spite of the fact that the piece that broke was a non-moving load-bearing support piece. seems a little fishy to me. throughout the life of the machine i was constantly tightening bolts to fix the popping and banging sounds that occurred after moderate use and observed that the wheels would often attempt to jump out of the tracks with heavier use. after about 70 miles i noted that the wheels were leaving large greyish streaks in the tracks from where they were wearing down against imperfections in the track surface. i believe this was also partly due to too much play in the interaction of the wheels and tracks allowing the wheels to jump the tracks a little which each revolution. this machine does not feel very sturdy and throughout the last month of its very short life gave me a creepy sense of impending doom whenever i used it... somehow i knew it was about to break and unfortunately it did. my hunch was real enough that i began shopping for a replacement several weeks ago. please shop around... i would not recommend this machine for people looking for a moderate to high intensity workout but it may be fine for slower walking or jogging paced routines that place less stress on the machine's mechanical components. if you are an infrequent user this model may be ok but if you plan on using it every day i would recommend that you keep on looking. note that my machine was a 428p which at the time of purchase differed from the 418 primarily in the computer and heart rate monitoring. the frame is identical in the 418 and 428p which appears to be no longer sold. since the problems with my machine were directly related to body construction they are appropriate for a review of the 418. unless the manufacturer has made major improvements the problems i experienced are likely to still occur. visual inspection of the pictures here leads me to believe that no major changes have been made to the frame construction ",negative

" i was attracted to the thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints for night wear and because thermoskin advertised that it could be worn while sitting during the day. the product indeed has a clever-seeming design and it is well manufactured. but ultimately this product seems to me to be too floppy and unstable to consistently stretch out the area of the foot that feels to me like it needs to be stretched. (i.e. the area along the sole of my foot that i can feel stretching out in the mornings when before getting out of bed and while sitting up in it i press my toes hard against a looped cord or towel; that stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out of bed.) the velcro fastenings are indeed secure but the product's sock-like sleeve and ankle cuff move around some even when the straps are cinched down as tight as they'll go; as a result what feels like an appropriate stretch typically disappears in about five or ten minutes of normal movement and friction in bed while lying down. worse the angle created by pulling the strap up through the buckle in front of the lower leg just doesn't create the proper stretch; instead it just makes my toes feel crampy. i'm going to try a rigid split which may be less comfortable. but i believe that i need to be strapped into something that consistently maintains a proper angle which the thermoskin product doesn't. and i'd rather incur some discomfort if it will actually help me get well than continue to use this not too uncomfortable (but ineffective) product from thermoskin. perhaps others have had or will have better results with it than i have had; and i have no medical training nor deep insight into the anatomy or physiology beyond what i've read on the internet so consider this to be very much a layman's review. i've been suffering from plantar faciitis now for about four to five months with little improvement and i can't compare this product to others that i hope might be more effective. but i was very disappointed in this product and regret having spent the money for it ",negative

" we purchased this atv for our son who turned 7 in february. the first time he rode it the battery came loose and disconnected. we fixed that within a few minutes and he continued riding it. the next day my son came in after riding it and the throttle was loose. i tried to tighten it but the allen screw stripped and it would not tighten. in addition the rear axle was bent from shipping. we called service and they sent us a new throttle and tire rims not axles. i did not even try to replace the throttle because i knew the allen screw was not capable of tightening properly. so i went to the local hardware store and purchased a stainless steel screw and was able to correct the problem. the next day after he was riding it the steering was out of alignment so i twisted the handle bars and force them to straighten out. i have to do this every time he rides the atv. the kids rode the atv yesterday and i changed the speed key switch to the lower speed so my 4 year old daughter can ride it. i have change the setting about five times and the switch broke. it will no longer change to the slow setting. it is either on fast mode or off. needless to say that my son does not want to ride on it because he thinks it will break every time he does ",negative
" i purchased two of these one for each of my sons. i received them quickly and the packaging was in good shape. when we took the first one out and tightened the handlebars and so on to get it ready to charge and ride everything seemed ok. but the wires where you plug the charger into the 4 wheeler had to tightened and so did the place you turned the key to change speeds. got it charging we think. then we start on the second one. we take it out and the charger is half melted. ok not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use the charger from the other one since they were the same. well when we plugged the charger to the second four wheeler after about 1 hour we went back out to the garage where it was charging and the charger we were using that had come with the first four wheeler had started to melt! nevermind that the house could have caught on fire! so apparently someone had plugged the original charger in and that had already happened rather than someone just having packaged a defective charger. nice for someone to pack it back up and send it to me used and defective. the first four wheeler turned on and ran ok for a few minutes so it must have been charged we went ahead and plugged it up as the instructions said - as if we had received it brand new like we thought we had. when it was used the first time it ran for a little over an hour with only the the light popping out of the front with every little bump. and the light didn't work. while trying to re-attach the light we found several places that needed to be tightened up. we can't re-charge it though because the only good charger between the two was melted. when we first took these out of the boxes they were small (big enough for a 3 or 4 year old) but they looked pretty sturdy much better than the plastic ones you get from walmart and i paid close to the same amount. they were difficult to get out of the packaging because there is a metal frame in the box that needed to be taken apart but that should have been good to protect during shipping. however when you think about how you are going to get them back in the metal frame and box and shipping to send them back so someone can possibly see how bad the whole mess is you start to get cranky and tired. i will admit that i haven't tried to return them. i am quite worried that it will be as much trouble as these things have been already. i am tempted though because i would like to let people know about this type of problem before they waste their money. imagine how dissapointed i was that right before christmas i couldn't give the kids two of their bigger gifts because they were junk. i am very upset. so now several hundred dollars (times two) that could have bought very nice christmas presents just flushed down the drain.

" this tricycle is simply way too big. while the seat position is adjustable even when adjusted this thing is simply huge! i imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster. by then he'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike so i just don't get the point of this. why in the world would someone build a trike so big? i did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires and was fairly sturdy (at least in terms of construction). i suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike maybe this monster would be ok. i did have a few issues with design and/or build quality though: first the grips are fairly fragile plastic and i imagine will break after just a tumble or two. second the way the seat adjustment works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar. this would be ok but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar so i had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place. overall i'm just not very impressed.

" i have an ics m4a1. i am basing my thoughts on this based on what some of the airsoft forums i am registered to have said on this. i am registered on arnies airsoft core and airsoft retreat. 1) this gun is from a very very unreliable company (well) so you have more chances of getting a bad gun than you do for getting a good one. this is common knowledge among the airsoft community. 2) lets say you buy 4 of these guns... each of them costing 100 dollars. even over a 5-10 year span that adds up to a lot of money being spent on a gun that breaks consistantly. people who have skirmished with an lpeg (low-powered electric gun) find that the exterior can actually break if shot at with an aeg that shoots 330 fps with .2g (standard for companies like toyko marui ics classic army g&g airsoft elite). the one thing that this suggests that the gun is badly made. 3) the gearbox (part of gun that fires bbs) broke on mine. in short it has a metal gearbox made of the cheapest metal known to man. the purpose of this for the company that makes to this get money. it is very very weak. definitely not worth it. 4) the hop-up on this gun is non-existant. the fundamentals of hop-up is a backspin is added to bbs to increase range and accuracy. effective range of this- 50 feet (not meters). effective range of my ics m4a1 (with a aftermarket tightbore added) is 150 feet. 5) this gun will get laughed at. some children walk into an organized skirmish with this lpeg telling people that it will own all others and they will cry home when players with real aegs destroy them. i suppose it is fine for backyard wars but who on earth would spend 100 dollars for a crappy gun for backyard wars? 6) the cost does not equal quality. if you think about all of the accessories that come with this gun (light laser ect) then account for shipping from china then the packaging costs (pre-molded styrofoam) you will realize that this gun is very very cheaply made. you do not want to be spending so much for so little quality. the laser itself can sell for 20 dollars. put it short it is not worth it ",negative

" the literature describes this unit as a flat-mount ski rack compatible with any factory-installed roof rack with crossbars. hardly. my vehicle is a 2006 gmc envoy with a factory roof rack. this rack is the same one used on many gm suvs so great numbers of them are out there. these racks have crossbars with a reverse wing shape that are tilted forward presumably to reduce wind noise. the thule universal mounting system will not conform to these crossbars and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward (or backward) at a silly angle. it can be used in this conformation but it looks odd. also the ski rack indeed locks over the skis/boards but the mounts are not lock-protected so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches. my searches found no alternative to this rack however and it does work for the intended purpose ",negative

" now i am a firm believer that breakfast is a very important time in your day. yesterday morning i was driving to the dentist's office when i realized that i had forgotten to eat. i started to have quite an anxiety attack so i pulled over at the only available place. a gas station. nothing really caught my eye as something i would like to put inside my body. now this was no ordinary gas station. this was a special kind of one where they had hot food behind the counter including supreme-pizza chicken drum-sticks and even breakfast-style food like a little sausage-egg-buiscuit-combo-sandwich. sure the food smelled alright but the thought sickened me that one of the mechanics or gas-pumpers may have had oil grease or even gasoline on their hands when preparing these dishes. while i was peering over the counter trying to scope out just how filthy their hands were something to my left caught my eye. it was a golden box of something called a powerbar. the name had me sold immediately (a food that creates power) and they were even individually sealed to prevent the repulsive hands of the workers from contaminating them. i'm going to eat a powerbar was the only thought on my mind as i purchased 4 of them on the spot. i hopped back in my vw cabrio and sped off down livernois towards the dentist's office. i unwrapped one of the powerbars. it looked just like a normal candy-bar but the name told a different story. just how much endurance and stamina would one of these provide and for how long? what kind of advantages would i gain? i thought i had found my new favorite food. finally a food that defines howard tuttleman as a person. that is until i took my first bite. my first bite literally took me 2 minutes to chew up enough to be able to work it down my throat. it was a tough rubbery nugget inside the chocolate that stretched out a bit like taffy. every bite had the same grimy and bitter flavor with an atrocious after-taste. my mouth felt like i had ingested a whole bottle of elmer's glue and every crevice between my teeth was gummed up with it. i reluctantly continued to eat the entire bar. my stomach began to feel as if i had eaten lead. i felt no extra power in my body. if anything the powerbar significantly weakened me by making me feel ill. i was convinced that i had simply picked a bad powerbar so i unwrapped another one to give it a second chance. by this time i was in the dentist's parking lot. if i went in now i could make the appointment on time but i had to try for more power. big mistake. the second powerbar was no different. it felt like the powerbars were fighting my stomach. i finished the second powerbar feeling even worse. my third powerbar however was the worst of the bunch. it was a different flavor and i nearly threw-up. i felt 20 pounds heavier. my teeth and lips felt like i had been eating drywall and were covered in chocolate and grimy nugget. i simply could not eat more than 2 bites of the fourth one no matter how much i tried. it was time to go inside. my dentist was a little ticked-off that i was late and got really annoyed about all of the powerbar remains stuck in my teeth. apparently i wasn't supposed to eat for a while before my appointment. i felt sick for the rest of the day. i gave my dog (morris) the rest of the 4th powerbar to see if it would work on a dog but it just made his butt really powerful that night and was a real pain to clean up after. please beware the name of this product is deceptive unless it is supposed to mean that the powerbar itself is powerful and will overpower you. later. howardtuttleman.co ",negative

" we have in the past owned an in step single jogger. it wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs. it always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside. if we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it. after being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling. we purchased the in step run around ltd 2 jogging stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs. the problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller. my husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break... it doesn't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down. it took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger. after that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride. when placing them in we encountered our next problem... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined. they wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other. as for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle. so off we set on our test drive. it was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn. after a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger. the only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell stay down kids...if you sit up one more time i'm going to sit in it and make you push me! well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart. i don't recommend this item. in all honesty our radio flyer pathfinder wagon does the job more effectivel ",negative

" we know strollers!! this is our 5th stroller over 4 kids. we decided to try a dually. pros: plenty of room for 2 children both about 25 pounds. cute cons: we're reviewing what we consider to be an expensive stroller. in our opinion the added expense shouldn't equal just an extra seat but better design and higher quality. 1) while the dimensions are listed in the description the relative size to every day objects are not discussed. objects like say doors. this stroller won't fit through 90% of the doors in the world. you basically had better only expect that it go through the front door of your house or plan on parking it in the garage next to your suburban. the doorway must be a 3'0 door (36 inches wide). that's usually only your front door. forget about pushing into or out of any interior doorways which are generally much smaller. 2) the straps are awful. again our 4th stroller. worse one of all. incredibly incredibly difficult to use. i'm actually flabergasted at how difficult the straps are. despite having tightened them up as tight as possible the two year old was out in under 10 minutes (once she decided to be out). 3) impossible to allow the children to sit up. again adjusting the straps to the utmost the angle of the backrest remains extremly steep. perhaps to counter balance the lack of effective straps? 4) hand brake is setup for the left hand. appears to be reversible if you want to work on it. 5) hood can not be lowered to cover front of children. if say you are walking into the sun (morn or evening) the kids are completely exposed. conclusion: very frustrating buy. wouldn't recommend it at all ",negative

" let me start saying that this is a wonderful product. small light and well constructed (they feel like they will last forever). you can carry them with you allowing to workout your fingers at the office at home or wherever you find suitable. i bought the four different color-coded gripmasters: black/heavy red/medium blue/light and yellow/extra light. i only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones. it was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price. the product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises: - trigger pinch. this one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination. - gross grasp. this one strengthens fingers thumb wrist and forearm for a firm grip. - hook position. this one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance. - tip to tip pinch. this exercise strengthens specific fingers thumb smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance. - wrist flexion. it strengthens wrist and forearm muscles. - key pinch. strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination. at the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports. if you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you but if you need finger strength control endurance and coordination you are in the right place ",positive
" i originally bought the blue (5 lb) red (7 lb) and the black (9 lb) gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. the blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. the blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so i ended inherited it. it is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light this makes it good for use anytime anywhere. (i have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) if i had to do it again i would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip probably have started with the red. just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping the challenge is working out the fingers. it is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. it has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. great product excellent for finger or hand exercise good quality ",positive

" wow it's not often a person gets excited about exercise equipment but my schwinn 213 recumbent bike arrived today. i have read several reviews about the condition of the box when it arrives. my bike arrived in a timely manner. the box had taken a minimal amount of abuse and was mostly intact. nothing inside was broken scratched or bent. the instructions were crystal clear. it only took me about 30 minutes to have it up and running. the hardware comes vacuum sealed onto a piece of cardboard and clearly labeled. the hardware for step 1 is labeled step 1 etc. i have never assembled anything with the ease in which this went together. it is a solidly built piece of equipment. i only tried it out for a few minutes but it is quiet pedals smoothly and has a ton of features. ok now for the things i don't like the list is small but worth noting. the fan and digital display is not angled enough for you to get any benefit from the fan nor can you read the display. only if you are very short and have to sit close to the screen can you read it with ease. i am 5'10 and the fan does not adjust to blow on me. i can just barely read the display from where i have to sit. a book holder would have been nice. that is it. the things i like far outweigh the things i don't. it comes with 10 pre-programmed routines manual mode timed trials etc. you can even input how many calories you want to burn and it will count down the calories instead of minutes. i haven't used all the features but so far i am thrilled to death with my purchase and despite some of the negative things about it i would still recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable way to exercise. 10-15-06 ok i've had this for a week now and i want to shout from the rooftops how comfortable and great it is. i solved my problem of not being able to read the screen very well but taking a crow-bar and gently prying up on the top edge of the metal plate that the read-out screen is attached to. take the electronic screen off before doing this. the plate bent up just enough that now i can read the screen just fine. i still don't get much benefit from the fan but the fan doesn't really blow hard enough anyway. i have tried out the easiest program and it is amazing. i can't begin to say enough about this bike. if you truly hate exercising this is the bike for you. schwinn has taken an activity some of us dread and has transformed it into something i don't mind doing. i am using this bike along with the weider crossbow another piece of equipment i can't rave enough about as my total body workout. i hope to be slimmer trimmer and stronger 6-8 weeks from now. also i want to mention again how quiet this bike is while operating. when i used a treadmill i had to either blast the television if i wanted to hear it or use headphones which were uncomfortable once i started sweating. this bike is so quiet you can have the television or stereo at a normal volume. if you are interested in an exercise bike that is comfortable and versatile this is the bike for you ",positive

" i don't actually own one yet but my boyfriend does so i've been sneaking over to his house to use it until i make room in my own home for one. when i first used it i was like some of the other reveiwers disappointed that it didn't work my abs the way i expected but then i realized i wasn't doing it correctly. it makes it pretty easy to use your legs and arms instead of just your abs so it helps to focus at the beginning on just using your abs and nothing else and then you can really feel it! the strap is way too small though i usually just put my fingers under it but there's no way to do somme things that the lady on the video does like sticking your arms through the strap and holding them straight...and i have pretty small arms. the range of motion thing is great and feels so good on the back which is the complete opposite of doing crunches on the ground(i used to do about 1000 crunches a day but then i started getting bruises on my back from them and i pretty much hit a plateau where i wasn't seeing any changes in my abs). i have so much fun using the ab lounge while i watch tv too it's a great way to make the commercial time go by. i would recommend that the people having problems with this try to go slowly and really focus on working just your abs it makes it so much more worth it ",positive

" two years ago i tore one of the transverse ligaments in my wrist playing racquetball which was the unfortunate combination of a dusty court 200 pounds of player moving about 15 miles an hour a poorly timed forehand and very hard wall. i had two surgeries to repair the injury and it was mostly successful. the biggest side effect has been weakness in my injured wrist and hand. i have moved beyond squeezing toys and putty but i lacked the strength to do weight training. this device has been a tremendous breakthrough for me. i have been able to make some rapid gains in my strength without risking injury with weights. i am already seeing the difference in just two weeks. if you are recovering from surgery such as carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries i strongly recommend making this device part of your recovery plan. of course check with your doctor and/or physical therapist before starting up a new exercise ",positive

" i used to try to strengthen my fingers using the gripp balls and later the gravity gripp which were grip balls that were also 1 pound weights. however they were bulky hard to get a grip on and heavy and pretty silly looking. so when i saw the picture of these awesome little gizmos in a catalog i ordered one right away. they are about the same price of the grip balls but they are so much cooler! not only is this good for fitness training they're even better for musicians! (my instrument is piano.) these are light and flat and they fit right into a purse. i don't feel silly using this out in public -- if anyone asks i just let them try it and they are immediately hooked. i carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend when i gave it away to a friend. it is difficult to know which tension to use. i'm a woman with small hands and found that i am right between the blue and the red. i use the blue one for 4th and 5th finger (left hand). i can usually handle the red one for everything else but the booklet says that repititions are more effective than heavier tension. i use mainly the blue one now. i hope to work up to the red but that will be a while. i'm also going to buy a couple more so i can work both hands simultaneously. i do have one caveat -- make sure you use these correctly. don't overdo it or try to use a heavier tension to just to feel all macho. like any weight training you have to press the buttons precisely to isolate the muscles. don't use your whole arm just to get the button pressed. i found that if i started to cheat i got a little wrist pain and felt the beginnings of tendonitis. (another reason i'm staying on the blue tension for now.) oh and buy your gripmaster here at amazon. they are $15 each everywhere else ",positive
" i originally bought the blue (5 lb) red (7 lb) and the black (9 lb) gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. the blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. the blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so i ended inherited it. it is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light this makes it good for use anytime anywhere. (i have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) if i had to do it again i would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip probably have started with the red. just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping the challenge is working out the fingers. it is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. it has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. great product excellent for finger or hand exercise good quality ",positive

" i recently purchased a pair of the gripmaster hand & finger exercisers in order to help build forearm strength. as i was unsure which tension would be appropriate i bought one each of the light/blue (5 lbs. tension) and medium/red (7 lbs. tension) grips. i've had them for a little more than a week now and i just love love love them! perhaps that's a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories but i really do enjoy the grips. i leave one out on my desk at all times and get in a little work here and there when i stop to read a document or whatnot. the gripmaster exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once or each finger individually (great for guitar players i've heard!). one side features four small levers each with its own spring that can be squeezed together or one at a time. the plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit. the black rubber cushion is removable and you can place it on either side of the grip. it's an awesome idea and allows for maximum versatility! just for reference i'm a female in relatively good shape but with painfully little forearm strength (my biceps are huge from years of tae bo though!). the 7 lb. medium/red grip is do-able but challenging. the 5 lb. light/blue grip on the other hand makes for a much easier workout; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things and i only feel it after a number of reps. if you're a female and not in great shape you'll want to start out with the light/blue grips (or even the extra light/yellow ones) and work your way up. out-of-shape guys can probably get away with the medium/red ones to start. if you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength don't even both with the lighter tensions - skip ahead to the medium/red or heavy/black. although i've only owned my gripmasters for a week or two and can't personally vouch for their durability they do seem sturdy and well-crafted. my fianc's brother an amateur boxer and guitar player used his for years without a problem so i have faith that i'll be squeezing these babies well into 2015! - kelly garbato couch potato turned fitness fanati ",positive

" baby einstein has done it again! they have created an engaging learning toy that both babies and parents love. the best part of it is (they call it) the activity star. it's what many of those cute babies in the customer images are smiling up at. the activity star has different settings for playing music: on short play and motion activated. it's also got a smiling face in the center and lights on each star-tip that flash along with the music. my 3 month old daughter loves the smiling face and flashing lights. compared to other play mats in the same price range this one is the best (in my opinion).

" i bought this dvd set at a warehouse store yesterday and i've just finished the first workout. there are some familiar moves from the original tae-bo tapes but these exercises are much more challenging. the 'billy bands' add resistance to the basic moves. this allows you to get a strength cardio and flexibility workout in one. the choreography is really simple so that even the least co-ordinated people should be able to stay in step. this is a very challenging workout and might be a little difficult for people who are not in shape. if you are moderately fit you'll find this workout to be fun and very motivating. according to my heart rate monitor this workout burned a little less than 700 calories so it will be a great substitute for a jog when the seattle rain hampers my enthusiasm to exercise outdoors.

" it had special meaning for me because when my two daughters were little (they are now in their late 30s) i taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they didn't flush. i caught them both with the toilet monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences. it is more funny than scary though it does give you a start when you first open the lid ",positive

" this flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense. this is meant to be an emergency flashlight and if you use it as such it is great. this is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn't meant to be. but when you need some light in an emergency a little shaking and you have some light. it's starting to dim? just shake it some more and voila more light. you could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help. i don't know why people are giving this bad reviews. this is so easy my 6 year old niece can shake it and get it working. and if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say the light will last longer then people on here are saying. if my 6 year old niece can figure it out i would think that adults could too. but there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything. this is an emergency no battery shake flashlight. i think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself. you should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles campers boats kids rooms etc. how many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you couldn't find new ones? this one has worked everytime i have uesd it. but then again i do have common sense. this flashlight is great!

" the cord-wrapped handle is a great idea offering more of a real sword-like look as well as a firmer grip. my hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken. this wrap really helps (though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place). the two-piece guard design is a nice enhancement too. though you really don't need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original. it's still a fairly cheap piece of wood compared to an ironwood version but at this price (it was $9.99 when i bought it) you really can't go wrong. a nice enhancement over the basic bokken. i do however prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off. nevertheless if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended...

" .....that's the day that the first wiffle balls (invented a year earlier) went on sale in this baseball-crazy country. mr. david mullany created the first wiffle ball in fairfield connecticut after seeing his 12-year-old son struggling to throw a curveball. mr. mullany (to whom we bow down and show obeisance) cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the wiffle ball an american institution was born. oh wiffle ball wiffle ball it nearly compels me to wax poetic. i'm now 46 years old but the love that i have for the game of wiffle ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch! my brother and i were born to a beautiful baseball-loving woman. shirley grew up following the cincinnati reds and as a child she acquired a nickname based on a long-forgotten big league pitcher. as an adult she worked for the los angeles dodgers and the los angeles angels (that was before they became the california angels and then the anaheim angels and then the los angeles angels of anaheim and then the chicago white sox victims). she instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for america's pastime. (in fact my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys little league team.) but when we weren't on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys and when we couldn't scrounge up two other guys to play a game of over-the-line at the park my brother doug and i were battling it out in a game of wiffle ball in the yard. we had some outrageously competitive games in our glory days. we perfected the art of pitching a wiffle ball and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us. i remember 1990 and a young athletic college student who claiming to have played wiffle ball throughout his childhood challenged this old geezer on the ucla field behind the john wooden center. well my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times he just shook his head and i concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child it wasn't what my brother and i called wiffle ball. if you have never owned a wiffle ball you've never really been alive my dear friend! although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time (especially if you hang too many curveballs for my brother who swings with great authority) they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise! they can be used anywhere outdoors because the wiffle ball weighs only two-thirds of an ounce and if doug never knocked one through a window neither will you! and although the wiffle ball is light it does not follow that it should be taken lightly. after san francisco giant (man do i hate the giants!) kevin mitchell won the 1989 national league mvp award he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of wiffle ball the previous off-season. one of the greatest hitters of all-time san diego padre tony gwynn used to hit wiffle balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball. play with a wiffle ball and you're in big league company! the wiffle balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety. (and surprise! they're still made in the u.s.a. the day production moves to communist china i'll jump.) twelve wiffle balls are currently going for $14.95 that's only $1.25 per ball. do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a wiffle ball? well take my word for it you'll get more than a dollar and twenty-five cents worth! now all you need to do is get the regulation old school plastic yellow (banana) bat. of course if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum wiffle ball bat. funny story : my dear ol' ma bought an aluminum wiffle ball bat as a gift for my brother on his birthday. but she wasn't sure what size to get so she called the company. how old is your son? the representative asked. when she said 41 he laughed loud and said i think you'll want to go with the heaviest model. one of the great disappointments in my life (seriously!) is that they didn't think to organize wiffle ball competitions until doug and i were in our 40's. we scouted out the competition at the wiffle ball world series here in phoenix a few years ago. (players fly in from all over the country!) we figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more if we polished our long-neglected technique over the next year. alas it never happened what with work and life and all the other crap that gets in the way of wiffle ball play. but that doesn't mean you can't fly into phoenix next year and win the title! get to it man! get yourself a dozen wiffle balls a banana bat and start practicing. hint : the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half. want to throw a drop? make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point. then get inventive; there are innumerable variations on that theme! you can thank me for the hint when you see me. you'll recognize me because i'm always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it!

" this is a beautiful slim sharp functional fast knife. the knife is slim and with the clip can be carried easily in your pocket. the safety on the end of the knife is a little stiff but can be adjusted so that it is easier to slip on or off. the pocket clip is reversible allowing you to carry the knife point up. this is a great feature because when the knife is carried in your pocket point up you do not have to swing the knife around in your hand to get it in position for opening. the knife can be deployed much quicker when carried in this fashion. the speed-safe index opening flipper works very well opening the knife quickly with just a little pressure on the mechanism. no grand flourishes thumb strength or wrist flicking is needed to open this knife. the finish is good the quality is great everything about this knife is amazing. a great knife to own.

" the leek is a wonderful knife but its sword-like point is subject to breakage. (throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip--which is what happened to two of my leeks!) fortunately kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand-new ones no questions asked. i just shipped them the knife explaining what happened and a week later got back a new knife. the knife itself opens beautifully though i've found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and isn't that easy to depress with one hand.

" it's an ok knife. that picture of it can trick you. if you look at the middle of the page it says we ship black if we are out of silver. don't get me wrong black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green. the odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery so i hope you like black weapons. the tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley. just try not to poke an eye out. when will you need a led light on a sword??? unless your fighting ninjas in the dark. do you know why this weapon is so cheap? i think that it's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive. just don't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine. p.s. if you're looking at my account name i am not neil meislin but i am related to him.

" the yoga studio where i take classes has a very hard floor and i have bunion problems. this mat is the solution. there is only one downside to this mat: standing one legged balancing sequences are alot harder with this mat. however since i take 3 power classes a week and 4 ballet classes a week i like the challenge. the upside is you don't have to worry about putting a towel under your knee or anywhere because the mat is to thick. i did place a skidless towel on it and it does move around quite a bit so i would not recommend using a towel over this mat it just won't stay in place. i will take the not so bad with the overwhelming good with this super squishy mat ",positive
" overall i'm very happy with this mat. at first i wasn't sure i was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two. i also initially didn't like the fact that the mat was rolled so tightly that it wouldn't lay flat but i solved the problem the same way a previous reviewer did - just turned it over.

" this bag is much better than the normal bop bags as far as rebound action.the old style falls all the down to the ground an then slowly comes back to standing position.this one much more like a real bag snapping back and not hitting the ground unless you hit it to hard of coarse.my kid's are 4 and 5 years and only use the bag supervised being taught proper punching/elbow/knee and kicking strikes!i would never leave this bag alone with them to thrash on it would break real quick and with a h20 base not good.great for young kids to learn on....(not beat on) the key is always learn to strike good then worry about how hard...

" i live in san francisco and we bike everywhere so i'd been trying to find a new bike trailer for my 2.5 yo daughter who outgrew her front mounted baby seat. everywhere i went the trailers were priced at $250 plus. i was a bit skeptical about buying this instep because it was a no name brand (wrong - it turns out that its made by schwinn) although it was priced at about half the price on others. when i research the product i found it to be lighter than the pricier brands. it runs smooth easy to attach/detach. i keep the stroller front wheels always mounted so that i my daughter falls asleep and i wnt to walk around she's can continue sleeping. i recently did grocery shopping with the trailer and my daughter. it has a rear compartment that fit 3 traderjoes paper shopping bags an additional bag in the front with my daughter and one more on the rear basket that is mounted on my bike. i've also taken my daughter an another of her friends (it sits two kids) and they loved it. overall a very good product - although not a sleek and cute as others like the burley - but its lighter and priced much below comparable products ",positive
" this knife's single blade a bottle opener nail file and two flat-head screwdrivers (one large one small) come packed in a slimline aluminum case. there's a can opener too--though i've never tried to use it--and a panel on one side that can be engraved. it's an elegant package and lightweight. once you're used to this little buddy you won't want to carry the standard red plastic version. the only caveat: don't take this to the airport. it will be confiscated. note: to avoid losing it you can attach a cord or thin chain to the small ring at the end. with this a woman can attach her knife to her purse and will be automatically reminded to return it when the task is done. a man can attach the chain to a belt loop. until i did this i had several walk after lending them to someone who needed a knife just for a minute.

" very well made product; easy assembly and mounting. the no wobble feature is excellent. highly recommend this product ",positive
" this bike mount is solid and well made. the instructions were clear and easy to follow for assembly. there is absolutely no play or wobble when traveling with bikes mounted. the only weak spot is lack of padding on the vertical frame to prevent scratches on the bike frames. we added some padding and taped it on and it works fine however ",positive

" this rack was great and easy to install. but i never got a chance to put my bike on it for the night i installed it some person backed into and ran off. what made it even more sad was the bolt that locks the rack into my hitch was bent in the hitch. since i was poor and not willing to pay someone to cut it off i painfully unscrewed it which took hours and blisterd hands. over all i though it was a great rack i just wished someone did not back into it but i know for a fact it did some harm to that persons car/truck.

" this is our second set of eyeglass mirrors. they are easy to use and once you get used to using them you don't want to go anywhere without them. i even find myself checking my mirror when i'm walking and don't have it on. one drawback that we've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent. but that hasn't really been an issue for us. give these easy to use mirrors a try. i won't ride without one ",positive

" if you're looking here you're obviously interested in playing better golf and therefore you need to own this. jim hardy has figured it out. forget everything else you have heard about the golf swing and listen to why the proper thing to do is: - take the club to inside and up on the backswing - keeping the clubface closed until you reach the top wherein you rotate your forearms to make the clubface open - and on the downswing you need to keep your arms behind you (some might say stuck) while simultaneously coming over the top to get the club out in front of your body - and swing well to your left to complete the through swing (i.e. never down the line.) yes this sounds like the exact opposite of everything you've ever heard. but then again employing your current method are you truly satisfied you are getting the most of your abilities? in most cases if one is being honest the answer is no. so it stands to reason your technique is wrong and instead of blaming yourself it's time to give hardy's plane truth a try. in addition to the video series which is amazing i would also recommend both of hardy's books as essential material. you want to get them all to keep reinforcing the proper fundamentals and since each has subtle differences in description and new drills you're more likely to find the keys that really make the difference for you ",positive
" the thule sidekick was the perfect size - not too big not too small. it did not appear clunky-big on top of the car nor was it too small to fit anything in. the assembly was a snap (did it with only one person - no problem). it withstood freeway speeds in oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box. highly recommended ",positive
" i was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy. i need a cargo box that i can put up alone on top the acura mdx-just the right size. the box was easy to assemble - less than an hour. it is also easy to attach to the vehicle. the box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver mdx. i just wish the plastic was a little thicker but i think it will hold up well. the box is sturdy after assembling i ",positive
" this item was fairly easy to assemble. would be easier with 2 people but i put it together in less than 30 minutes. it was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well. bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip. on the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours. the carrier held up well. i had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault. it was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and i forgot to use the covers for those holes. overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to florida ",positive

" i purchased the kurt kenetic two months ago and am thrilled with its performance and quality. if you are considering purchasing a trainer fluid trainers are the way to go. basically there are four major types of trainers: magneticwind rim driven and fluid. the later is the best hands down! fluid resistance trainers are more quiet smoother and more realistic than any of the others mentioned. the only drawback to the fluid trainer is that over time they can leak resistance fluid. there are three companies that have solutions to this drawback. i highly recommend that you research all three and test them out where possible. a good review page is roadbikereview.com . the cycleops fluid 2 is ultra smooth and quiet. they have a limmited warranty on thier products but are known for standing behind their trainers for life and will fix any issues probably for life! the one up trainer has all the advantages of a fluid trainer but uses no fluid in its designe it is made in america and carries a life time warranty. the kurt kinetic which i decided to purchase is imho the best because it utilizes a sealed fluid unit and therefore is guranteed not to leak. these three units are roughly the same price around $260.00. steep? think of it this way this product is going to be your companion for many winters so don't buy a loud crappy one with crappy customer service! you'll regret later that you didn't spend the extra $75 or $80 on a quality product. i also tested the blackburn fluid $100 bucks cheaper not bad for price but since it is new to the market i was unsure about durabillity or how well they stand behind thier trainers after warranty expiration. i have heard amazing testimonials of how cyclops kurt and one up have replaced parts and even whole trainers no questions asked! google these three companies and see for yourself ",positive

" i found myself staggered with sticker shock while shopping for a decent pair of mtb glove 30-40 dollars. no offense to the makers of these woefully overpriced digit protectors but please! i did some research on the web and the harbinger gloves received good reviews from a couple different sources. the price was a fourth of the competitors so i thought why not try them out. the gloves are great and i have been very pleased with their performance. not only do they have a cool look factor but they also are well made. there is decent cushion(no gel unfortunately)built into the meaty areas of the palm where you would expect and need it. additionally the velcro connection comes a little higher on the wristfor full palm protection which i like. another nice touch is the tough material used in the palm around the thumb and fingers. it serves the dual purposes of protection and grip. it is definitely tough and has handled some hard hands first touch downs. on the downside i know i might get sweaty hands this summer(live in sw desert) because the palm area is all plastic verses leather. yet this is a fair trade for the protection and rugged construction. if you dont want to spend 40 bucks on gloves and dont need to have a gel cushion these are the best bang for the buck ",positive

" let me just start this review out by making it clear that i am a huge basketball/nba/wnba/cba fan. i picked up this basketball and started dribbling it. i was amazed at two things. first of all it bounces really high and you very rarely have to keep pumping it up like you do with some other basketballs. you can use it both outside/indoors although it is geared for more indoors then outdoors. second of all the grip of the basketball is very good so it won't slip out of your hands. this has been the only basketball that i have actually owned that doesn't slip out of my hands. to wrap things up i will end my review by making it clear that you should go with spalding and buy this basketball ",positive

" i've had this bike for about a month now and it runs smoothly went together fairly easy and best of all its quiet! something i seriously appreciate in exercise equipment is when i can actually hear the television over the machine. the complaints about the box falling apart during shipping is legitimate. the bike i received had a cracked cover because of the dent in the box (arrived when i was at work or i'd have sent it back). when i called for service i was greeted promptly promised a replacement cover and told that although they were instructed to tell me ten days they'd bet more like 3-5. they even suggested that i consider where i was in the setup before i assembled the bike and whether or not i'd want to take it apart to put the new part in. very positive experience... now if i could just get myself to spend more time on it ",positive
" i ordered the schwinn 203 just a week ago. it was eligible for free delivery and i took advantage of that offer. it stated that it would take extra time for delivery however it arrived within a week. though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non-mechanical wife and i had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes. the directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped. once we were finished assembling it i got on it and started it up and began peddling. i was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all--mechanical or otherwise. i then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly. my wife and i both use it and love it. i am 325 pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts i don't expect to be 325 for long. super bike!! very pleased...besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee i torn up last year and it's doing fine ",positive

" one has to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on one's needs or requirements. imo the pros and cons are... pros: these tabs weigh only a few ounces but can treat up to 20 liters. they are very effective at killing off viruses bacteria giardia and cryptosporidium(epa accepted). this product is great if you can't build a fire or boil water. cons: one tab for one liter so unless you stock up you can only support one person for 5 days if you use 1 gal. or 4 liters per day for roughly $10. compare this to 96oz(~56000 drops) of clorox for $4 and it only takes 16 drops to treat 1gal. of water. katadyn claims that their tabs leave virtually no taste to the water but i disagree. there is a very strange taste in the water that is less tolerable than chlorine imo. minimum treatment time is 30 minutes for both. alternative: boil water for 5 minutes at any desired quantity at virtually no cost! : ",positive

" i agree that this is hands-down the best water bottle on the market. take a regular water bottle and add a flip-up bite valve that prevents leaks (just like on camelbak hydration backpacks). the bottle also includes a removeable straw so you can drink without having to turn the bottle upside down. my only criticism is that the bottle is hard plastic and may break more easily than the soft plastic water bottles that you can buy elswhere. however the lid is a standard size and will fit on most other water bottles. thus by combining the lid from this bottle with other water bottles you can get the best of both worlds. also it would be nice if the bottle had an insulation option so as to prevent condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle ",positive

" i had the original solid red victorinox that was borrowed and never returned (it was about 10 years old and still going strong!)so i purchased this one. i came back and bought about 6 more in sapphire amethyst and red for christmas gifts. everyone loved them! small in size but a real workhorse and easily hangs on your keyring without excessive bulk. it came in handy opening the boxes that were taped and the blade easily opened the plastic packaging that comes on most items now. i definitely recommend this product. if you have very large hands or need a larger blade buy a larger knife; otherwise this is the one you want.

" the kermis is bad-to-the-bone fast. this is not a bike for the average 'fred'. the kermis is super stiff and fast and handles high and tight. there is an element of stability on climbis & descents too as the bike is a flat-out roadster. i'm thinking of naming my first pet or kid kermis in hommage to this great road machine ",positive
" the bad news first: the extension cables are very stiff and they're shipped in a tight loop. don't expect them to straighten out easily. and they don't come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps. i just swap cables from whichever bowflex station i'm not using and get a much better feel. the ball ... is a ball. it does the job. the little pump they supply with it isn't great but it also does the job. maybe you'll tone your arms pumping up the ball. ;-) there's no check valve in the ball so be prepared to get the pump out and the plug in fast once it's fully inflated. the mat looks a bit cheap but it's comfortable and it does keep you from sliding around. the video is decent. even if you already know what you're doing it's worth watching to see how to do the moves using a bowflex. so far i wouldn't say you've even come close to justifying the purchase price. but those foot straps are just brilliant! once you've gotten them adjusted they'll go on and off with no problem making it easy to add stretches to a regular workout without losing your momentum. but once you have them secured they won't come off or even shift much when you're performing the exercises. that may sound like no big deal but i've used straps that took forever to put on and wandered all over the place while doing the movements. the four points for cable attachment are well-placed and solid. i've been doing resistance stretches for a long time and these are the best straps i've ever used. they're worth the price of admission ",positive
" this mat is great. my advice for all you yogis that can't keep your hands from reenacting starsky and hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative. you have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new (expensive) mat in the back corner of your closet. first i recommend that you buy an organic degreaser. give your mat a couple of sprays (not too much) give it a scrub with a brush hose it off and hang it out to dry. this should help. option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda. don't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes. i put my mat in the washer and haven't had any problems but i'm not sure if manduka would actually endorse that. with that and a little bit of wear and tear you should end up with a solid mat.

" i bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in colorado - i recently went in january and it worked nearly perfect! every location i could find an elevation marker the watch was within 10 feet. the thermometer works well also it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly. the watch looks great i wear it to work nearly every day. i would highly recommend it ",positive
" i bought the x-lander because i am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when i needed it. the watch is well designed and of good quality. a few things did disappoint me but i think they are outweighed by the features however. - it appears that it does not have a second time zone. why they would not include this is beyond me. as a pilot i want local time in 12hour format and zulu time in 24hr format. a traveler would want time here and at home. it is not there but is on other models they offer. - the dial is not the easiest to read and i had to use a magnifier to see the units information on setup such as feet vs. meters and celsius vs. farenheit. the display needs to be more vivid. the company does offer a white face with black numerals which might be better. it is a nice watch but not the greatest execution of the concept especially for $300 ",positive
" this gun is awsome it is the best gun you will ever get for such a good price and guns that are 10 20 or even 30 dollars more the gun is very very light and looks great you can take of the front and the arm rest to make it look like as machine gun or something scope is great and is a super accurate gun i have shot a can down from farther than 40 feet (one shot) the laser is not super good and hard to use but it comes seperate so you can put it on or take it of whenever a bb might ratle around in their once in a while but it will fall out over all greatest gun ever!!

" i am the leader of a team called point 0 i got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks. it shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more. the scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night. it holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top. but do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping. i am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks ",positive

" i've been shot by many other airsoft guns but this one really packs a punch...my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic. the automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead it will scare you that you broke it but no it's just the dead battery. the metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast. this gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble but be patient it's actually easier than it looks. i highly recommend this gun ",positive

" i feel this product provides excellent value for the occasional biker or hiker. while cycling i had filled the hydration bladder with water and ice. i also carried a 32oz bottle of gatorade in the the storage area. there was still plenty of room for snacks keys clothes etc. i purchased a sony portable cd player/radio. it fits nicely in a special compartment with the headphone wires coming out of a slot in the top of the pack. my radio also has a remote which is great when you don't want to stop. the chest and waist straps hold the pack comfortably yet snugly to your body so it is not bouncing around. the one negative that would report is the bladder hook. rhis is what the bladder suspends from inside the pack. i think it should have a latch or something to hold it more securely. what i found is that when you take it off it may slip off and then it pinches the hose which prevents drinking. i try to keep the velcro that closes that part of the pack close to the hook. this seems to help. overall though i am very pleased with my purchase.

" hot water in my flask doesn't stay hot enough for a whole day out and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature. i haven't tried heating water from cold - it is always at least warm when i start. it takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious but it does a good job. the clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug doesn't (it flops about) so i have to hold it to keep it properly immersed. it cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush ",positive
" this is the first cathe strength workout i've tried and i found it to be intense and challenging without being gruelling. however keep in mind that this is an advanced workout so intermediates like myself will probably need to lift less weight than cathe (i generally used 1/2 to 2/3 of what cathe was using) in order to complete the workout. cathe uses a variety of equipment in this workout including a barbell several sets of dumbbells a full club step and a toning band but i was able to get by without the barbell step or band (although my modifications may have further lowered the intensity of the workout). the main workout on muscle max is 68 minutes long but the dvd also offers several premixes: upper body only (42 minutes) upper body push-pull (33 minutes) lower body only (23 minutes) and timesaver (56 minutes). the full workout breaks down as follows: warm-up lower body chest back lower body shoulders bicep tricpes core and stretch (the dvd includes subchapters under each of the above categories; see cathe's web site for a full list of exercises plus video clip). during the warm-up you are constantly moving rather than performing static stretches but i liked that cathe still managed to thoroughly stretch each muscle group that was going to be worked. also cathe constantly varies the count which adds interest as well as varying intensity to each movement. another thing i liked about this workout was that cathe allows plenty of time between exercises thereby providing you with an opportunity to rest and to change your weights as needed. i also enjoyed the upbeat music some of it vocal. overall this routine left me feeling completely worked out yet not exhausted which means that it was enjoyable and has little dread factor. i think that both advanced exercisers and intermediates who are will to modify can get a great workout from this video--highly recommended ",positive

" this bench is a must have for outdoor sports. this is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out. it is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench. the bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go. the frame is made well. there were only two issues that i had with the bench. the first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material. second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields. the top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag. therefore the rate of 4 stars ",positive

" a quality product. low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over. easy to assemble. can't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside! have been riding it inside mostly using our legs (we're not yet 2 yrs old) to scoot around. however our bigger cousin (just turned 5 yrs old) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars. this trike will last a long time and thru many kids ",positive
" very impressive though it's a bit big for my two-year-old. he can't reach the peddles yet but manages to push himself around without too much trouble. i think the size is really more appropriate for a three year old or a big two-year-old. seems solidly built very sturdy/stable and sporty looking ",positive
" this little trike is wonderful!!! my 2 1/2 year old loves it as does our 5 year old neighbor. the ride is smooth and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers without the high risk of tipping over. i looked for a trike for many hours/days and am so happy with this choice ",positive
" this is a pretty good quality pack for the money. it looks good and feels well built. the height adjustment is a little tricky to adjust until you get used to it. it uses velcro panels to hold itself in place (plus a locking strap to secure it once it's adjusted) and you need to pull them both out to be able to adjust it up or down. it was very comfortable to wear over the course of my very first 2 day backpacking trip. my only real complaint with this pack is that one of the accessory loops on the bottom of the pack which was securing my tent to the outside of the pack ripped about 3 hours into the first day which required me to figure out another way to carry my tent. fortunately there are plenty of extra loops/pockets to hold things and clip thing on with and i was able to use those to secure my tent to the pack. so you do get what you pay for but this is probably one of the better packs out there in this price range.

" i love this ab wheel but some of the reviews here are ridiculous like when a woman claims it burned off 20 pounds in a month. that's 72000 calories or 2400 calories a day. to put that in perspective you'd have to run 24 miles a day every day to take off 20 pounds in a month just through exercise. let's say you can use this devise for 3 minutes before you tire out. heck give it the benefit of the doubt say 5 minutes. that means it might burn off 50 calories a day. if you did that every day (unlikely because your abs would want some rest) you could burn off just under half a pound in a month. and that's based on some pretty optimistic assumptions. so it's not a weight loss device. but it is a great ab strengthener better than anything else i've use. it'll tighten up your stomach like crazy and as long as you do some cardio to burn and keep the fat off you'll end up with a great flat ripped up stomach.

" i am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product since amazon/toys r us don't seem to have a clue - even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer. i bought this in-store at toys r us because sizing information was not available online (except for the size of the box for some bizarre reason) and i didn't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size. so let me share that information with you - this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20.5 to 22. i think overall that this is a great set but i marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection. from my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard i can say that i would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me. but with a young child who knows?! this is for my neice (i am not a parent) and whilst i am generally happy with the set as it is i think it would be nice to include the elbow protection (which is afterall available in other sets but does not appear to be available separately) to make a complete safety package. perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads or perhaps i am a touch too cynical ",positive
" i recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it. the rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners. also there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips. the sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don't have it fully zipped up. my only gripe and the reason it doesn't get five stars is that i think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately ",positive

" i recently purchased the gofit 40lb weighted vest and it's everything i hoped it would be. i was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts and this vest has proved to be a good choice. the weight is balanced well between front and back of my body. the shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks. the velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement. i have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting though it does hamper some bending movements. the weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter. i am well pleased with my purchase ",positive

" msr's pocket rocket is a great little cooker. best for going light and fast. perfect as a shared stove among two people and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water. i would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters more than this and it becomes a little unstable. if your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you. because this is a stove designed for the minimalist it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread. again great for boiling water and melting snow but not for actual cooking ",positive

" any bag that doesnt have a stand will not be perfectly stable without movement. just the way it is. so if you think you can by pass this point than forget it. but if your looking for a bag with a little more freedom to move because of space or living arrangements than you will be happy with this one but you got to remember its freestand. the biggest debate is water or sand? does it really make a difference? the best tip i can give is not matter of which one but what's under the bag that helps the most from keeping it sliding on the floor when in use. when considering water or sand.... water is easier to empty out than sand but sand doesnt evaporate or get moldy. if you have purchased this bag and your not happy because it is freestand than forget the freedom of movement and fill the base with cement there's an answer for everythin ",positive

" another reviewer said: i think this product needs a few improvements but in all it is a strong value proposition. here's what i would improve if i were in charge: 1. a higher resolution screen so that the gui could present more information. 2. macintosh compatibility. 3. the pc cable should be included. as it stands the cable and pc software costs nearly as much as the device itself. i say: as far as the higher resolution goes i wouldn't want the print to be any smaller especially if you have to deal with direct sunlight otherwise you would be hard pressed to see the readout. concerning issue 2 & 3 i have no comment because i did not purchase the software. however concerning the unit itself i have noted the following improvements which will allow me to grade this product 5 stars. noted suggestions for modification to the ecaddy. 1. the clip should remain however the ecaddy should be attached to the clip via a strong pull cord. this will allow quick and easy interaction to the ecaddy. (i have to suck in my gut to work the ecaddy while it is on my belt.) 2. the order of the hole/par/handi buttons should be switched to handi/par/hole. again this will allow for quick and easy interaction to the ecaddy due to the respective position of the player buttons. 3. a thin plastic slot simular to the player name slot should be added to the back of the ecaddy so the user can insert a card with the abbreviate names of selective golf courses. it is very difficult to remember the name of #1 #2 ~ #10. 4 this is a big plus and should be a major consideration: the players default score should automatically be set to the value of par for the hole. this will certainly please the user of the ecaddy. currently i will preset the values before we tee off because i know no one will get a hole in one on a par 5 hole. it is very unlikely that they will get a hole in one on a par 4 hole and it is rare to get a hole in one on a par 3 hole. this way it is possible to not have to be as busy with the ecaddy for many holes. before this product came along i had created a spreadsheet that i uploaded to my palm pilot which worked well but was very difficult to read in the sunlight and tedious to use the pen to keep track of the scores while keeping up with the pace of play. as far as the price is concerned i feel it's about right if you were able to purchase the unit locally. depending on who you purchase it from after shipping and taxes you may spend close to $60. i would feel very comfortable spending $50 tops for this product. nonetheless the ecaddy was a definite blessing. mike taylor ",positive

" i bought this as a christmas gift for my brother in law but after he opened it we all tried it on. i have very fragile long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when i'm trying to put the swim cap on or take it off. this one came on and off so easily without any hair-pulling ",positive
" i'm on my 5th cap now i think. silicone is great and lasts forever. unlike rubber (which can snag hair) and latex (which some people are allergic to) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn't lose elasticity. i have a some advice if you want to try this product that i've learned overt the years: 1. always rinse and hang dry. i've left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect it develops black spots. i don't know if it's mold it doesn't wash off...and you'll have to buy a new cap if you don't like the spotted look. 2. pull it on gently. i've ripped one when i was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it. it's not cloth so you have to be careful. this goes for latex and rubber too. 3. wet your hair first. if your hair is dry when you put it on you will trap air under the cap. and since it's not a permeable material the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside. 4. pick a fun color. that's it. have a great swim ",positive

" this is something that i have wanted for a very long time. when i first starting seeing the bowflex on those terrible tv infomercials i thought wow what a piece of garbage. later on while serving in the us air force over seas my squadron had managed to tactically acquire one. along with the rest of our daily regiment of physical training a few of us would spend half an hour or so each on this odd looking apparatus. it quickly became obvious that this was in fact not a piece of garbage. just as the few of us using it were showing some impressive results and starting to convince the rest of the squadron of its worth we were deployed to various points of interest throughout the middle east. when we returned the bowflex was gone and we were all very upset about it. it has been a few years now and i have since left the service. i sent my body into a sort of accelerated atrophy alongside a bit too much of partying to include too much drinking and too much eating. i recently re-started some of my training but i could only describe my progress as slow. then i came back to the bowflex found a good price for it on amazon and went for it. it takes a while to set up so unless you are patient and fairly adept to the use of lego's i would suggest that you not expect to use it the day you get it. if you do as i did i would suggest that you start out slow as i did not. i went with one of my old routines which pretty much kicked my back side for about three days (and after only one workout). the machine comes with a variety of assembly workout diet and overall health aids. keep in mind that the weight loss guarantee only counts if you follow their workouts and diet plans closely. now for the only part that matters. here it is: it works. now here's the disclaimer: it only works if you work. just like any other machine weight set pair of running shoes etc. this machine is nothing unless you routinely use it for a workout. if you already have a few machines sitting around you house that have say clothes drying on them then this is not for you. don't spend the money on this if you can't stick to a routine. just buy a nice tv and sound system. if you can stick to a routine this is perfect. if you want it to work a bit better add a little cross training such as running or swimming ",positive
" the bowflex is a replacement for one of the older models(original by schwinn)that my husband has used consistently for 12 years. it came in one huge box and took the two of us half a day to put together. the directions and diagrams were pretty clear. one piece was broken but they sent out a new one within the week and it is now complete. they have changed the power-rod holder so we can't salvage most of the old ones. my husband did figure out a way to position two 50-lb rods into the new slots so he could use more resistance. it is not as compact as the older model but it does fold up somewhat. overall he is very pleased with this purchase-- we paid less for this one through amazon than we did in 1995 ",positive

" gloves are toasty...perform as expected and are a sweet luxury after a long cold day on the slopes; however the d-sized batteries (1 per glove) are considerably more bulky than what i expected. most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 aa batteries...but no just one bit fat chicken-roastin' d-sized battery. good product but consider whether wearing the big ol' d's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves or whether you'll barely notice being bundled-up and bulkified anyway. may also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it's really nippy out.

" if you aren't prepared to use the swing setter a couple of times a week for ca. 5-10 minutes each time you probably won't get the benefit it has to offer. the cd and literature do a very good job of helping you to define your training regimen to which you need to add only the discipline to execute it on a regular basis. the effects it has had on me are as follows: a) despite my impression that my grip was solid it forced me to assume a stronger more compact grip that has helped me with my tendency to fade the ball; b) it has helped me to revert to being more of a hitter than a swinger (which i used to be when i was playing better) by forcing me to increase the speed of my swing (especially the backswing) and to delay release thus stopping my tendency to cast. the quality of construction is excellent; i can't imagine wearing it out although i see that the magnets can lose strength over time. my main problem has been with a looping swing - inside to outside. so far the swing setter does not seem to address this problem; i can still loop and have the magnets release at the desired time. i would think some of the other hinged swing trainers would be a better help with this problem. i do recommend the swing setter if for no other reason that if you have the discipline it will serve as a conditioning device to use during the off-season. good luck ",positive
" this is probably the most complete training aid that covers set up swing plane grip and tempo. however i still need video and pga pro to correct my swing. here is the fault that i found: i can snap the lower ball with flipping my left hand and coming steep on downswing. this is not a cure for all but it helps. the other disadvantage is the magnetic force in the balls diminishes fast ",positive
" i'm a 13 handicap and i've never bought a swing trainer before but i saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try. it arrived yesterday and i went through the warm-up and practice. first the grip felt very uncomfortable. over the years i had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip. this device corrected it immediately although i didn't know it at the time. after going through the routine described in the directions i went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls. my grip still felt funny but my tempo swing path and release had improved 100% in just a few minutes. this morning i went to the driving range. the improvement was dramatic. my iron shots were longer and straighter but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver. after about ten driver swings i got the hang of it... and... wow! there's a screen out at 250 yards. on a good shot i usually hit it on one bounce. today i was hitting the screen 15 to 20 feet up off the ground. thanks david. i can't wait to get out on the course tomorrow ",positive
" i am an avid golfer since the age of 18 and over the years i have tried all the gizmos to get rid of my shots that drift to the right (or slice under pressure). i have tried the medicus and still slice and other gizmos (swing jacket....junk) to no avail. the swing setter worked for me. it showed me a flaw in my grip (by the way this flaw was not noted by several instructors and others i routinely play with) and also stressed cocking of the wrists to help get on plane. i tried it and my shots immediately straightend out and now go straight or slightly left (still some over the top) but getting better every day. i recommend combining this with the swing rite for a powerful swing. you will still have to work with it a few times per week but it can be swung in the garage or back yard so you don't look like a goof on the range. give it a try it is cheaper than most lessons and certainly helped me. good golfing ",positive

" the previous reviewer provided a lot of good information about this dvd. i thought i would add a few additional comments. first you get a lot of bang for your buck with these $50 cathe dvds - they are definately worth the money. this dvd has 3 full workouts - boot camp muscle endurance and a combo (of the 2). there are also a number of other options on the dvd menu. i workout regularly with a variety of videos/dvds but i'm not that motivated when it comes to doing resitance training on my own. there is some light barbell work on sevaral of the firm cross training videos but my barbells were mostly collecting dust. i found cathe's dvds when searching on amazon. when i saw the description for this dvd it sounded like the perfect fit for the equipment i have but the price was really challenging. i decided to take a chance and go for it. needless to say i was very impressed and i even ordered another $50 cathe dvd. if you have the equipment (barbells dumb-bells a high step/firm step and maybe even a medicine ball) and you enjoy an hour of resistance training i would highly recommend this dvd. it's challenging for an experienced exerciser but it can easily be modified to to fit any other experience level. there is some intense ab work on this dvd too. if you don't have one you might want to purchase the heavy resistance theraband exercise band for $7.49 through amazon when you order this dvd. cathe uses this also and the standard resistance tubing/bands aren't a good subsitute. although there is no price difference between amazon and cathe's website when ordering through amazon the cathe dvds/videos are shipped priority mail. on cathe's website usps is not an option so they won't ship to a po box. if you live outside the continental us their only shipping options are 1 or 2 day air so amazon is a significant savings on the shipping if you live in hawaii.

" this inflatable kayak is functional and easy to transport given it's light wheight. once inflated it's easy to carry with just one arm when empty. it also has a very sturdy feel once it's completely inflated (i would recommend an electric pump that you can plug into your car battery charger). with both seats in the kayak there is suffient room and storage space for two adults and gear. i have been using this kayak mostly for fishing with my four-year-old son on small lakes. we generally carry two fishing rods gear box bottled water and other related items along with a dry bag. even with all this stuff in the boat there is plenty of room inside and with the seats in place i have plenty of support and elbow room for paddling. i haven't yet taken this kayak on down a creek or river so i'm not able to comment on its use in that scenario ",positive
" this inflatable kayak is a hoot! i bought one yesterday and did about 12 miles on the truckee river through reno in it with my teenage son. (yes i am incredibly stiff and sore and he's raring to go again.) first of all realize that this does not handle like a hardbody kayak. close but not quite. it is just a pointy rubber raft after all. it likes to go down the river sideways or backwards depending upon where the heaviest bottom sits. but it can be easily paddled by one or two persons to float just like the real thing. about thirty years ago i used to have a fiberglass kayak and went down many rivers here in the western usa. i've worn wool long underwear under a wetsuit to stay warm and have almost lost camera gear and food in rollovers. i kinda know how to handle a kayak. this sevylor should not be taken through anything greater than a 4 depending upon the skill of the paddler. it rides like a typical rubber raft through crests and holes. it might be fun to play with solo in standing waves but it would be hard to brace into because there are no foot/heel rests. there is no way to stay in it in a rollover. you'll just get dumped out. on the practical side it only weighs about 23 pounds can be had for around $140 inflates easily and quickly with a plunger air pump (sold separately) is easily portaged around the rough water has a very shallow draft is made from some very tough pvc is comfortable to sit in for several hours is easy to dump water out of cleans off quickly with just a hose and deflates in a heartbeat to be folded back into the size of a medium suitcase. for us it is perfect - affordable handy in the waters we frequent easy to inflate/deflate/store. i'm thinking of getting another one so that he can have his own and so that i won't get quite as splashed-on from his flailing paddling. he can also tow old mom on the wide slow parts. sue :) ",positive

" wow! i was really pleased with my purchase. i've never owned a heavy bag before so i didn't know what to expect. i just started martial arts so i wanted a bag to practice on but i didn't have a lot of money to spend. this purchase was not only well within my price range but the bag is high quality and includes a speed bag with gloves! the gloves aren't very padded a boxer friend of mine told me the gloves included were really for use on the speed bag. the heavy bag comes filled and is very solid the chain is heavy duty and the connections for the chain on the bag are well attached with double stitching. i was a little uncertain about just what the nevatear material was now i know. my description would be a heavy duty nylon with a slight rubberized feeling. in my opinion better than the abrasive canvas bags yet not as soft to the touch as a leather bag. two other purchases i would recommend are a good set of padded gloves for use on the heavy bag (i purchased some padded grappling gloves) and for the speed bag you will need two things: (1) a swivel attachement (i bought the everlast plastic ball swivel for about $15 at a local academy sports store) and (2)you will need to make or purchase a backboard and stand or wall attachment (i made mine from 2 x 6's and 3/4 mdf). all in all a great purchase! i couldn't be happier ",positive
" this kit also includes a speed bag!! the item description never mentions that. which is awesome but i already ordered one because i thought this didn't have it. however it is a small speed bag so keep that in mind. the bag gloves are very budget just like they state. so i doubt they will last long. the heavy bag is fully packed so the box is about 70lbs. other than that this is an exceptionally good value esp. with the free shipping ",positive
" this product is fabulous for peace of mind. the kit is comprehensive enough to give security for 72 hours. i bought some for my sisters and they love them too. as far as 72 hour kits go this is a lot of bang for your buck ",positive
" i purchased these for my parents who are both in their 80's in order to bring some resistance training into their exercise programs. my dad takes 2 mile walks and manages the snow blower in the winter. my mother does some treadmill walking. they really enjoy using these bands and i think it is benefiting them. they are simple to use and effective as if you work hard enough you can definitely feel it ",positive
" this gun is a good gun after the first charge. the problems are: the clip jamms and u need to get a screw driver the laserr is in accurate. thats all thats worrng. good things are: after the first charge its powerfull and accurate. its nice and ajdustable for anyones fit. its worth i would think atleast 50 bucks. its just a good gun nothing special ",positive
" this gun is really cool! it has decent aim great fire power and the charge lasts a long time. the only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb's at a time but hey you can't have everything. anyways great buy ",positive
" i am use to doing abs work and pilates on the carpet but my carpeting did not have enough padding so i decided to order an exercise mat. i a very please with my order. i noticed the difference right away. the cushioning it gives my lower back is awesome. ",positive

" this is the second suunto vector watch i have owned. only because the first one was lost. the only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years. seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better. the battery lasts about 6 months only.for the price of this watch ($230) you think tehy could do alittle better. other than that i love the watc ",positive
" i finally convinced my wife we needed to purchase a couple of these for training. my sons and i will begin training in kendo soon. i have a few regular swords (not the display only variety) and are very excited with purchasing some practice swords. i understand these come highly recommended after speaking with a couple of amazon customer ",positive
" this is a excellent product for certain needs. it is unmatched for ease of transport (i can easily carry four of them at once). the only drawback is that these tables are limited in how much weight they can hold. this makes perfect sense of course. if they were sturdier they would be heavier. a common sense approach to usage -- place heavier objects toward the ends and the legs rather than in the middle on the hinge -- will insure safety and longevity of the product. all in all a very good value ",positive
" it is a great football but is hard to grip if you don't have real large hands and is slippery ",positive
" get this gun but dont even concider getting the elecric version its a huge waste of cash. there like $70 -$80 and they only get about 20 feet of range when u point it at a 45 degree angle up. yeah its that bad. but this gun shoots good ",positive
" i just got this gun today and i just opened it but where is the lever or w/e u cock the gun with to shoot???? i dont wanna break the gun right away so please someone with this gun reply and tell me how to shoot it ",positive
" our family are backpacking campers. we make a big deal out of loading our backpacks with everything we need while striving to keep them as light as possible. i bought one my-ti titanium flatware set for my husband. we all loved it so much that i ordered more for me and our son. they are light weight come with a link to keep them all connected and we prefer them to the sporks. when we aren't camping they are in our lunch packs and/or picnic supplies. amazon.com had them at the best price ",positive
" my husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state--they wanted to share email address---no one had a pen/pencil so my husband's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with. everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside. my husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it---could not find it so i did some searching on the net and bought it for his christmas gift---he was so excited to receive it on christmas morning. thanks ",positive
" i've spent years camping with a bag of clothes half-strewn around my tent so a new tent led me to check this out to see if i can stay organized. the closet comes in its own thin carrying case. it looks complicated at first opening but it's easy to insert the fiberglass rods zip down the corners adjust the velcro seams and boom! you've got a very sturdy and roomy set of shelves for socks shorts t-shirts towels and medication. there's a zip-down mesh cover to keep things out of your stuff yet keep it ventilated and it rolls up out of the way. pockets on the sides for pop/beer cans wallet and the like are very handy and hooks for keys on both sides let you keep things where you can find them easily. there's even a pocket on the back that stores magazines and maps. but the value is in keeping things organized off the tent floor where you can see that stuff without having to paw through a duffelbag and toss things all over your tent. i'm happy to have found this neat piece of tent furniture ",positive
" it fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff. i use it every week to take drinks to sport events. it's easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes ",positive
" i live on a large college campus and have had my bikes stolen before but with this lock i haven't had anyone even try to steal it. it's not as heavy as i thought it would be (a plus) and it is pretty small so it can fit in just about any larger pocket. it feels solid and looks strong too. i would definitely buy this lock again if ever need be ",positive
" these are definatly very accurate. the seem is barely visable. in pistols these dont really crack but in my aeg rifle which is 360fps these crack at close distance. but keep in mind these are light .12g's and .20g's a rerecommended for aeg's. 4 out of 5 nice polished accurate bb's ",positive

" most replica type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall not these. made out a single piece of stainless steel these are very solid knives. as the previous reviewers stated these do come very dull but a file a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that. once sharpened these knives are very useable ",positive
" i would like to note i am not a fan of the riddick movie though a blade this unique tends to get your attention reguardless! this knife is very practical it's a solid piece of metal all around. i own a pair of these and used them on a grounded wooden post for hours! yet after my use they shown no sign of bends chips or dents! they shipped to me dull but hey i don't mind sharpening them myself. a word of caution you can seriously injure someone with these! their odd form makes them very deadly if sharpened as well as mine are ",positive
" this product is pretty much what i expected. the latex is a little dusty looking--not a clean crisp red at all. however it gets the job done for those pilates exercises ",positive

" this is a great little camp kitchen just the right size without taking up a lot of room at the camp site. i have another camp kitchen bought from a well known outdoor supplier but it's massive in size and more suited for extended stays the guide gear camp kitchen is perfect for weekend camping and shorter stays. it's compact both set up and in it's carrying bag it'll take up hardly any space while traveling. perfect size for a camp stove on the top table with a smaller propane or charcoal grill on the side table. the hanging pantry is strong and rugged with plenty of room to stock food paper supplies etc. this is a well thought out and designed kitchen and while compact has everything you'd need to enjoy the great outdoors. i highly recommend it...buy it try it.... you won't be dissapointed ",positive
" i haven't used this camping but i set it up in my living room as soon as i got it in the mail and it took about 2 minutes. it looks great and i can't wait to try it out camping this summer with my family of five!! i know exactly where i am going to put all of my camping dining essentials on this kitchen.

" it's always satisfying to see that a determined manufacturer can significantly improve even the simplest of devices. it's a pleasure to hold and use this bottle. i like: * not having to tip your head up to drink since the mouthpiece is connected to a straw inside that goes to the bottom - i've never seen this design before * easy to flip open with one hand yet you don't have to pull hard with your teeth like in standard designs * absense of taste compared to plastic bottles i don't like: * diameter of the bottle is too wide to fit standard cage all the way. it takes a lot of force to push it in about 2/3 of the way and it doesn't go further. it hasn't flown out during riding yet but i am looking for a wider cage now (not easy to find). why not make it standard diameter for bike cages ",positive
" i'm a small person at 5'2 so this 24 denali is perfect for me. i bought the 26 one and liked it but it was too big so gave that one to my husband. the bike was easy to assemble no problems with delivery very quickly. i like the way the denali shifting system so u can see what geer your in similar to my mountain bike. it shifts smoothly rides very nice this is my first road bike and am very pleased with it!

" this is the best knife sharpening system i have ever owned. the kit has 2 medium sharpening rods 2 fine sharpening rods a booklet a vcr instruction tape& the plastic storage case which doubles as the base. i can easily keep my spyderco delica knife razor sharp; also my wusthof kitchen knives. (even the serrated knives!) this kit takes all the guesswork out of keeping the right angle to sharpen your knives ",positive
" as a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools i've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels. while i've managed to master that skill (can shave hair off my arm with these tools) putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare. i've tried numerous methods none of which has worked well. about a year ago i puchased the spyderco sharpening kit. read the manual watched the dvd put my kitchen knives to it and......ended up with pretty dull knives. frustrated i put this kit in a kitchen drawer. fast-forward to last week. the kitchen knives are dull again and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives. so i pulled out the spyderco again and gave it another try. this time i tried sharpening my serrated bread knife. after just a few strokes it was good as new. so i tried it on the straight knives again but only got a modest increase in sharpness. now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel i tried sharpening my swiss army knife. again after a few stokes on the sharpmaker i had a wicked sharp knife. i was down in the workshop today sharping my plane blades and chisels. the last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane...the blade on these is very convex so sharping it is always a challenge. fortunately it does not need to be super sharp and never has been. the sharpmaker was sitting out so i said what the heck and gave the scrub plane's blade a few freehand strokes on the sharpmaker...no sharpening jig to hold the blade like i normally use. for fun i tried to shave hair off my arms....and it worked! i couldn't believe it...this sharpmaker makes sharpening too easy! it's american-made very well thought-out and works amazingly well when your blades aren't made of junk steel. what more could you ask for? ",positive
" this is the best and easiest knife sharpener ever. you can sharpen anyting with it...but i use it mostly for knifes. any knife serated stainless it works great on filet knives. it is quick and easy. i believe the brown stones are the key. they make getting a bad knife easy to sharpen. one you might think about taking to a grinding wheel but in a few minutes the damn thing will be sharp enough to cut hair. best of all the knife will hold an edge after sharpened. i bought one of these 25 years ago. i still have it and it still works great. i had to buy one for the motor home. since i don't sharpen the knives in there before we go. and once you have sharp knives you don't go back. i love this sharpener. mostly because my wife uses it too. we always have sharp knives. thanks for a great product!! thanks ti ",positive
" works well. much faster than the cheap metal swivel that has only the hook. if you don't have a wealth of speed-bag experience be prepared to re-learn when you upgrade to this swivel ",positive
" great swivel action tough construction easy to remove for adding air to your speed bag. worth the price ",positive
" the jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient. it doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact. getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter. this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them. i had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said i never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal ",positive
" this review is for nike t-90 club team (32 panels) i bought this ball for less than $15 thinking i couldn't go wrong. i hadn't used nike balls before so i didn't know what to expect. it turns out that this ball flies better is softer is rounder and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls. great practice ball and pick-up game ball. i would have no problem using it in a small club match either. as far as my $30 adidas balls? not a chance. 5 stars based on performance vs. price. i hope you get as good a deal as i did (through eastbay athletics) ",positive
" i recently recieved this gift as a birthday present. the batteries that it came with had a little juice in them already and since the directions said to discharge them completely before charging for the first time i fired off a few dry rounds and a few bb's. the blowback is quite impressive; i find myself shooting dry rounds just to see that nice blowback action. the batteries are charged via putting them in the gun and attaching the charger to the pistol butt - so far i've had no problems. the gun looks and feels authentic. i have not tried the flashlight during games just yet though it seems very powerful (after shining it in my eyes accidentaly :p). the main problem i had was with the magazine. to get it out of the gun you must pull it out; there is no magazine release button. this wasn't too much of a problem for me just new. however when i was loading the bb's into the magazine normally the two halves of it popped open sending the spring and bb's flying. i put it back together and taped the sides together as reinforcement and it works fine now. recommended for all not-so-hardcore players. ",positive
" this is a very realistic pistol. the blow back makes it look almost exactly like the real thing. it's range isn't as far as rifles but it still shoots across the yard. when you got shot with them from 10 yards away they still hurt a little. one time my dad brother and i were battling in the front yard and a lady in her car slowed down to see what we were doing ",positive
" we just got this bag today for our son. we got the short version of this bag but i don't see that version on amazon anymore. the outside is a very nice rip-stop nylon material and soft and cuddly and the zipper is very smooth. the inside is a little scratchy but i am sure it will be better after a washing. the drawstring around the hood pulls nice and tight to keep out the air. the only thing i was disappointed about was the color. the picture on amazon and on the box it came in is turquiose. the bag is definitely not turquiose! it is a darker blue - closer to navy - color. and the yellow is more of a mustard color not a bright yellow and the inside is dark gray. but my son likes it anyhow and of course it doesn't affect the quality of the bag. i like the fact that the hood turns inside out too ",positive
" i purchased three of these units to mount in a utility trailer. they did a great job on the trip of holding our bikes rock steady. very easy to get the bikes in and out of. great product ",positive
" this is a quite good item. i looked at a number or similar items on amazon and this one seemed caught my eye. it certainly does make drinking from a nalgene or similar (mine is actually from a different maker but of the same style) much easier. my only qualms are that it is slightly expensive for a simple piece of plastic. also it is a little irritating to have to take it out and replace it everytime you want to refill the bottle. you can fill over it i suppose but it reduces the flow rate so that you have to fill much more carefully and slowly which reduces one of the advantages of having a large mouth bottle. i also kind of wish that there was an easier way to access the lip of the bottle than having to unscrew and rescrew the top each time but that is a general issue with the bottles not this lid. but overall a very useful purchase ",positive
" this is a great skateboard ramp for kids who are really into skateboarding. if space is an issue this is a great product. it is very sturdy for any type of skateboarding tricks. i would recommend having an adult present at all times when folding the ramp because it is very heavy. the wheels on the side make it very portable. my boys are 13 and 11 and they love it ",positive
" i was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd $100. it recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in denali national park in alaska. the weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents but the price and features make up for that. it survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage. the two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy. the vestibules are very handy for storing your boots. on colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though. overall a good purchase.

" after reviewing some of the other devices to hold the ipod mini in place while exercising selected the armband carrier. it more than adequately fills the bill of what i was looking for. occassionally you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm but it holds the ipod firmly in place. it can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device. if you sweat a great deal while you exercise i would advise removing the ipod from the holder after you complete your routine. would recommend it to anyone who asks ",positive

" i have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best. the thickness (1/8 inch) is just perfect - not too thick so it's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning. what i really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip in a word it is comfortable.

" i bought this mat because my gym recently began offering yoga classes and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody. this mat is longer and thicker than the gym's version looks a lot nicer and has a good 'tacky' feel under my bare feet. and it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores. it's easy to hand wash (and comes with instructions) so i can keep it clean. overall it's a great yoga mat.

" i was looking for a bike trainer but did not want to spend $150 and up. took a chance on this one after seeing it being sold by nashbar and performance. it seems to be quite solidly constructed and holds the bike very steady and secure. i got it set up in 5 minutes without any difficulty. only 3 levels of difficulty but this does not seem to be much of an issue. it is not too loud but also not terribly quiet-- about as loud as our washing machine. overall for the price (i paid $80) this trainer meets/exceeds my expectations ",positive
" the clear instructions make this piece of exercise equipment easy to put together. it's also very sturdy and offers a wide range of exercises ",positive
" the first thing that i thought was this is a lot of equipment for the money. it comes well wrapped and is easy to assemble. took me about an hour. it's relatively sturdy although there is some minor movement of the frame when changing exercises (eg the frame will move slightly forward when moving from leg lifts to dips). overall i do not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based on the good quality of this machine. keep in mind that in order to use the chin up bar there needs to be enough clearance from the top of the machine to the ceiling as your chin will touch the top of the machine. most residential ceilings are about 8 feet ",positive

" if you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block i can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable. when you are pressing on the blocks they are firm enough to withstand your body weight but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure. blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you can't reach the floor in a pose. the lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm. there are many ways you can use these blocks and once i started to do the yoga step by step workouts/yoga practice sessions i found i really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" three things to consider in a yoga block: size material color. this thing is purple = ugly. the material is foam and this block will still be around 1 million years after i die - for a more environmentally sound purchase try cork for double the price of course. finally i like the size of this block most blocks are 3x5x9 this one is 4x6x9 which means that its more stable ",positive

" i bought a red ge lantern a couple of years ago. i have used it for power outages walking my dogs morning and night during the winter and rarely i've even used it for camping. i haven't done any definitive studies but the battery life seems to be longer than the 16 hours ge states. i find the light to be strong enough to read by. during dog walks the lantern has all but been submerged in rain and it hasn't phased it. and it's performance has not been affected by colder temperatures even down in the teens. though i have to admit neither the dogs or i wanted to be out very long in weather that cold. the workmanship is very nice. i recently looked at coleman lanterns and they have gone to a flimsy plastic top. the ge lantern is built very sturdily but is light enough to carry in one hand and still control a leashed dog. the only downside i've found and i don't consider this a big issue if the lantern is knocked hard enough say you slip and fall down a ravine in the rain the batteries will slip out of place somewhat and the light will either dim or go out. it is easy to fix just transfer both dog leashes to one hand turn the lantern upside down unscrew the base enough so the batteries can be settled back where they belong and tighten the base back up. i would definitely purchase another ge lantern.

" i'm currently in iraq and i ordered this bike although it took a while to get it (not uncommon in a package that is 90 percent medal) i was happy when finally i recieved it. i had a little trouble putting the brakes on and warped the alumimum screws that hold the brakes cables to the levers. after my small mishap i was on my way riding in 30 mins or less. i've had the bike for about three months or more and it has stood up to all sorts of terrain and weather. during the summer tempertures can reach 130 during the day and i had no issues with paint or the mechanics period. now its the winter season and tempertures drop down to 30 and it rains often; still no major damage or issues other than a little rust on the four screws holding the handle bars in place. i've taken this bike threw rocks dirt asphalt and plenty of sand. after a quick spray with the hose and wipe with a dry rag the bike is just as glossy and bold as the day i took it out of the box. overall i am very pleased with this bike and plan to bring it back to the states with me when my tour is up ",positive
" living in europe my husband and i were dubious about ordering a bicycle for our daughter who lives in usa. however knowing the reputation of amazon we risked it. our final choice was the women's ranger by schwinn. it was assembled by a friend without any problems as the excellent manual was most comprehensive. the bike is beautiful and we - and our daughter - are thrilled. it is made of high quality components yet is fairly light. it is sturdy enough to handle the roughest city streets which is where our daughter will be cycling. the gear shift is smooth and effortless and the brakes excellent. as a footnote the first bike arrived with slight defects was returned to amazon who sent a replacement before even receiving the first bike back! we were most impressed! the second bike is perfect! it looks so good too - quite important for women ",positive
" the wife and me each got a set and tried it out today. we were surprised everything was great quality and looked nice. the fins are great cut right thru the water. the snorkle is also great kept water totaly out in waves and when diving. the mask was good/ok. you can't go wrong with this package. wish i would have got the other us divers kit with the little better mask and same fins for a few bucks more. we are happy. dan & melissa ",positive
" bought this for my husband for father's day! delivered in no time! he loved it! i let him do the registration etc. because he has more patience than i. it works very well. bought the vice like attachment too so it could go in every golf cart we use including our own. i love it. i have trouble judging distances and this is our co-toy now! the battery went dead too soon. we called sky golf and they are sending a free one out posthaste. we even bought the $19.95 warranty for one year. it's worth it!

" i have used this unit twice and have been more impressed each time. first time was a loaner from my favorite golf shop and the second was the unit that i just purchased. my reaction... wow. great tool for golfers at all skill levels. the information presented appears to be extremely accurate and is much more accurate than guessing or finding a marker and then interpolating distances. i found the intelligreen feature extremely useful. i was able to shoot at several greens unseen whereas before i would have laid up in a safe visible landing zone short of the green. the target lists were consistent with the features i was concerned about on most holes. if anything i found the target list to contain too many items i found registration and set up a bit tedious and would like to sky golf make it easier. be sure to read the installation instructions in the manual very closely. your internet browser must be set to allow cookies from sky golf. otherwise you may spend all day and never get set up or be able to download courses. the variety of plans for course downloads is adequate but i wish they would include at least a 1 year subscription to the basic par sky player course download plan with the purchase of the unit. others have complained about quality and construction. i don't know what their standards are but my unit seems well constructed and of very high quality material. bottom line if you can afford it and you're looking for a great product to improve you knowledge of the golf courses you play... then this product is for you.

" i've been doing yoga for 7 years. i've gone through a couple of regular sticky mats by now (i don't like how they get stretchy after a couple of years) so i decided to buy something more durable. i love the texture of this mat -- it's very solid feeling with a good bit of stick -- and it doesn't move around at all. it has just the right amount of cushion to it and i use it on a hard floor. i also bought the lumi towel (large size) also by manduka to put on the mat since my hands and feet tend to sweat by the time i get to the middle of my routine and this can make any mat slippery. i didn't have any trouble with the coating on the mat -- it wore off after a little bit and i used the towel until it did. i also didn't agree with some of the other reviews saying it was too heavy. it's a bit heavy but not too much to carry around all over -- i made a carry handle from a yoga strap (looped over both ends of the rolled up mat) and throw it over my shoulder ",positive

" a little caveat -- this review is actually for the exact same flooring system in the 1'x1' size tiles (which worked out better for me because they are a little more flexible in terms of configuration for a smaller space). that said these floor mats are really great! i wanted to create a home gym space for doing floor aerobics & step workouts as well as pilates yoga weighted workouts etc. these fit the bill absolutely perfectly!!! they are stiff enough that there's no danger of ankle instability because of a too-soft surface but they are soft enough that when you do floor work they provide excellent cushioning. my knees used to kill me when i would do a runner's stretch but now i actually go ahhhh as i'm doing them which is great. not even a smidge of discomfort. they are also really great for absorbing the jarring of high-impact activities. talk about an ankle knee and hip saver! the only discomfort i still notice and i really think it's just me) is during floorwork when i'm on my side to do leg lifts i have some problems in the area of the greater trochanter (bony prominence at the top of the femur). but i am very sensitive in that area due to running a marathon recently so again i really think it's just me. anyway i just can't say enough good things about these mats -- i highly recommend them. now -- to address the title of my review..... my only complaint about the mats -- and i'm echoing another recent reviewer on this -- is that when i first put them down they slid all over the place on my hardwood floors. because they are not completely wall-to-wall in the configuration i had them this was a problem. i was able to solve the problem completely though by buying one of those sticky under-carpet anti-slip pads that you can get very inexpensively. i found a yoga sticky mat placed underneath did the trick as well. but i would have had to put about 3 yoga sticky mats underneath to cover enough surface area to keep it from slipping. in short if you have hardwood floors like me (i don't know how they would perform on carpet or other surface; you'd have to see another review to check on that) i highly recommend these mats without reservation -- provided you are willing to shell out a tiny bit of extra dough to get an anti-slip pad to put underneath. also if you do be sure to get one that covers the whole area of the mat (or very close to it). otherwise if you come down on a part that's not protected during a lateral move you may find yourself sliding across the room and losing your balance. a little expensive but really worth the investment in my opinion. happy sweating to you (or whatever activities you plan to use the mats for). : ",positive

" i ultimately purchased 4 of these bikes for my beach house. they are very reasonably priced and provide a sturdy ride. they look like a true beach cruiser and have fenders a feature not often found on less expensive cruiser bikes. they are easy to assemble. they were shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound. the ride can be a bit stiff but for the price you cannot complain ",positive
" these gloves are extremely high quality. they do a great job of protecting your hands and for most exercises they do help your grip. the have the best wrist support of any glove i've used to date. however as mentioned: if you have small hands the added padding/rubber in the gloves will decrease the circumference of your grip in general. this is a problem for exercises like deadlifts chin ups etc. also the material inside is a bit like felt. when your hands are sweaty these gloves basically adhere to your hand on the inside and it usually takes me 1-2 minutes to get them off. they may just need to be broken in more but i've used them for 3 weeks thus far.

" the scooter is fine. the post office lost the package though. i called the company and they told me they would issue a refund only after so many days/weeks and would not send a replacement unless i was willing to pay for it in advance. i opted to purchase another one through a different company that used ups instead of usps (more reliable shipping). several days later the first scooter arrived three weeks late. the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it. so now i have two and only needed one. i realize usps is at fault for the shipping but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker. the scooter was a present for a birthday. i ordered in plenty of time to receive prior but ended up with a very late present ",positive

" first off those of you calling it a clip should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself. please call it a magazine (actual name for it) and a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30-06 round. second dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument. you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun. this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away. its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar. it's plastic it shoots things. i'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance. so yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you. not a sport. i also suggest getting .20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water. have fun. p.s. though they may noth have the trigger finger ability spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb's. if you are playin with friends i suggest getting a $30 dollar rifle with 250-300 fps (shoots like 300-350 ",positive

" we had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two. that seems simple enough unless you've actually been inside of some of the two-person tents. some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents. we have just used this tent for the first time and we are so far pleased. plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags and a bit of gear. a large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs. i believe this will be a great warm-weather tent with all of the mesh. the night we used it it dropped below freezing. we woke to a ceiling (rainfly) covered in ice (on the inside). didn't really expect that with all of the ventilation but as it was ice it didn't drip on us. i'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather. one thing that i don't like although thus far it has not been an issue is a seam running through the middle of the floor. it has been taped and sealed at the factory but i just don't like the looks of it. i will seal it again before spring use and edit this report as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south texas. the tent is in fact lightweight and roomy and so far i am pleased. i will amend this report after having enountered weather with it ",positive
" this really is a great tent. three people can sleep in it but i've found it best for 2 people because then there's still room for all of your stuff (or a dog. lol). i've used it for 3 years and it never disappoints. i've been in one good thunderstorm in it and it did great and didn't leak at all. it's very easy to set up (especially when you arrive at your site after dark). it vents really well but best if you face the vented side into the wind. just don't forget to open out the little cross vent (with the !) on the other side. the inside pockets are really handy and i think you can get a net that you can hang from above for more storage ",positive

" i've had this backpack for about 5 months now and i still have a great opinion of it. it holds many books and folders... it can also accomodate my inspiron laptop with a 15.4'' screen. the backpack doesn't have an included laptop sleeve so i found a solution by buying the sumdex padded large laptop sleeve which isn't very expensive but very protective and a perfect fit and just putting the laptop in the sleeve then putting the sleeve into my backpack. even after doing so i still had room for a couple of books. keep in mind that this does make it a large backpack slightly bulky so if you aren't in need of something with such a high capacity then this might not be the backpack for you. the backpack doesn't have a lot of organization as far as dedicated slots for pencils pens etc... it just has a few smaller zippered openings. if you have a lot of stuff in them you will be having to fumble around your things. i didn't find this too troublesome overall though. the backpack is comfortable and seems to be holding up pretty well against all the weight of my nursing books etc... i am happy with my purchase as i always have been with jansport purchases ",positive

" i just got this from khol's. they had it on sale for $11.99. when i saw it there were plenty on the shelves. i was kind of curious as to what they were because of its funny shape. there was a try me sign on there. so in my boredom while waiting for my ride i read the directions on the back and actually tried it. it was kind of funny to read 'wind up for light'. i'm glad i checked out the aisle. i've never seen anything so cool. it's very simple to wind-up the flashlight. the ball has a special roller that allows you to pump easily. it's not difficult to follow the instructions. anyone could do it. the lightbulb is led so according to my internet research led: leds have an extremely long life span twice longer than the best fluorescent bulbs and twenty times longer than the best incandescent bulbs. the design is actually very nice to the touch. it's padded with some nice rubber grip so its not unpleasant to hold. it's not very heavy at all. it's about the size of a male's electric shaver. i bought it at khol's for more money than its listed here on amazon. i got it today and i showed my younger siblings. they loved it too. basically the light is powered by the mechanical motion of your hand. it's really simple to use and its a comfortable design. i plan on going back to get more tomorrow.)

" i after drooling over this watch for two years wishing i had one i finally got one and have had my advizor for two months now. all i can say is that if i had known how cool this thing really was i would have shelled out the $300 a long time ago. each one of the features listed above does everything you could want. the heart rate monitor has target zone settings average workout heart rate highest and lowest hear rate and more. the altimeter tells your rate of ascent total vertical climb and stores all the data from recent workouts in memory. the coolest feature is that it will store your heart rate altitude and rate of ascent/decent at intervals from 20 seconds to ten minutes so that after a workout you can scroll though and see how your heart rate was affected by altitude and acent rate. i got completely geeky with this information after one workout and i typed it all into my computer so i could see what it looked like. the only drawback to the advizor is that it gives you so much information it would be great if you could download it directly to a computer for analysis. there is no pc link so any analysis has to be done on the watch or typed in by hand. but other than that this gizmo is perfect. no problems at all so far and i use the thing for two workouts a day. i am a cross country ski racer and for a long time i had thought that this would be the perfect training aid for endurance athletes and now that i have tried it i know that it is ",positive

" this review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike. first off this is my second mongoose. i started out on a crappy low end cruiser model so anything even half a step up from that model is a vast improvement. the theory weighs about 38 lbs and is actually light grey in color despite the image on this website. i thought i was getting a white bike and i'm a little ticked it's actually grey but whateva. assembly isn't too bad as long as you have half a clue as to what you're doing. the documentation is adequate but don't expect to be able to assemble this bike correctly if you haven't done it before. the documentation will frustrate you. but the average person can probably install the pedals and the saddle and maybe even mount the handlbars correctly assuming the brakes don't arrive screwed up like mine did. the front cable had to be relocated because when it was assembled at the plant it was threaded immediately under the fork and the tire was rubbing against it so it had to be removed and resituated which entailed messing with the front cable. simple enough i suppose but this assumes you know what you're doing. i couldn't install the front tire correctly because of the disc brake and wanting to be safe instead of stupid i took the bike to an lbs and had them install it. it was then that i found out one of the disc pads was missing. no problem. i just went back home and found it in the box. apparently it had become dislodged from the housing on the front tire during transit. i didn't even know it was there because i haven't worked with disc pads before. it was a good thing i didn't toss the box right away otherwise i would have been sol. just be advised however that if you are missing one or both disc pads and do toss out the box before you realize one of the pads is missing depending on where you are you may or may not be able to find replacement pads. you may end up having to upgrade to a better brand disc brake. now onto the specs. the front disc brake is promax brand dsk-400 which in the world of mtn biking is the generic low end. i had to do some digging around on the web to find the following site because you won't find a [...] website. it wasn't really all that much more helpful and did not help me to understand disc brakes any better but at least you'll have a better idea what to look for. the documentation on the site have color images vs the black and white images that come enclosed with the bike. go here instead: [...] i wouldn't call the promax disc brake crap but close enough. note: if you plan on doing any kind of semi-serious mtn biking as in on a trail considered intermediate level then upgrade the disc brakes. and if you're planning a real mtn biking trip with rocks and logs and the whole nine then the theory can probably handle it just don't expect miracles. as to the gears there are 21 shimano flavored and they work flawlessly. they're a pleasure to have because there isn't the usual slipping and dragging you see on lower end mongoose mtn bikes. the only problem i had was the upper gears don't seem to want to shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say to 2 then upshift to 3 for example and so forth for the others. if you want 6 then go to 5 then upshift and vice versa. this may or may not be because the cogs need to be lubed. as to the ride the theory is a dual-suspension bike and you can really feel the difference vs a hard-tail bike. wow. just riding on the street and going over speed bumps and rain gulleys is amazing. you have very little to no shock at all because the suspension absorbs it. overall this bike is good bang for the buck but i wouldn't pay over $300.00 tops for it. if you're going to go that high you can get something else with higher end parts. oh one last thing. if you value your reproductive organs and don't want to find yourself numb from package to exit and/or sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a week after using the bike then do yourself a favor and switch out the saddle. the one that comes with the theory is horrible. get a thicker padded gel lined split saddle instead.

" when the product came i realized that it wasn't what i was looking for in a fanny pack but i was impressed with its rugged construction. i needed a pack to walk around disney world and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy. i like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day. the water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle. plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another dasani. unfortunately you can't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn't stop a regular 16 oz. job from slipping passed. so i'm returning mine but if your looking for non breakable wide mouthed water bottles in a rugged waistpack then this is for you. ps for some reason the blue one is cheaper at least when i bought it ",positive

" well i originally ordered the black utg black sniper rifle but was out of stock at air-splat. well i could have waited 3-4 weeks or get the green utg od green sniper rifle that i had been thinking about ahead of time. so i sent a reply e-mail and they sent this rifle about 3 days later. the screws you get some screws now on the newer versions the long screw that is supposed to go in the port behind the trigger is not the long screw. you put in a short screw well at least for me. i had tried to figure out what was wrong finally decided to call them and they told me what to do. now to the gun- excelent. definently get a scope if you plan on being a sniper. also have your friends wear good goggles and no bear skin. it will either bleed or nice a welt and if thats cool with you than by all means dont tell them untill its to late. the gun itself should only be used with .20g and up. anything less will ruin the gun. with .20g you can easily punch through a unopened can of soda. the gun in a airsoft battle is a bit mixed. personally i stay back and take head shots at the other team's leaders and medics. with the bolt-action that you use you can decide when you are going to relode. also you should also get alot of white .20g. with white .20g you can adjust where you fire and get even more accurate shots. pros: very accurate very painful (could be con depends on how you look at it) weighted well very intimidating looking cons: a bit heavy for long games (but you should be moving anyways now should you?) if you dont sight your scope (or dont even get one) there are no aiming sights it would be a bit wasy to miss ",positive

(but please note: he doesn't swim for more than one half-hour at a time so i can't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity.) he also said that the fit is very good and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types. for the price these are an excellent bargain ",positive

" you want to loose that gut build muscles everywhere and become a lethal adversary all at the same time? then get a punching bag and pair of gloves. to be honest the hardest part is getting the bag to stay on the hook without pulling out your ceiling every few days. you need to consult a hardware store for the right bolt fitting. getting this right is half the battle. when you have finally managed to find the right bolt type for your ceiling then you are on your way to becoming somebody else! 10 minutes a day will make you a mean lean machine within two months guaranteed. start by looking for the boxing posture on the internet. take up this basic stance and learn to throw punches while protecting your face with the other glove. tuck that chin in. you will cut your knuckles even with gloves on but these wounds will heal and soon you will find your hands hardening up with each blow. move around the bag and make those strikes count each time. feel the punch and try to avoid awkward possible wrist breaking miss-strikes that you don't want to make. within a few days you will find yourself building up a quicker pace. everyday your arms will be firmer and your muscles bigger. your hands will become stronger. take off the gloves at the end of the punching workout and try chopping the bag with the base of the hand directly under the thumb with the thumb stretched out and the elbow bent. strike downwards and sideways with the palm facing down never up. harden up those chop areas of the hands. now when you have built up some nice chopping combos without gloves and boxing combos with gloves it is time to throw in some elbow blows. move that hand in towards your chest and strike just above the elbow with each arm. twist that body and harden up those areas on both arms. start striking with elbows gloves or chops in whatever order you want. build up a rhythm to your workout and soon you will be throwing twenty move combos at the bag. you will stun yourself. now the next step is either to take up a proper boxing course for correction or go study some manuals on close quarter combat. it beats most of the far east martial arts by using some brute force quick knockdown strategies. try get tough by w. e. fairbairn for starters. rubber knives are also good. learn the strategy in kill or get killed by rex applegate. keep up with the sport boxing and learn these powerful world war ii trench warfare close quarter combat manoeuvres for self defence. and it all starts right here with the bag. bag owners simply have the power ",positive

" the gym is very easy to assemble took me about 45 minutes on my own. the book supplies several different workouts hitting every major muscle group and you get good resistance in every workout. you won't get great range of motion on all the workouts there may be times when you'll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch but those are minor adjustments you'd probably have to make on any other type of equipment. the gym itself is light easy to move around the house and doesn't take up much space. it may be too light and not sturdy enough in some instances and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand-up workouts. the price is outstanding at 180 dollars. you're not going to find a better deal than this and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive bowflex ",positive

" a friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the blackburn airfix after i bought it. he has had many occasions where his chain has broken or his tires have punctured so he wanted to compare the weight of the blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides. the airfix weighed in at about 245 grams - about 8 ounces - and his tools including inflator tire levers hex wrenches and chain tool (all included in the airfix) tipped the scales at 337 grams - about 11 ounces. i suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools but for handiness this seems hard to beat. the blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee is also very attractive. so while i have yet had to put this tool into action with either my trek 2200zr or my trek 6000 in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern pardon the pun i imagine i have made a wise purchase ",positive

" i really like this bike. it feels like a bike from the '50s but with all the modern technology. the look is great and draws a lot of attention. it is somewhat simple to complete the bike since it arrives mostly put together but the assembly instructions are the worst i have ever seen with any product. i basically got no clue from the instructions on how to finish off the bike it is hard to believe how poorly they are written. i was beginning to believe they sent me the wrong directions. after i got it together through trial and error the brakes and the shifter were way out of whack and i had to spend $30 at a local bike shop to get these items adjusted; the instructions for making the adjustment did not work. the guys at the bike shop took two attempts to get it right (two trips for me) and they were wondering why it was so difficult to adjust. after all that was done i love the bike and it rides nicely and when properly adjusted shifts and brakes very nicely. the ride is comfortable and i love the seat and location of the handlebars. i would recommend the bike for all the fun and looks it has but be prepared for some hassle to get it right unless you are one of the lucky ones who gets one that is adjusted correctly out of the box. my suggestion is for the manufacture of this bike to fire the idiot who wrote the assembly instructions and hire someone with some writing skills. i also do not understand why the brakes and shifter were so far out of adjustment; did no one test the bike before they boxed it up ",positive
" the pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. the odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. the set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). the manual is well written and thorough. the cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate ",positive
" i just received the blackburn delphi 6.0 earlier this week and i've already put it through a few rides. i'm upgrading from a cateye astrale 8 that i've had for a long time. i've started training with a heart rate monitor more seriously lately and i thought having a single integrated unit to handle both features would be great. i almost bought the delphi 5.0 a while ago but decided to hold out for the 6.0 to get the nifty altimeter features. here are my impressions about my new computer good and bad... pros: - the mounting bracket system is very clever and seems better that the cateye bracket i was used to. changeble soft platic shims line the bracket clamp changing the fit for different handlebar diameters. 3 different thicknesses are included which chould accomodate everything from skinny aerobar computer mounts to oversized road handlebars. - the altimeter function is great. the altitude measurement is solid and seems very accurate. the percent grade reading acts sensibly even though it lags a little (this is explained in the manual). the distance climbed at the end of a ride agrees very well with topographic software and works far better than the gps-based solution i had been using. - the lap feature is great for capturing statistical snapshots of particular segments of your ride. had a big hill on your route and want to know how much you climbed and how fast you averaged up the grade? the delphi makes it really easy to see those sections taken out of the whole. up to 20 laps can be recorded. i think of them less as laps and more as intervals. - the backlight feature is very cool. i've always just done without computer info at night before...but this way i don't have to. i'm sure it kills batteries but it's nice to have. cons: - the average speed algorithm seems a little flaky. it seems to read ay least 0.1 mph slower than one would get by simply dividing distance by ride time. my cateye always agreed well with the calculated value but the way the delphi is figuring the average must be different. this is liveable and seems to be less of a problem on routes without a lot of stopping. - the max heart rate reading can get ruined by frequent spikes so that the real max hr is unknown. finishing a ride it's possible that the max hr will show something unrealistic like 235 probably due to a signal glitch or some interference. then you have no way of knowing what the true value is. these spikes don't affect the average however. i should mention that i've seen this behavior on both of the standalone hrms i've had before...so it's not unique to the delphi. - the cadendce sensor was hard to mount so that the magnet was close enough to the sensor. i had to put the magnet very close to the end of the crank because the crank arm is close enough to the chainstay at that point. but mounted there the magnet covers the back side of the pedal spindle. if you have pedals which require a hexkey from the back side to remove that could be a problem. they could have remedied that by making the cadence magnet a little thicker. for comparison my cateye crank magnet was mounted in the middle of the arm with no problem. - the wire from the cadence-enabled bracket to the cadence sensor is very long. this may be good for putting it out on aerobars or something and i admit that too long is better than too short. but i have a foot or more of extra cable to try to hide around my shifter cable housings and it's hard to tuck that slack away. and i have a large bike frame with plenty of tube real estate to spare. - unlike my standalone hrms the delphi doesn't calculate calories used. not that those numbers are ever accurate anyway but it would be nice for ride-to-ride comparison. general thoughts overall i think it's a great computer. the negatives above all are really minor issues and i haven't found a computer yet that offers as much for such a reasonable price. there's a lot more to tell than i can include in a review like this. i'm just trying to hit the big highlights (and lowlights). but definitely no regrets on this end for buying it.

" this product is phenomenal. it reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly. it worked under my wetsuit. it works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming. it works between your thighs or on your chest when running. it may even prevent blistering on your toes while running but i can't directly confirm that. i'd recommend reapplying every four hours ",positive

" body max is a very tough dvd. i didn't find the step choreography too difficult to learn but some of the combos were a bit quick and advanced. i do recommend watching the cardio before attempting or you'll be rewinding quite a bit like i did. cathe's cuing is great especially while teaching the combo. the complete workout is long and tough but completely worth it. if you don't have enough time there are several premixes that have shorter lengths. the premixes may be shorter but they're no less intense ",positive
" this dvd is tough... but don't be scared. cathe does a great job with the premixes and you can pick shorter versions of the workout. i love the music on this dvd.... it's so much fun... it makes me want to keep jumping!!! the upper body routine is about 20 minutes long. it's efficient and straight to the point. i've never seen results as quickly before... cathe will definitely delivery results!!!

" recently we had a chance to use a bongo board about 40 years old. it was all wood with quite a large drum. the one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons. it is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity. the drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost and balance is frequently lost. finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them. great investment for year round fun ",positive
" i bought this stroller to replace my combi-ithru but found that i needed to keep it. although this schwinn stroller has proven to live up to its reviews has one slight draw back. the recline position is a bit to far back for mall strolling making it a bit uncomfortable for the baby. aside from that the schwinn handles tough terrain like a mercedes benz or cadillac. its great! baby loves the outdoors and the comfort of this stroller. it has ample room and keeps her protected from the elements. it steers like a dream! grandma loves the fact that it turns on a dime. no extra effort needed. the big wheels and shock absorbers make it a smooth ride too for the sleeping baby. my daughter is 13 months old 24lbs and 32 inches tall and still has plenty of roomto grow into. the stroller has great storage space below and the handle is height adjustable. the only thing i don't really like is the upmost recline position is a bit to far back and seems uncomfortable for baby the reason why i kept my combi i-thru. aside from that i recommend it to anyone taking long walks in multiple types of terrain! this one can handle it all. happy strolling.

" very very good stroller! and very convinient too. this stroller can be used on different type of terrains and is very maneuravabble. the only thing that i don't like is that the seat cannot recline or can be made straighter. my husband tried to work something out but the thing is that the manufacturer haven't thought about it ",positive

" on the advice of my chiropractor i decided to buy an inversion table but didn't want to spend a lot of money because i feared it would be yet another piece of equipment that would end up collecting dust in my spare room along with my rowing machine and exercise bike. so i purchased this calm system because it was inexpensive and i figured i could sell it or send it back if i ended up not using it. well so far i and my spouse have found it to be very good for relieving back pain and best of all you don't have to spend a lot of time on the machine. about 3 or 4 minutes a couple of times a day is all it takes to relieve lower back spasms and stretch out the spine. also the machine is quite light weight and easily folds to shove in a closet or behind a wall unit. overall i am pleasantly surprised and would recommend this system. there is no need to spend a lot of money in order to experience the benefits of inversion therapy ",positive

" our very busy toddler (17 months old) is having a good time with this scooter. it is very well made especially for the reasonable price. the wheels do not scratch our wood floors unlike some of her other toys. she is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys. this one is one of the better ones. the only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground. she is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet. our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months. once they are in their twos our girls have preferred trikes so i'm also not sure how long this will last as a 'favorite' but it can definately be 'handed -down' or given to friends as it is going to last for years ",positive
" we purchased the razor scuttle bug trike for our two year old daughter and she absolutely loves it! she spends hours each day zipping around on it and it is sturdy and lightweight. my only suggestion/complaint is that it is not adjustable in height. she is a bit tall for her age and it would be great if the legs extended a few inches. would likely fit best for children ages 18 months - 2 1/2 years and under 35 tall. item comes pre-assembled and folds up flat. highly recommended ",positive
" i struggled with the decision to buy this trike thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth. however i ended up getting one for my 3 year old and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough. whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius and me and my back thank them. i no longer live in fear of daddy push me since pushing doesn't require bending over to that terrible pushing a tricycle stance. the trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver. it has a low center of gravity and doesn't feel quite as tipsy as some. i recommend it ",positive
" the power blocks are great if you don't have a lot of space to keep a full set of dumbells. changing weight is very easy and you can go change weight in 5 pound increments. in addition to the 45 pound set you can get an upgrade to increase the weight of each to 60 pounds (for around $150) ",positive
" we just got this bike for my 4 1/2 year old. it is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride. he is 45 inches tall and has about 1.5 inches clearance over the center bar. on the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter but i don't see how. it is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it. overall the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking a back pedal and hand brake. the styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage. i would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful. the enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and i was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions. putting it together is somewhat intuitive and i did figure it out but better directions would have been much appreciated.

" i usually do not endorse a product as a must have due to the diversity of personal preference in not just air soft but the firearm community... however this item is the only exception to my rule. i got this speed loaded to compliment my mp5 with a 100-round drum and anyone with carpel-tunnel syndrome can testify to it's a real pain to load that much one at a time. to satisfy this problem enter the speed loader. pretty simple design and execution; open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly. that easy. easily loads a 30-round magazine in less than three seconds. it's inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks... which it shouldn't unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover. sounds ridiculous but i've seen it done by the air force guys i play with. but let's face it; if you only have so many magazines/drums you're going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick-loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you. i strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch; i carry mine in my bdu pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although i try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort. i strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it's made of plastic not metal. lastly a warning; don't go too overboard with the primer. sometimes if you're not watching it you'll overload the magazine/drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you've wasted ammo or you have to clean it up... unless you're at a friends house let them clean it up. ; ",positive
" if it were possible i would buy one of these for every airsofter in the world. you need this loader!!! most guns come with those stupid loading tubes that require you to push the bbs down with a stick... that is the worst thing to use while youre getting shot at. this will speed up your loading time dramatically. buy!!!!

" first i want to make a slight correction to the previous reviewer's text: the size/weight of the gloves doesn't change according to the size of your hand but rather to the size of you the user of the gloves. if you are an average sized male you will be hard pressed to find a sparring partner if you only have 10oz gloves: nobody in their right minds would agree to spar with you because with such small gloves the risk of injuring the receiver of the blows goes way up. hence 16oz is the standard size for sparring gloves. women can use 14oz and children 14oz and 12oz depending on how big they are. the point with heavier/bigger gloves is to protect your training partner. anyway on with the review: these are good all-around sparring gloves. their over-all quality is quite good and even the velcros are done well so you could use these for thai boxing as well without scratching your partner's neck and shoulders when clinching. however i found that when you put more power behind your punches your knuckles tend to come through a bit so they're not the safest gloves around. still they are good enough for pretty much anybody who's looking for a good pair of gloves for sparring. i recommend that you get a separate pair of bag gloves or 10oz gloves for bag and mitt work since hitting the heavy bag and focus mitts harden the leather which again makes the gloves more dangerous to use in sparring. remember to wrap your hands and wrists when hitting the heavy bag in order to avoid knuckle wrist and shoulder injuries. everlast is a good company and for the most part they make quality products. these gloves do what they are supposed to do ",positive
" similar to other reviewers i was looking for a bench that i could do both abdominal and lower back work. this was the only decent bench that fit the bill within this price range. the construction is nice and sturdy the assembly was no problem and overall i'm very pleased. the only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating for me is the lenghth. i wish the main section were a foot longer which would allow me to more easily use it with dumbells for chest work. although i do love how you can raise the thigh support for curls - i wouldn't have known to do that if it weren't for the photo on this site. bottom line: good value for a versatile bench ",positive
" stamina ab /hyper bench has sturdy construction. it is well built for home gym. ",positive
" this bench was the best combination i could find that did both sit ups and hyper back exercises. it works suprisingly well for what it costs. the lower leg holder can be set low for back exercises and set higher for sit ups. the padding and covers seem decent. lots of adjustments. it's not as heavy duty as the ones at gyms but for at home i am satisfied ",positive
" this bar is great when used properly i.e. make sure the door is closed when you use it. i was surprised how well it worked much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches. ",positive
" i recall first hearing about bag balm at an adult scout leader training retreat. one of the participants started talking about bag balm and how he used it for everything from burns to lip balm. needless to say i was intrigued and upon returning from the retreat did a little more investigating. when i asked my wife whether she had ever heard of the stuff she immediately said that she had and that one of my toddler nephews was then using bag balm under a doctor's direction for pesky diaper rash. i then began to question some of my horse riding buddies. they too had heard of it and used it with very positive results. i immediately went out and bought a big tin for my medicine cabinet and a couple of small more portable tins to keep around my office and car and use as lip balm. i couldn't be more pleased. i have used bag balm as an excellent lip balm and have used it on minor cuts and abrasions as well. rubbed directly into the skin. under band-aids. you name it. the stuff as originally touted by my scouting friend seems also to have antibacterial properties. now i am not a doctor and i don't play one on tv so please don't take that as some sort of prescription. putting it in a nutshell bag balm is incredible stuff and it works. i highly recommend it! the horsema ",positive

" i got great results coaching 2 teams last season in 2006 using the zip n hit as a training aid in addition to live batting practice. we would work it into our routine for pre-game drills and starting practice drills. with every player maybe getting another 20-25 swings at a moving ball at each practice and pre-game session over a season it adds up to 200-300 extra swings that you can't get from live bp (which takes too long you must retrieve balls). both of my teams last year batted as a team over 0.400 in both bronco and pony. i had several players bat over 0.500 and 0.600 too. it also helped them develop a level swing which improves the batting average and become better situational hitters. other opposing teams also began copying us. perfect for pre-game warmups where you aren't allowed live bp i.e. regular games tournament games. our league is now buying one kit for every team in our league as basic equipment. the players can even help drill themselves.

" i bought an older model of the petzl e32 p myolite 3 headlamp a couple of years ago for a trip to the grand canyon. although it works well when on the move whether for hiking at night or finding your way to the water cooler or latrine it has two drawbacks when using it in a fixed location: - a: even when using the 3-leds (which is the less-bright option) it is so bright that one can not easily use it for reading nor can one use it in ones tent without disturbing your tent-buddy. - b: even when using the 3-leds it is so bright that it is difficult to use it to read since it makes the white of the page reflect back at you. also the weight is a bit heavy on one's head. it is for these reasons that i just went out and bought the black diamond zenix iq for my upcoming trip to yosemite. i have been playing with it in my apartment tonight (with the lights turned off) and i can already tell that this black diamond model is far superior to the petzl i bought 2 years ago. the zenix iq has the following features: - it is much lighter and more comfortable than the petzel - it has 6 brightness settings (as opposed to petzel's 2): it has 3 settings for the two leds and it has 3 settings for the ultra-bright bulb. - it has a multi-function colored led that acts as both a headlamp finder in the middle of the night (when you wake up and are looking for your headlamp) and as a battery meter to warn you ahead of time when your batteries are starting to get low ",positive

" i purchased a coleman exponent f1 ultralight stove this past spring in preparation for a trip to the cascades in oregon. i have owned a liquid fuel stove for years (msr whisperlite purchased in approx 1992) and have loved it but as i am getting older i have been wanting to trim my pack weight down. i have found the following advantages to the f1 ultralight. #1. easy to use. simply unscrew the burner head open the pan supports screw the burner head back down screw stove onto canister light match twist valve and you are cooking with gas. #2. no priming. the liquid fuel stoves required priming and pumping which made them harder to use than i would have expected. with this stove you simply turn the valve and light. no waiting for the generator to heat up. #3. very light weight. the stove assembly itself weighs less than just the small fuel bottle for my liquid fuel stove alone. this thing is a feather on the back. the disadvantages are there as well. #1. canister stoves rely on the low boiling point of the fuel to force fuel vapor up and out of the canister and at temps close to or below the boiling point which is close to 0 fahrenheit the stove simply will not work. for me where and when i camp this is not an issue. #2. fuel cannot be used as an emergency fire starter. #3. fuel is expensive compared to white gas or unleaded gasoline. the owners manual claims this stove only works with coleman brand canisters but i have found that any threaded canister of 70/30 butane / propane blend works. i have used brunton coleman msr and some odd black canister i bought at a gas station in oregon with it all with excellent results.. compared with other canister stoves such as the msr pocket rocket brunton optimus crux snow peak giga power stove or primus yellowstone techno trail the coleman exponent f1 ultralight had the design that made the most sense to me sported the lowest weight (.4oz lower than its nearest competitor) and from what i was able to determine in impromptu in store testing appeared to have the best pot stability of the group with pot supports that spread out nice and wide. one tidbit about this however is... the evernew 1.3l titanium cookpot is oddly shaped on the bottom and sits and a slightly odd angle on the f1. i have tried many other pots and this is the only one i have a problem with. the issue is whith the oddly dimpled bottom of the evernew pot and not with the coleman stove... summary. if you camp where the temps aren't freezing low weight ease of use are important and cost of fuel is unimportant then this is the stove for you. however you must carry some other sort of emergency fire starter in lieu of having stove gas to start wet wood. if however the cost of fuel is going to be a factor for you or you are going to go mountain climbing or whatever you will want to bypass any canister stove at all and just go with a gasoline model instead. the coleman f1 ultralight is the lightest of the group of stoves i had considered had the best design and came in at a price point that i liked. for the majority of backpackers out there i would say this would be the best stove for you.

" the two most respected bodybuilding supplements are (1)whey protein and (2)creatine. they are also considered natural products or food products. while whey is without a doubt extremely useful creatine does not help everybody. i have used creatine monohydrate in the past and i found it to be useless. it was so utterly ineffective that i just felt robbed of my hard earned money. my tub still sits in the cupboard. i have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are. i heard about no-xplode from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years. i researched it and it appears that bsn has formulated a surging creatine + nitric oxide drink that seems to work with most people. not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts. although no-xplode contains some serious chemistry (see below) and possibly some debatable compounds (guanidino propionic acid [gpa] and glycocamine) it is probably well worth the very low-level risks for the results. 40 minutes after taking this stuff i can either cardio high intensity for 30 min flat (maybe even more) and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power. no fatigue. the surge is exactly as it promises. you will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body. it sets in at about 20 minutes for me. i feel a little woozy at first disorientated then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic. put it into action and you will see results. it also boats a cem3 type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does. i never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion no-xplode is standing on the fence saying i am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects. so far this stuff is getting very good feedback. yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients but if you are looking for the creatine edge even if creatine has never worked for you before then no-xplode is probably the one. it can also help build muscle but even if it doesn't for you it is still worth it for the surge. i am very glad that i got it. very. serving size: 1 scoop (20.5g) servings per container: 40 amount per serving: calories: 36 -calories from fat: 0 total fat: 0g -saturated fat: 0g cholesterol: 0mg sodium: 150mg potassium: 75mg total carbohydrates: 9g -sugars: 0g protein: 0g vitamin b6: 25mg -(pyridoxine hcl) vitamin b12: 120mcg -(cyanocobalamine) folic acid: 400mcg magnesium: 360mg phosphorus: 500mg calcium: 75mg no-xplode proprietary blend: 20500mg (no-xplode contains a patent pending nutrient suspension matrix & efforsorb delivery system) no meta-fusion (patent pending) (l-arginine akg citral-m (citrulline malate) l-citrulline akg l-histidine akg rc-nos (rutacarpine 95%) gynostemma pentaphyllum (95% gypenosides) nad (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) muscle volumizing creatine matrix (patent pending) cem3 (creatine ethyl ester malate) 2cm (dicreatine malate) betapure (trimethylglycine) glycovol (glycocyamine) guanipro (guanidino proplonic acid) cinnulin pf (aqueous cinnamon extract) keto-isocaproate potassium ener-tropic xplosion (patent pending) l-tyrosine taurine endurlac (glucuronolactone) l-tyrosine akg methylxanthines (caffeine) mct's (medium chain triglycerides) vinpocetine 99% vincamine 99% vinburnine 99% phospho-electrolyte replacer calcium phosphate magnesium oxide potassium phosphate sodium phosphate glycerol hydrating polymers potassium glycerophosphate magnesium glycerophosphate glycerola stearat ",positive

" first off let me start by saying that i really like my summit watch. it is large (some may go so far to call it huge) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist and quite comfortable to wear. those with bad eyesight will still be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time barometric pressure altitude and compass. the numbers are quite big so they are difficult to miss. the altitude reading measures in increments of +/- 1 foot which is about as good as you can get. i like that. but what i really like about the highgear watches that i haven't seen in other brands which offer similar features is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be. no kidding this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny partly cloudy or raining. pretty dang nifty if you ask me. the barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather however after months of use i have to say that my little watch is way more accurate than my local tv weatherman. i'd say somewhere around 75% of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually are. not bad. it's a feature i would very much like to have on my suunto and casio models with similar functions. until then i'll rely on my trusty (and much cheaper) highgear summit. if you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass altitude and barometer functions before making that specific buy do some homework and wherever possible seek out a store where you can actually see the watches in person. being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase. find the best price and pull the model out and actually try it on before you buy. for me the highgear summit was a good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package try the highgear axis or possibly the more stylish but much more compact (and way more expensive) suunto observer. either way doing a little homework will pay off in the end. happy hiking and i hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product. good luck ",positive

" i have arthritis (psoriatic) diabetes high blood pressure heel spurs and osteopenia (a pre-osteoporosis state)and i'm 240lbs. a real grab-bag of conditions to deal with! i saw what happened when my mother broke her hip and i really didn't want to have that happen to me. but how to exercise? using a warm therapy swimming pool was about the only exercise i could do and that will not provide the weight-bearing exercise needed to re-form bone. just walking around is cheap but i'm a female and my neighborhood is not really well-lit and has gone downhill a bit too. i just didn't feel safe walking around at 2:am or whenever *i* was up for exercise. besides there were hazards like uneven pavement high curbs and all the issues of weather to deal with. i had seen the ads on tv for the gazelle line of exercise equipment and it seemed to be ideal for me. i could exercise my knees and hips in regular gravity conditions or add resistance if i needed to without any arthritis-taunting up and down impact on my joints. no more worries about where i was stepping and into what. i could exercise whenever i wanted and not disturb anyone in the neighboring apartments. i could go as far as i liked and wouldn't have to worry about being exhausted from going too far from home and not being able to make it back. so i got the gazelle and i love it! i chose this model (the power plus)for my use but also because my best friend is 340lbs and this will take up to 350lbs. from the way it is constructed - which is very strong and solid i'm not sure that's really it's upper limit. this is not some flimsy cheaply constructed rip-off. it does not move sway or walk when i use it. yet with the handles on the side i'm able to lift the back of the gazelle up onto the front wheels and move it fairly easily which really suprised me since it is such a heavy-duty machine. any downsides? it did have a small bit of squeaking at first but it never got to the point where i'd be worried that i was disturbing anyone. because it is built so solid it does command a bit of space. not too much but it is not a model that will fold up so you'll need to commit room for it and enough room for the swinging motion. i'd want to safety-fence off around it to protect pets and kids from getting too close when it's in action. over-all i am very pleased with this item! well done fitness quest ",positive

" there's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars because i think most people buy it for boats instead. so i'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car. in summary it works great. it's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty. i'm never going to jiffy lube again. it even works great on my lawnmower. using the extractor is very easy. just remove your dipstick insert the extractor's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan (it might take some practice to get a feel for this part). once everything is in place pump 10-20 times. this will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw. it takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts. that's also why i recommend the 6-liter model instead of the 2.5-liter one so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot. some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way. unfortunately i can't really speak to that because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate. however the consensus from stuff i've read on the internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method. because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor i always change my oil on time. previously i drove for thousands of miles past my due date because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient. the extractor should be used after the engine has been running. the oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up making the extractor more effective. also please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled. most mechanic shops will accept your old oil (i put it in a plastic orange juice container) just call ahead to make sure ",positive

" first off i need to tell you that i've carried a swiss knife since i was a kid. i have most of the styles. but this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason. for me since i don't fish i found more uses for this in the most unexpected area. the fish scaler tool is one that i would never use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly too much work. but this tool i have used more than any other on all my knives. i've used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights pick locks. to measure things (something you need more often than you think) to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher. since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it's perfect to scratch those areas one can't reach. that's not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which i use except for the absurd parcel hook. this tool is useless and yet victorinox continues to install it on many knives. the only useful task i've found for the hook is to tighten one's laces on my boots when i snow shoe. anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook? please post it if you have ",positive

" i've owned my first pair of big grip gloves for over three years now and they're still in great shape (for a time i was lifting four times a week). i only bought a second pair to keep in reserve in case harbinger discontinues them. the only down side for me is the finger length. the glove's fingers at least on my hands end right at the second joint and are mildly annoying when you bend you fingers until the gloves break in. after that though they're great ",positive

" i hate to feed into the mentality that causes knifemakers to hype their blades as tactical because the last thing we need to give lawmakers is another excuse to heroically protect us by banning the tools we carry. but the first and last thing i have to say about the ken onion tactical blur is that it is one fearsome knife. a curved blade would be suited to your usual cutting and slicing applications such as skinning mastodons and so on. this knife on the other hand has a chisel-like tanto point which is ideal for thrusting effortlessly through beef ribs or car hoods. it would be equally at home cutting up cardboard boxes linoleum flooring or metal garbage cans. technically this isn't a switchblade. switchblades are bad. we know this because our lawmakers have heroically protected us by effectively banning them at various levels. this is only an ordinary liner-lock knife with spring-assisted opening. but if i ever found a switchblade with the deployment speed and cutting power of the blur i'd say it was quite a knife. the blade is shaving-sharp from the factory and the handle is lightweight but sturdy aluminum with some kind of gritty sandpaper-like stuff glued on to give a better grip should the knife become slippery with any sort of fluid. use your imagination. i haven't tried shattering any cinderblocks with it yet but it's sturdy enough to use as a yawara stick in a pinch. folded the whole package can be palmed even in my small hands and feels much like a disposable lighter with a glandular problem. i don't even notice it in my hip pocket which is where it rides whenever i happen to be wearing pants. if walking around with something this fearsome seems too naughty for you remember a couple of things. one is that you can buy it from the wall for $55 and the wall would not sell naughty things to naughty people. another is that crimes to my knowledge are not generally committed with knives like these but with such evil implements as kitchen knives screwdrivers and whatever happens to be lying around near the crime scene. lastly you will probably not need a knife this fast and ferocious but if you do you will *really* need it. and you'll have it ",positive

" this is a nice sword for $35 (plus tax). when i removed the sheath there was some sort of goo on the blade (probaby so it wouldn't rust). this is a carbon blade so don't leave it in a moist closet for 1 or 5376 years(by then the rusted blade alone will be worth a fortune). just dont get the blade wet ok. you can rub a moist towel across it to get rid of the rust protector if you're going to use it often but that is pretty much all you can do to clean it without a special kit. please dont brandish this sword around like a bad actor in a kung-fu movie. you could realy hurt someone with the point of the blade. i think this is shipped over seas so dont challenge your friend to a violent battle the day after you buy this and you should be fine. blue dragon is actualy a japanese video game that no one bought. i think it was based on a part of final fantasy 2. i don't want to bore you with video games so i'll get to the point. put it on display dont cut your lawn with it dont play ninja with it and dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try to cut a solid object in half with it (prefrebly a tin can) because the cheap blade could fly off the tang and hurt you (or prefrebly your neibor) in the face. please don't throw the blade at your neibor either. p.s. i am not neil meislin i am his son daniel meislin. if you can't understand my numerous perenthesis i guess you're not smarter than a 5th grader.

" the dials/gages appear to be very good quality and look very nice. they are very accurate as far as i can tell in comparing them to my lacross clock/weather gage and the local weather reports and web reports. the hygrometer may be off by 2% but am not convinced this is true as yet and i can adjust it. i set the barometer to +1.1 for my 1050' above sea level. i wish the clock was not a loud tick tick tick. it is not that bad but i would rather not have that at all as my ears very easily pick up on things like that. the one thing i do not like is that i should have checked the dimensions of it. i am not sure if they were listed when i bought it. so check the size of what you think you life before you purchase. this one seems a little small. not the gages but the mounting board. it could be a little wider and a little taller. i also somehow messed up on buying one that had such a boring mounting board. i would have liked a beveled arch on the top or such. the wood is good quality and the varnish appears to be top notch. i don't mark down for this. i mark down for the size of the mounting overal as it could be taller and wider. not buy much but maybe an inch wider and 2' taller. overal i like it alot. i just did not realize how plane jane it was in mounting and size.

" you owe it to yourself to own a flashlight made using the cree xr-e led. it's roughly twice as bright as the currently comparable luxeon led. also the regulator circuitry keeps the light at a fairly constant level through the life of the battery (not all led flashlights have this feature). it's small enough to be put on a keychain yet puts out a powerful beam ",positive
" i already owned a fenix p1 which amazed me with the impressive light it threw from something so tiny. it was easily small enough to fit on my key chain and so it is always with me. even a great light source is useless if it's not accessible when you need it. i owned a surefire ultra which is a great flashlight but obscenely expensive. but you could feel the quality and knew it would last a few decades. i love the rear clicky button design and the 5 levels of light. i expected some similar design elements in this new fenix. i was disappointed to see that to switch to the different settings you have to screw the collar left right then left right again and so on. so if there is one setting you use most often you must go through the whole 5 turns just to get back to it next time. come on that's just stupid. i will keep it only to avoid the exchange hassle and it still is a good value considering the size and light output especially compared to the uberpriced surefires. but there is no comparison as far as construction or quality. so 4 stars is all i could muster for the crude setting selection method design and the adequate but toylike feel of the casing construction.

" i bought one of these lanterns three years ago at the local discount store. i have used it numerous times on camping expeditions. it outputs very bright light at full blast. the lantern is quick to light and the best part is it does not require matches. the only three issues i have with this lantern are: 1. sucks the propane. i also have the coleman fuel lantern and while it is not as bright it can go for a week of camping on one tank (5 cups) of fuel. 2. loud. this lantern is loud when burning. the above mentioned lantern is much quieter. 3. construction -- the fiberglass (?) base around the knob has disintegrated from my thumb rubbing it when trying to light the lantern. hopefully this will not affect the longevity of the lantern. i'd recommend it if you are looking for convenience and bright light but if you are looking for value go with the old dual mantle coleman fuel (pump up) lantern.

" had this device for 3 months absolutely love it! the chest strap you must wear in order to detect your heart rate takes a little time to adjust to but it is very accurate. the most useful feature offered that is not included in many heart rate monitor devices on the market is being able to keep track of the distance you ran the speed (max and average) and calories expended. this allows you to control your pace while running by speed or because some days your body may react differently to exercise and may fluctuate; you can change your training accordingly with the heart rate monitor function. you are also able to easily program the watch so that it will alert you once you've reached a target heart rate or time or speed and even resting rates laps etc. essentially letting you program your interval training. distance is very accurate once calibrated manually. never owned a gps based heart rate monitor before but i chose this the gps based hrm because i need reliability (according to some reports on gps based hrm the gps signal is weak when running in places with trees or tall buildings). besides if i get lost i figure the extra running can't hurt me = ",positive

" i purchased this knife for about $4 cheaper than its usual amazon listing price at amazon's friday sale. i had been looking at the kershaw knives for awhile and following an incident in my building's parking garage (woman accosted pocketbook stolen) it seemed like the perfect time to buy. the rainbow titanium-coating color might bother some men but i'm a woman so i don't mind the color of the knife. i would have preferred the black-on-black but this was too good a deal to pass up. the safety lock looks like it might slip out of safety easily but in two weeks time of regular wear/use i haven't had a problem. i flip the knife open often (heck it's fun) and i wear it regularly (what's the point of having it if you're not prepared to use it?). the thin attached metal belt clip is very sturdy and multipurpose (it looks similar to the metal clip on a writing pen). not only can i clip the kninfe just inside my slacks waistband but it clips easily to the inside leather pocket of my purse. the single finger flip-open mechanism is beyond belief - very easy to use exceptionally fast and accurate. the locking mechanism (keeps the blade in place) is extremely solid and has worked without flaw. when i'm walking anyplace suspicious by myself i hold the knife in the ready to flip open position in my hand held down at my side. the knife is nearly invisible in that position so i don't stand out as oh my god she's carrying a knife! however someone intent on a criminal act just might notice and avoid me altogether. great knife for personal safety. lastly like the other reviews point out these knives are sharp. i don't use mine to open letters boxes and typical pocket knife activities (i believe that would gum it up and slow the opening speed of the knife) so i anticipate the blade should have a good long life in my care.

" i work out at home using dumbells and a number of bodyweight exercises. my dumbbell collection had grown cumbersome and messy so i looked around for a way to organize these dumbells in my room and this rack was perfect. i did look at a number of racks both online and in rl but the majority were way over my budget had crippling shipping charges or were too limited in terms of their capacity to space ratio. i was just about ready to fabricate my own when i found this on amazon. after reading the reviews and crunching the numbers i decided to give this a shot. i'm happy to report this has completely solved my dumbbell storage problems. *** this rack arrived a couple of days before anticipated; with the use of a single crescent wrench i put it together without assistance in the space of an hour or so. well within 2 hours of opening the box it was in place and holding weights. it is solidly made of heavy gauge steel and quality welds covered in a tough tactile coating material. the construction method is of simple carriage bolt and nylon insert locknut assembly. it ships with rubber coverings for the feet and all orifices. *** the actual dimensions of this rack are 36.75 x 24 x 32 (w x d x h). add at least a foot to the height for the minimum workable usage space (for lifting the weights in and out). i have filled it's available space with sets of 10-50# dumbbells in 5# increments. for the past month it has held 540# and remained absolutely rock solid. from the feel of the thing it could hold easily twice this weight without issue. *** highly recommended for personal use or even tight boutique space.

" i used this for paintball on my military simulation a-5. i see other sights and i was worry about this since its cheaper. the red and green dot is much more visible then my brother in law more expensive bsa also. about the manufacture website it is a 40mm. dont know why they said 30mm. but like some sight the lens (both front and back) are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up/down/left/right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly. overall it worked great. i can tease/tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them.

" i'm serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout i can get by using these high-resistance water gloves. the unique velcro closure is a great improvement over other types which were a struggle to get on and off. wish they had a medium choice of size. they only make a s and a l. these gloves were a great find and the price was right ",positive
" this is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves my 2nd pair of this exact speedo aqua fitness glove. allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit. with other gloves water builds up inside the glove and if lycra-backed for example the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while. these speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger-holes. in addition the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves i have had. the palms hold up well as do the backs. i recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises ",positive
" overall this is a great little knife. it opens fast is very sharp and holds it's edge well and feels good in your hand. the liner lock is great. i have used some others and absolutely hated them because they were so hard to operate. this one is smooth as silk and located in a great position. very nicely designed. i did make a few changes which required going out and buying a torx screwdriver. firsti reversed the pocket clip because it came the facing the opposite direction i was used to on my spyderco knives. second the safety had to go. i found it slipped to the on position on its own so the knife did not open when you expected it to and was hard to disengage quickly. not because it was difficult to operate rather it is tiny and hard to find blind. if you like the safety though it definitely does prevent the blade from opening accidentally. speaking of safety...the knife arrives razor sharp. i opened my package and promptly sliced a finger badly enough to leave a scar. the tension that the blade is under requires some force to overcome and gives it a different feel when closing the knife from a regular lockback. be sure you fingers are nowhere near the blade. i am now in the habit of disengaging the lock and closing by pressing the back of the blade against my thigh ",positive

" this gun is pretty good but im not sure about the power being 300 fps and the battery takes too long to charge. although the clip only holds 30 rounds the gun is deadly accurate and very powerful when charged long enough. but please do not buy this gun for use as a sniper because the scope is a piece of s---. i recommend blowing it up. anyway to answer that person's question the cocking handle is just for looks. now back to my review. the scope does not have red crosshairs as i've heard people say and the sights are much better although you should tighten the screws. the foregrip on this gun is awesome as you can fold it up or down and is not too wobbly in the down position. overall this is a great gun and i would highly recommend it to any airsoft player and plus it's only $30 ",positive

" when i used lighter less dense mats they would sometimes bunch up or move around during flowing vinyasa practice. if my toe caught the mat the edge would flip over and require adjustment. also they did not cushion very well. in addition lesser mats wore out quickly and had to be replaced. when doing poses like the side-arm balance my foot would slip off the end of the regular length mat and i would fall out of the pose. with the extra-long manduka mat none of these issues is a problem. the mat is solid and dense and stays put on the floor no matter what i do. it cushions really well but because it is so dense it is no problem to balance or move on the mat (not mushy). i beat the daylights out of these mats and they still look great. durability is outstanding and they show no signs of wearing out. ever. the extra length allows me to move with confidence knowing i won't run out of room or slip off the mat. an additional benefit of the long mat is that it allows you to change your starting position on the mat somewhat so that the small area worn by your feet is not the same every practice. in other words you can spread the wear over a larger area to make it last even longer. the surface is plenty sticky for normal yoga and if you do a hot yoga class or sweat a lot you will likely want to have a towel anyway. no complaints about stickiness. as for weight it seems that if you are big enough to need an extra-long mat you are probably plenty strong enough to carry it around. it ain't heavy it's the best yoga mat i've ever seen.

" i thought the dvd was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising. it shows great technique and form. i used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of iowa so over the years i learned many of these pushup and workout techniques. pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape. i found myself to be too advanced for the power 10 workout so the video seemed like common knowledge. so for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great dvd focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent dvd . the dvd takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup. it then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion. with the dvd purchase i was hoping to find an exercise program approximately 30-45 minutes long that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time. i was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the perfect pushup into a nice timed workout. a workout that works my chest back arms abs and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time. something similar to a tae bo style video or other timed exercise videos. the power 10 workout isn't that type of video. it is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own. i recently wrote some emails to the body rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast effective workout routine that one could get at the gym but can do at home in 30-45 minutes with their perfect pushup. he seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully bodyrev builds on this dvd like they have for their other products.

" my daughter just entered 9th grade and joined the tennis team. i have played badminton for years and tennis is a fun sport and about the only sport i will do with her other than walking or biking. i bought her this racquet because i wanted something easy for her not too heavy and reliable. the salesperson at dick's sporting goods recommeded this one and i am happy to say that it has been great! she has been able to hit the ball and with some practice i can see her becoming more confident. in fact the other girls on her team are always asking if they can play with her racquet! i have been doing alot of reading and the racquet really does make a difference; one piece is better and this is a titanium racquet. this racquet has great shock absorption; i have rheumatoid arthritis and will not play with a racquet that is going to leave me in pain. i liked this racquet so much that i just bought a second one so my daughter and i can play with the same racquet. p.s....it comes in a nice case...and the wilson us open tennis balls are an excellent choice for a match ",positive
" we have purchased 3 of these tricycles in the past 2 years for our grandsons; 1 was a gift but the other 2 are kept at our home as i watch the boys daily. the boys ages 20 months and 3 yrs love to ride them with the streamers flying and the bell ringing. i love them because of the way they are built. the center of gravity is set very low to the ground making spills and tip-overs a thing of the past. the rubber wheels have a better grip than the plastic wheels of other brands too. (i had purchased a small plastic trike and the way the wheels would just spin in place was very frustrating to the boys.) the old-fashioned fenders on the wheels help keep little fingers from getting hurt and the wide step in the back seems to be useful when getting on or off. all in all a great trike ",positive

" i've been carrying and using these swiss army spartans (or similar model) for about 35 years. bought my first in germany and couldn't get along without it now. great quality and has just about everything you could want for daily use. it's small enough and light enough that it's comfortable to carry. doesn't have all the useless bell and whistles that you'd probably only use if you were a 12 year-old boy scout. only problem (mine not the knife's) is that i tend to lose one about every 6-7 years... so i bought 2 this time so as to have a replacement for the next time it grows legs and walks away. another great feature is the optional eyeglass screwdriver than can be purchased and fits neatly (via a threaded handle) into the corkscrew ",positive

" gotta say i love this step and even more so the deal: not only do you get the step but you also get four raising-blocks *and* a step-workout dvd -- all for under $50!!! i think that's a bargain compared to buying the pro-equipment (i think it was $70-80 for the pro step and $40-50 for two raising blocks plus $15 for a dvd... that's like $140-150!). the step *is* smaller than the steps you're probably used to from the gym but it's not *that* much smaller -- i would say it's about 25% shorter length-wise. it's gotta be though i mean it's an at-home step so they're making it more storable. i guess if you're a big person it might be a little frustrating at first but i don't see how you couldn't adjust to it. then again i'm 5'2 & petite so for me it's the perfect size! haha :p the dvd is pretty good. it's pretty simple basic stepping though so if you're an advanced stepper you'll probably get bored real fast. however it does get you to sweat a little so it's not a complete waste. if not for the stepping though keep it for the abs workout -- omg it's amazing!! for only 10 minutes it really makes you want to commit stomach suicide. haha which is a good thing because the next day your tummy is sore but flat. :) but really it's a good dvd especially for those lazy days that you know you need to workout but don't want to (at least not too hard). lol buy this kit it's a *great* deal and it'll get you in shape! : ",positive

" ***** this is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun. the designs of sigg's water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs. they are simply beautiful! i switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain. these do necessitate regular cleaning (i clean mine every day) but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun. sort of like my rings glasses and watch i now consider my sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design. yes all in a water bottle! sigg of switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. they are light durable and perfect for any activity. well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap. sigg bottles come with several different types of tops. i bought the screw top because i don't like sports tops and i don't mind unscrewing the top when i want a drink. it is totally leakproof which is important to me. the top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner. i get comments on it all the time what's that? i love it! the sports top version is ok; i just am not a fan as i don't feel like i can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top. however for convenience you might prefer it. for children there is a cap-type top. all are leak-proof. if you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your sigg bottle. sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6l and 1l in this style. i have both. i use the .6l for sports activities because they are smaller. when i won't have to carry the container i like the larger bottle. sigg also makes a smaller .3l bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people. you can buy siggs in alternative sizes too such as .75l .4l (for kids) .6l .5l. you can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5l size also. search amazon for the perfect size. pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style. the colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on amazon. they are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years. i consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value-wise for me. highly recommended. **** ",positive
" led headlights are getting better all the time. this little guy is a one watt luxeon led with very good power regulation. regulation means that the light gets the most from a set of batteries and keeps the light at a given brightness instead of dimming as the batteries weaken. the princeton tec eos has three brightness settings and a flash mode. i actually find the flash mode to be too slow to be useful on the bike and it flashes at full power but these are minor nits. i'd also prefer if the light used aa instead of aaa cells. so i guess there are two things i don't like about this light. but the positives far outweigh the negatives. the light is small and is supposed to be waterproof to one meter. (i don't ride under water so i haven't tested that feature!) it's easy to operate and the batteries are easy to change. the light pattern seems to be just right for my riding. i use this light on my helmet but it also comes with a handlebar mount. i run the light at the lowest power setting most of the time and that's fine for reading my bike computer or cue sheets. the middle setting is better for general riding spotting road signs and potholes and things like that. at the highest setting you get the brightest beam but of course that eats through the batteries quicker. i'm pretty sure the circuit in this light was designed by willie hunt a real guru in bike lighting circles. and yes i'm enough of a nerd that i actually keep track of things like that. anyhow the princeton tec eos is my latest favorite bike toy ",positive

" despite having some trepidation after reading the reviews of owners who had unpleasant experiences with the sg4 i bought it and am glad that i did. my experiences using the sg4 during play have been very positive even though on occasion the weather conditions have been so bad that i could only get a signal for some of the holes. the large screen allows the user to easily see each of the obstacles on a given hole and know the distance to them and the distance required to carry them. the sg4 also provides a more detailed view of each obstacle as well as the distances to the front edge center and rear edge of each green. for golfers who like to know the exact distance they hit each of their clubs the mark feature is marvelous. being able to have all of this valuable information available for 10 professionally measured courses and 5 personally measured courses is of significant value for golfers who play a number of different courses not only on a regular basis but also for courses being played for the first time. the sg4 also has a memory card slot for being able to download more courses when that service is offered in the future. i think the the downloading procedures on the sky golf web site are somewhat confusing but not very difficult to figure out and use with only a few minutes of effort. i know several low and mid-handicappers who love this device and i share their enthusiasm and opinion -- i am a high handicapper. i also own a bushnell pinseeker 1500 with slope and consider the sg4 to be a far superior tool to the bushnell. note: there is at least one additional cost that buyers will incur after they receive their sky caddie -- the subscriber fee for downloading courses for 1 year. the fees range from $30 for courses measured in one state that you designate to $80 for worldwide use ",positive

" for those who may be new to suunto they are wrist-top computers designed and manufactured in finland and are in use all over the world by hikers bikers and outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds. what makes the x-lander stand out are at first glance obviously its sheer size. let there be no illusions the x-lander is a mighty big watch. despite its size it doesn't feel as big as it looks though. the aluminum case is very light and quite comfortable too. the next thing you notice would be the huge amount of bells and whistles packed into such a small device. #1. an accurate altimeter. this is an invaluable tool for the avid hiker and biker. one thing you must be ready to do is remember to adjust it daily. find out what the altitude is and set the watch before you begin your trip and then at the end of the day you need to make note of where you stopped (which you can do with the internal recording function) and properly adjust it before setting out the next day. this is not a flaw every single altimeter watch i am aware of is exactly the same. #2. barometer. i found it correct at least 75% of the time which is more than i can say for the local tv weatherman. this includes a thermometer as well which in order to be accurate must be removed from your wrist for at least 15 minutes in order not to get a false reading due to lingering body heat. #3. digital compass. this is truly one amazing feature by the way. once you calibrate it (which you may need to do weekly) you will never be lost -- especially if you know how to use a map. #4. it tells pretty accurate time too believe it or not. it also comes with an alarm a countdown and a stopwatch. suddenly its size now makes sense huh? i happen to like big watches. i don't exactly know why but i just do. if i were to have any complaint whatsoever the one thing this watch is lacking is exactly what they have included in the much less expensive vector: a tiny little bubble which helps you to level out the watch in the compass mode for a more precise reading. the reason why may have to do with the fact that the x-lander is mineral crystal and the vector is plastic but either way it'd be nice to have. i am very impressed with just about everything associated with suunto and their fantastic line of what they call wristop computers. if size really does matter to you well you may wish to go with the observer or maybe the x6hr (which does everything the x-lander and observer can do plus it has a built-in heart-rate-monitor) both are smaller than the x-lander vector yachtsman and many other suunto models yet still offers a lot -- but keep in mind with the smaller size comes the bigger price. factor all that into your purchase plans and once again if at all possible do not buy until you have the chance to see some of these (or any) models in person. that will make a huge difference in how happy your purchase will end up being...and good luck!

" i recently got into gymnastics so i started looking for a leotard for someone with real curves. i'm 5'6'' and 180lbs and the xl fits me great. it has long sleeves which is great for the wintertime and i don't have to feel self consciousness about my fat hanging out there because it covers it up. it's cut low enough so that i'm not getting wedgies and i can do handstands without worrying if my workout shirt got un-tucked. it's not flashy so i don't look like a 10 year old in a fat 26 year olds body. it's nice and plain gets the job done and i'm sure the others at they gym thank me for covering up for goodness sakes ",positive

" i bought this bike for my boyfriend for christmas. it arrived in about 3 days rather than the expected 5-7. we set it up on about half an hour. it comes with a small wrench that is perfect for the set up--i read an other review (prehaps on a different bike) that you need a cresent wrench however for this bike you don't. he uses it every night and i use it a few times a week. it's silent and nothing has broken on it as of yet...granted i've only had it for a month. i would definitely recommend this product ",positive
" i knew i wanted a bowflex and couldn't decide between the models available. this model offers the most range in exercises and still has the ability to fold up small enough to be able to set up a double air mattress in my spare/exercise room for a weekend guest. this product came in several large boxes and is best assembled by a two person team (a husband/wife team worked for us). this is the first exercise equipment i have been consistent with. it is fun to use and takes no effort to change between sets. i also have the ab attachment. love it ",positive

" after reading the horror stories of the assembly process/instructions i was a little worried. myself and my 12 yr old daughter put it together in about 3 hrs without issue. all parts were included instructions were clear she did the step check off's the base took 400lbs of sand vs the 375lbs stated in the instruction ",positive
" after reading the previous reviews and noticed the bad comments about the instructions i took that into considerations and purchased it anyways. nobody was really talkin bad about the board. most of us have the urgency of putting it together w/out reading the instructions and simply just looking at the drawings. you have to approach this one differently. i went ahead and borrowed a friend of mine and paid him with cold beverages because i defintely agree that you need at least 2 people to put this together. the instructions although not as detailed did mention that you must read the entire instructions carefully to assemble this item failure to do so can delay your assembly because you have to disassemble and re-assemble again. finally it took us 4 1/2 hrs to complete the assembly and based on my experience it wasn't that bad at all. i only wish they added spare washers/nuts just in case you lose it. once its installed i added water to it and let me tell you. its supposed to be portable but w/ the base filled its pretty heavy. the board has a better rebound than other cheap boards out there but its not like the ones at the indoor gym. 50 is adequate for a home use but you better have the apace for this. the base takes alot of room. the ability to move the height up/down is as advertised. i can do it with one hand. very nice!!! i measured it from the rim to the floor and its accurate based on the height you adjusted to. one thing i found out just now. this slam-it rim you are not allowed to hang on it or it will cause you your warranty. i know because lifetime answered my question i emailed out. they do not have weight limits on these rims so do not attempt to hang on it. i defenitely recommend this if your shopping for one.

" i'm 26 and i'm having a blast on this board! it's much more accessible than snowboarding and surfing because you can just grab your board and go! i take mine to a local tennis court for the smooth surface. they recommend using small hills and stuff but honestly stopping or slowing down is pretty much impossible on a decent incline so i prefer to stay on flat land. its amazing how long you can stay on the board without even setting a foot on the ground! the board seems to be constructed fairly well. i've gotten to the point where i can some pretty advanced turns by shifting my weight effectively its really fun trying to master it. i'm curious if the ripstik (competitor board) is better constructed since its made by razor and they might have put more money into the design. anyways i've had mine for about 2 months and the wheels are definately showing a lot of wear. i'll most likely have to replace them soon. i'm kinda happy that you can use any rollerblade wheels instead of some proprietary wheels. that enables you to look for good deals on some wheels. i'd also look around for the best deals on these boards. i got mine at a sports authority on sale for $80 after having seen one at an fao on my visit to las vegas for $130. so if you're a fun-loving adult who likes cool new ways of moving along i'd definately recommend this! it's addicting ",positive

" love this backpack it's been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well while protecting the contents well laptop included. the outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there and still fit under an airplane seat. love the two water holders on the outside. love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner compass or whatever. the support is great you'll barely feel its there and if you do just use both straps and then strap the front for great support. the pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens but thats quite minor. my only con is that the outside two pockets have gotten stuck twice already. i am now on my third backpack(gotta love rei's return policy). hopefully this one will last as i have yet to find a better more complete backpack. update 1/30/2007 - third backpack third zipper to get caught time to return again. i wish i could change the scale down to 2 stars : ",positive

" i am very happy with my choice. it is just the right size nicely finished with glossy black paint installs in a minute. usage is very convenient: it has that perfect click-into-place property: you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the stand position. to hide it when you are ready to go just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame. it does the job perfectly and it feels great ",positive

" i've never been a fan of propane stoves. they always seemed flimsy made for those toy-sized backpacking pots and pans and potentially dangerous - until now. after two weeks of rv-ing the fold 'n go has become a welcome addition to our set up. it is very sturdy and seems extremely well made. the wide separation of the two burners and heavy-duty pot supports allow for two large heavy fry pans and/or stock pots at one time. few stoves of any kind can handle simultaneous large pots. and it seems very stable when set on a table. and because it folds in half and becomes its own carry-case even though it handles such large tasks it's easy to carry and takes up very little storage space. it also has an instant start feature - you just turn the nob and then press a button and that's it. you're ready to cook. and after you're done clean up is a snap. unlike other stoves where you have to take them all apart to try and get at that nasty spattered grease this one is pretty much all sealed - just take the pot supports off wipe off underneath flip the pot supports over to store inside and then fold 'n go! it's great to get cooking moved outside the rv - especially for things like frying bacon or cooking anything that gives off a lot of steam. and because our meals seem to entail usually one or the other we plan on getting an extension hose off our main propane tank to run this frequently in the future.

" i was spending the day at home with a cold. the doorbell rang. at my doorstep was a large box. already? i just ordered it a few days ago. i shrugged on a jumper and hauled the surprisingly light (it's only 52 pounds) box up the stairs. a sharp knife a pair of nail clippers thirty minutes and several small drifts of white packing material snow later i had my extreme pilates put together. on first impressions the mat graphic is cheesy and the frame looks flimsy. however this isn't just a pilates trap table: the leg spring hooks are placed further back than they are on studio quality equipment and are less likely to get in the user's way. the push through bar won't drop if you let go of it because the metal is engineered not to slide. there are warning stickers to use the safety strap on the push through bar. overall this is a safer machine than the original. when you try to use it though there are a few problems: i'm 5'4 and the mat is too short if you want to roll down to the floor. the springs are light and i would suspect that replacing them with heavier ones might overload the strength of the frame. it's not clear which springs are the leg springs. the lack of clips is just silly. that said i can do everything i can do on a trap table. i did the cat swan and saw with the push through bar leg circles with the springs chest expansion and roll down with the bar and even the magician's series to finish. that kink in my shoulder that only goes away with the push through bar started to work itself out. i could hear the springs (real springs not bungee cords!) all was (briefly) right with the world. this is an amazing piece of equipment for the price. three caveats: not for taller men; it's just too small. not for serious athletes; not enough resistance. not for people with children if you can't lock it away; springs are not safe for the little ones to play with.

" i have had many backpacks for school and am always left wanting more space. i like to have different places to put different materials. this gives me the opportunity to do so. i like the fact that i can put my ipod in a section that is not likely to recieve the weight of the many books i use. i would say that the area where you hold the smaller items such as pens and calculators is nice. you have dividers where you can hold many different things. overall this is the best pack for school i have come across ",positive

" my kids got these from grandpa. they love them! they're fun to bowl with in a dark room. we've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light. the problems: the clip is pretty hard to operate even for an adult. also the plastic base broke on each of our lights (in different places) so now they're clip-less. they're still well-loved and well-used by the little guys though. i recommend these lights but be careful w/ the bases ",positive
" with the birth of our first child there were tons of little toys lying around all the time from teethers to rattles stuffed lovies and blocks. the traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside how sturdy it was and how much our baby loved looking at it! with bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin there is even a fold out flap with a play space and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket. the fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble shingles. this was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips. best of all there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside! it is soft and collapsible yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys. it can be very gently machine washed but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy. i gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby's toys. i give this 5 stars without hesitation; affordable and totally functional ",positive
" we have had the 438 for over a year and it has been outstanding. i started using an elliptical at the gym and still do but the convenience of having this at home is perfect. construction is top notch and the workout is oh so quiet. the workout monitor keeps track of every workout by user and has such features as fitness test recovery and many workout profiles to keep you challenged. what started out as a purchase for my use is now also used by my wife and daughter. i guess they had to try it after i continued to rave about it. time flies while you are on the 438. best of all this unit actually gets used. if you are going to buy one piece of home exercise equipment... look no further.

" i've owned three pairs of these so far and they're easily the best gloves i've ever used. i had previously only used unpadded gloves and the padding in the palm seemed a little thick at first. the padding does make it more difficult to get a solid grip in some exercise machines that also have large rubber grips on them (lat pulldown bars for example) but that's the trade off for excellent support and protection when using the gloves on machines with uncovered metal grips. i found these gloves to be more durable than the other non-padded harbinger gloves i've worn. the gloves can be safely washed and air dryed as advertised. my only complaint with regard to wear is that the unreinforced leather where my thumb meets the padding in the palm seems to wear out before the rest of the glove. every pair i have owned will eventually wear a hole in this particular area.

" quick shipping - i received this bike in 4 days (using free super saver shipping) and it was even over a holiday! the bike comes in one large box with many pieces. my husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour. it looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble. the bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas. it is also very quiet - you have to listen closely to even hear the bike. the resistance goes from 1 to 8 (one being the easiest to eight being the hardest). my husband is an avid road biker and 8 could be too easy for someone looking for a really hard ride (like riding the equivalent of up-hill). the bike offers basic functions that are displayed very large. the display is easily toggled through. the heart rate monitor picks up okay but don't buy the bike based off of that function because it's not totally reliable. all in all a great buy! i injured my back and was looking for a workout that would be good on my back. the seat is uncomfortable (and i am petite- i would imagine it would be very uncomfortable if someone was larger. but for the price you can't beat it ",positive

" this is one of the best weightlifting gloves that i have found so far!! i like it so much that i've bought a few pairs. these have very supportive wrist wraps that are adjustable to secure your wrist during lifting - to help prevent injury. the rest of the glove is terrific. it is thicker around the palm and fingers so it provides excellent cushioning for those heavy lifts. i have not had one blister or redness since i've started using these gloves and i've been using them for over a year now. they are extremely comfortable. after a year of use my gloves are still in perfect condition too. i've tried other brands and the others tend to have thinner material around the palm and fingers and this causes redness and blisters so what's the use of using them? on the other hand this valeo ocelot wrist wrap weightlifting glove is perfect in every way!! has support comfort and it looks great. i have the orange pair (glow) and i get lots of compliments at the gym too about how great they look. well worth every penny. way to go valeo!

" we have a slightly sloped yard so i was hesitant about getting a trampoline. we tried it and it works fine! my kids love it! of course like any other toy they take it in spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months. i was also concerned at first about them falling off of it. i almost bought the enclosure to go with it but i decided to wait and see how high they jumped etc. this trampoline is so small they really can't get a lot of air so they don't do flips and other dangerous tricks. it's also very low to the ground. i am glad now that i didn't get the enclosure. we don't really need it. i would recommend this trampoline for younger kids. the weight limit is 120 lbs so it can't support larger kids. also since it is so small we only let our two preschoolers jump together. when we have guests over it's one at a time. i love it that my kids want to be outside so much. this is better money spent than on video games in my opinion ",positive

" we were having trouble deciding between this rower and the kettler coach. this one was available thru amazon but the kettler had to be purchased thru merchantila which has a horrible reputation. so we went with this model. i couldn't be more pleased. where it was manufactured was not listed so i contacted lifecore. i had a response within 24 hrs. made in taiwan but don't let that put you off. this is not a china quality product. it's very sturdy. smooth and silent. the preset programs vary not only in intensity but time. some are 10 minutes. some half an hour. haven't tried them all. four programs are for you to set. ordered it on a monday. here by friday. my husband had it set up before i got home from work. he did complain that the instructions weren't well written. but he never complained about actually putting it together. must not have been too difficult. all tools were included. you can also set your workout by time distance calories and strokes. while checking merchantila's bbb rating i also checked lifecore's. they have no complaints. that also helped us decide. i love this machine. i'm sorry i didn't get a rower sooner ",positive
" the bowflex is one of the most amazing machines i have ever used. with its range of exercises and a little creativity on your part you can do just about any exercise you want to do. i completely recommend this if you don't have the time to go to the gym or if you just really enjoy working out at home. one disclaimer don't think you can get the same results you can get from free weights. if you are an avid free-weight lifter you can get your kicks out of maxing the leg press and perhaps even maxing the bench. the powerrods have a tension that is proportional to the amount of bend you give them. thus if you do an exercise with 100 pounds of resistance but only move the power rods through their first half of bend you aren't getting 100 pounds of resistance. also when you extend the arms of the pulleys to do the wide grip bench you decrease the amount of bend in the rods to the point where even if you bend them all the way you aren't getting full resistance. don't get me wrong i love this thing; i've had mine for the past 2 years and it is amazing. i work out twice a day for about 45 minutes to an hour each session only because i don't have the time to make it to the gym. get this if you are very serious about workout out at home and don't have a lot of space to fit other equipment. make sure you have a positive attitude going into the lifting programs. experiment with ideas on different exercise movements. more than anything this piece of equipment is a blast to use have fun with it ",positive
" i'm a small person not a bodybuilder and hated free weights. however i realized as i got older that i really needed to do some type of strength training. i'd been thinking about a bowflex and after looking at the literature decided i wanted an ultimate. i purchased a used one and don't recommend that route since the seller lost some of the parts and delivered a damaged machine (long story). i was able to order the missing pieces from bowflex but it took forever to get them. once i was able to use the machine i absolutely loved it. it's especially good for me since i'm usually alone when i work out and was concerned about injury with free weights or other types of exercise/weight machines. additionally due to a neurological problem i had little extensor function in one hand. using the bowflex i've been able to rebuild some of the muscle tone and would highly recommend this for anyone who needs physical therapy requiring weights. i use this faithfully every day alternating between arm exercises and shoulder exercises. it's a pleasure to use and not at all tedious. i think i probably could have done with one model under this since i never use the leg equipment. nevertheless i'd recommend buying this item new from the manufacturer. it's pricey but well worth the money ",positive

" i bought this on somewhat of a whim because i've been wanting get a little more in shape (got a little bit of pudge going on) and i realized the hardest part of motivating myself to work out was actually getting ready and going out to the gym.. time was somewhat of a factor as well. so i ordered this a few days ago because i read some reviews on here and it looked like the price was right. set it up earlier today; the quality of the parts is basically no worse or better than i'd expected.. think of it as a stripped down eliptical machine. setting it up was fairly easy but some of the instructions were a bit unclear. threw on some running sneakers and got on and i've got to say the feel/motion of this thing is really strange at first. unless you are a ballet dancer or gymnist with really good balance be prepared to look like an idiot on this thing for a little while because like it's name it is completely freestyle. it's range of motion and rhythm is all up to you. have you ever been on a ski lift at a mountain and had the urge to swing your skis forward and back in unison just because it gives you that tiny feeling of being thrown off balance? you might start unintentionally doing that for a few minutes on this thing (it's actually kind of fun but of course there's not much of a workout factor doing it). after about 10 minutes i started to get the motion down. it was pretty fun once i got the hang of it but i agree with other reviews it does make your feet sore... might try putting some foam on the footplates ",positive
" just 3 weeks ago i came here looking at reviews for the tony little's gazelle freestyle and read mixed reviews. however most were encouraging and i thought it sounded like the thing for me. i have now used the gazelle for less than 2 weeks and have already seen results! this is no lie -- i lost 2 inches in the waist 2 in the hips 2 in the abdomin and 2 in the thighs. i'm just as freaked as you may be but i'm telling you this is the honest truth! i was discouraged that i had not been seeing any results on the scales lately and needed to change things up so i'd see something move again. this gazelle did it for me. at this time i'm only up to 30 minutes a day and 1-3/4 miles... i'm still a work in progress. but these results are no lie. just think how much results i'll see when i can stay on longer! they advertise it as a low impact overall machine and it truly is. i have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia so i was looking for something i could do that wouldn't hurt me. i can honestly say i get a full workout on this machine... oh i forgot to mention also 1 inch in the arms. so that's a total of 9 inches in 2 weeks. this is the best machine i've ever used (we also have an exercise bike and ab lounge which i've not used in the last 2 weeks at all cause i was getting such a good workout on the gazelle) and i'm so happy i found it. and i thank you people users of amazon.com for coming here and posting your reviews and making it easy on me to know which machine to buy. mine is the exact picture above and folds up. i also love that feature. it's not a problem to just fold it up and lean it against the wall beside my bed after each use. therefore i've still got lots of walking space beside my bed. ",positive
" i was a little skeptical about the gazelle at first because it didn't look like you could get a work out from using it - but i was wrong! but let's start at the beginning: it's pretty easy to set up - the directions on the dvd were great and i could do it all myself. i was really excited to use it so i hopped right on (i'm already used to ellipticals) and enjoyed a great workout. i was sweating and after watching the training dvd i worked my upper body and lower body. i look forward to using it tomorrow. now i don't have to drag myself to the gym. i can work out at home! downsides: it does squeak but some wd40 or petroleum jelly should fix that. it folds up but it's not extremely portable. i have it in my living room currently. all in all i recommend this product. i can feel the toning and with good diet and weight training you'll see results ",positive

" this was bought for my boyfriend and i to sleep on when he comes to town. it is very comfortable and there is a lot of room for us! it loses a tiny bit of air during the night but not so much that it is on the floor or anything. it is a little difficult to get up off of it in the morning because it is like a water bed. if you get a good wave going you can jump right up! the other problem i had with it is that it makes me sweat. even with the covering and a sheet. i am still sleeping on vinyl and so i sweat. not a lot but it is noticeable in the morning. i am happy with the fact that it holds a lot of weight too because i am a big woman and my boyfriend is a big man. it holds us with no problem. it was over all a very good purchase and i am happy with it ",positive

" when the product came i realized that it wasn't what i was looking for in a fanny pack but i was impressed with its rugged construction. i needed a pack to walk around disney world and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy. i like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day. the water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle. plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another dasani. unfortunately you can't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn't stop a regular 16 oz. job from slipping passed. so i'm returning mine but if your looking for non breakable wide mouthed water bottles in a rugged waistpack then this is for you. ps for some reason the blue one is cheaper at least when i bought it ",positive
" the bar itself is exactly what i wanted. the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars is because of the troubles i had on the purchase. the bar arrived literally hanging out of the box the box was really really torn up. the collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar needless to say the bar was useless untill i finally found some collars on ebay. amazon refunded all my $$ as soon as they were aware of the problem. overall the bar is great ",positive
" i have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years. the price has been gradually coming down each year. i was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at amazon of all places. these fit well adjust easily and are extremely durable. i swim 6 days each week and i can easily get over a year of use from each pair. typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools. keep them stored safely so the lenses don't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase ",positive

" i got this accessory with my door gym and i like it. but when they say this is an efficient accessory - they mean it. it simply rests on the narrower neutral grip posts of the door gym. the door gym has multiple grip areas but two of them are perpendicular to the rest of the bar for narrow neutral grip chin ups. the broad reach bar is wide with downward grips (like lat pull down bar in a gym). anyway this works fine if you have the faith to try it the first time and prove to yourself it won't roll off because your body weight has it pinned on the posts. it has foam covering that adheres to the foam on the door gym posts. it will not roll easily but it does a little. i think it is safe for adults who understand how to use it. do not give it to kids younger than about 15 (in my estimation) because some of them are too likely to play with or misuse it and get hurt. even though this thing works and does what you want a broad bar to let you do i deducted a point in the rating because i don't think they were up front in explaining exactly what it is and is not ",positive

" i've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years. all i wanted was a thin small and light knife and i got it. the blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example. i have had the vary tip break a couple times but it's because i was doing something foolish with it (like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ;) ). it's not the best it's not the worst but can compete with ether witch is the best in my opinion. shortly after i bought it the speed safe spring broke eehhh who cares it opens fine without. it's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface. it's vary thin profile is comfortable and i sometimes can't tell if i have it with me or not. it has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones (means no binding up even when in need of oil). the frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time. my favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down. i chose henge down so it's ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket. if you want nice quality and availability for the price kershaw is worth looking at ",positive
" the knife is sleek and has a great profile. i love the speedsafe function on it. the blade lock is a bit stiff but i suppose that's just so it doesn't slide open on accident ",positive
" i purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero ... the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it doesn't reset. i like the fact that i can open the lid and read the led without taking it off. my only problem is the little leash ... it came with both a plastic and a metal clip. the plastic clip has lost it's springiness and i'm sure will stop working soon; but at least i have the metal clip to fall back on ",positive
" this pedometer is easy to set up and use. i tested its accuracy at the local highschool track by walking a 1/2 mile and sure enough my pedometer read 1/2 mile. the clip is sturdy i haven't had any problem with the device falling off. the leash is a good extra - if it did fall off it wouldn't hit the ground. my doctor gave me a goal of 10000 steps per day so i wear this all day long. it is light and i don't notice i am wearing it throughout the day. the only downfall to this device (as is probably true with others)is that your stride is measured for walking so when you are running or doing other cardio activity (elliptical) it doesn't accurately measure your distance. since your stride is longer during a cardio activity (running) and the device is measuring your walking stride the distance measurement falls short. however the actual number of steps taken is still accurately measured. i suppose you could adjust the setting to a running stride when running to bridge this gap ",positive
" i take a ringside boxing class at my gym and everyone bought these gloves and really likes them. i ordered them from online because it was the only place i could find a size small. i am very happy with them. they offer excellent wrist support and protection for your fingers. i really like the bar in the palm to help you grip when making a fist. they do tend to leave your hands a little black after sweating in them but it washes right off. the only thing bad i have to say is that after only a couple of times of using them the threading started to come apart at the pinky finger. it can be sewed up but you shouldn't have to do that so soon after the purchase. no one else in my class seems to have had this problem. i still gave them 4 stars because i have a hunch that the threading isn't a common problem and i love them otherwise ",positive

" for the price this low-end home gym is generally able to do the things i wanted a cheap home gym to do. however there are a few issues you need to consider before buying it. the biggest issue is ergonometric - this unit is not designed to be used by anyone over perhaps 5'10 or 5'11. i'm 6'1 and this creates problems for me. i have to find work-arounds to use a unit designed for people smaller than me. the problem is that form is very important when doing the exercises (when you don't pay attention to form you either reduce the effectiveness of the exercise or risk injury) and finding work-arounds sometimes compromises your form during the exercise. there are also a few quality issues but these were not entirely unexpected considering the price of the unit. it would have been nice if the bench padding were a little better but its adequate. the two most annoying quality issues involve the plate bars (the bars that hold the weights). this first issue was with the plate bar on the lat tower (cable) unit. it wasn't level. this means the weights keep trying to fall off one side as you put them on. the second issue is also with the plate bars. the unit is designed to accommodate standard plates (small holes in the middle) or olympic plates (big holes in the middle). a sleeve is included with the unit that slips over the standard size plate bar that enables one to use olympic plates (big holes). however the outer diameter of the sleeve is slightly smaller than standard olympic size so an olympic size spring collar (to hold the weights on the bar) is too big and doesn't work. i went down to home depot and bought wood clamps to hold the plates in place. kind of a pain but functional (just another work-around). if you buy this unit you probably want to go with standard plates (small hole) rather than olympic plates (big hole). so i put this at 4 stars because for this price you really can't expect too much and it generally delivers what i expected a cheap home gym unit to do - with the one caveat: persons over 5'10 should try to find a home gym designed for taller people. since only 5% of the us population is over 6 feet tall manufacturers tend to design for smaller people. if you're tall good luck on that search ",positive

" ***** this is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun. the designs of sigg's water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs. they are simply beautiful! i switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain. these do necessitate regular cleaning (i clean mine every day) but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun. sort of like my rings glasses and watch i now consider my sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design. yes all in a water bottle! sigg of switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. they are light durable and perfect for any activity. well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap. sigg bottles come with several different types of tops. i bought the screw top because i don't like sports tops and i don't mind unscrewing the top when i want a drink. it is totally leakproof which is important to me. the top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner. i get comments on it all the time what's that? i love it! the sports top version is ok; i just am not a fan as i don't feel like i can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top. however for convenience you might prefer it. for children there is a cap-type top. all are leak-proof. if you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your sigg bottle. sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6l and 1l in this style. i have both. i use the .6l for sports activities because they are smaller. when i won't have to carry the container i like the larger bottle. sigg also makes a smaller .3l bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people. you can buy siggs in alternative sizes too such as .75l .4l (for kids) .6l .5l. you can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5l size also. search amazon for the perfect size. pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style. the colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on amazon. they are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years. i consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value-wise for me. highly recommended. **** ",positive

" i was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged/rusty. the only problem i had was the bar on the rear-bottom wouldn't fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in. i tried really hard to get it in but it just wouldn't budge. luckily i could get the screw in on the other end so it is relatively secure. the bike is a bit wobbly when your riding - now i don't know if this is because of my problem with the bar or because that's just the way it is. but i don't feel like it's going to fall apart or tip over or anything. over all this is a really nice bike. the price is absolutely the best for what you're getting - especially if you choose the free super saver shipping. i got mine about a week from the day i ordered it. i don't think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price. most recumbent bikes at this price don't offer any kind of resistance what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor. it is really quiet - i can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the tv up too loud. the seat is a bit uncomfortable but it's not that big of a deal considering the price ",positive

" the bike arrived in fine condition no problems with bent or rusty parts like other people have reported. it was really easy to assemble. once i had assembled it i tried it out and found that it made a really annoying noise as the wheel went around - as if the gears were scraping against something. so i undid all the screws (a pain) and opened the plastic-enclosed base. there was a bracket that was meant to hold the pulse wires out of the way but the adhesive on it had worn off or something and it was just kind of hanging and would interfere with the gears. so i taped it to the side closed the plastic up and that was that. since then the bike has worked really well. i wish there was more ability to move it back - it is a good length for me but i can see how someone taller could have trouble with it. the seat is not terribly comfortable which gets to be a problem on longer rides but it's fixable with a pillow or cushion. the console is great - has all the information displayed all the time. plenty of resistance. overall there are some problems with it but for under two hundred dollars i suppose i can't complain too much. definitely worth the money ",positive

" great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym. it's heavy and very dense very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym's. heavy duty takes dropped dumbbell punishment and resists damage/cuts. use a drywall t-square as a guide and put a new blade in a box cutter. take several passes to cut it and take your time. it cuts straight and square for a professional look. i will definitely buy these again when i get a bigger room for the gym ",positive

" i purchased this for christmas for my 8 year old son to play with. it was $329 with free shipping compared to $450 at the local sports store. the finished product looks great appears to be rugged and stable and is quite easy to adjust. i only gave it 4 stars because assembly was not easy and i am mechanically inclined. practically all the holes needed to be drilled or reamed out in order to accept the bolts and the directions were ambiguous. it was a 4 hour assembly with filling the base with screened sand really taxing my patience. but the smile on the 8 year old's face was well worth the aggravation. on a side note i ordered 70% of my christmas shopping from amazon with everything except this arriving before the estimated delivery date (everything else shipped ups). they shipped this via dhl which never delivered the package. i had to drive 120 mile round trip to pick it up at the dhl facility and take time off of work the friday before christmas to retrieve my son's primary gift. i emailed amazon requesting $70 credit to reimburse me for my time and gas which they did in a few days. this was an oversized package that i assume ups would not accept. nonetheless their choice of shippers reflects on amazon as a company.

" i've worked out with cathe for about 6 months now and i have to say this is one of my favorite workouts. it combines cardio with upper and lower body in a 60 minute circuit workout. the cardio bursts are short but intense- expect to jump do power 15's fast feet shuffles spike lunges etc. lower body work - well let's just say i hope you like to do leg press- since you'll be doing it - a lot. there are a total of 6 sets of leg press - on each leg. also cathe inserts some static lunges and squats among other moves. she does hover squats with pulses of 16 over the high step- your quads will be feeling the burn there! arm work includes typical weighted and non-weight work such as tricep dips off the high step push ups bicep curls overhead extension etc. overall if you're looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles this is the workout for you. beginners beware- you can modify certain exercises (i use dumbbells instead of a barbell) - but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser ",positive

" you'll never mistake the shake flashlight for a powerful spotlight but that's not it's purpose. it's a niche item the perfect flashlight to stick in your car trunk or emergency bag and then forget about it. with no batteries or bulbs you know it'll always be ready for use whenever you need it. when it first arrives you'll need to shake it hard for a couple minutes to charge it up but just think of it as aerobic exercise. once it's charged it provides sufficient light to read instructions or maps determine colors of wires or diagrams and keep you from stumbling around in the dark. i was surprised by just how bright the shake flashlight was after about 3 minutes of hard shaking. the only improvement i can think of would be to have a small diode glow when the flashlight is turned off. when the light begins to dim a few shakes will keep the light strong enough to use. unlike the previous reviewer i had absolutely no problems with delivery - i ordered it on 12/26 (non-expedited mail) and it arrived on 12/30 exactly as described ",positive

" i am very impressed with the f4. it is very easy to use and a good basic heart rate monitor. it is easier to program than my f6 and it fits better. polar makes the best hr monitors and it works with all their chest straps - coded and uncoded and even with ones that are not from them. i have vision fitness exercise equipment and the strap works with their hr function. sometimes i strap the watch to the equipment so i can read while i exercise and i'm able to continually see the hr without constantly changing the view on the equipment. the color is more of a gray color than an ice blue so it goes with just about anything you wear. i'm really looking forward to using this unit while i go out and do my walks this spring! i can't imagine buying anything else but polar. this is my third watch and all three of them are still working well ",positive
" i love this watch! it's easy to use. it's also a very basic watch. it gives your heart rate zone and calories burned. it's very nice for what it is supposed to do. if you're looking for a watch with a lot of bells and whistles this is not the one for you. it looks nice and it's not too bulky. the only reason i would have gotten the f6 is because it says it has something that prevents cross talk (interference with others wearing a heart monitor watch. there are three of us where this same exact watch in my cycling class and we've never had a problem with cross talk. as the other reviews said there is no backlight. would recommend ",positive

" i bought this from lifeline recently and it has been an excellent addition to my home gym equipment. i'm not a person who travels back and forth to a gym each day. i also do not like paying an arm and a leg for expensive pieces of workout equipment that eventually become expensive coat racks. this workout solution is about as low tech as it can get. i agree with the previous reviews below--you could almost make this one yourself. it consists of a strip of mesh webbing--like seatbelt material; two adjustable quick locking clips; handles made of webbing and plastic tubes; and another piece of plastic tubing that locks the jungle gym into place when the door is shut. the equipment is simple but sets up in seconds. the clips adjust quickly and are incredibly secure. it's so simple--but it really works. the emphasis of the instruction sheet and the dvd that came along with it is in upper body strength. you can do chin ups--by regulating height you can work up from lifting part of your body weight to full body weight. for me this was the best part of the jungle gym. my chin ups/pull ups have improved remarkably by using the device. body rows push ups and fly push ups are also possible. using the jungle gym pushups take on a new dimension with a fuller range of motion (like an atlas pushup)and given the instability of the webbing you also get more of a core workout. you can use the webbing for balance as well as to maintain better technique when doing squats. you can also make the exercises more challenging by using a fitness ball. you can do abdominal crunches by holding the handles and lifting your feet from the floor. some exercises (full body rows and dips) are difficult when attached to a door and lifeline suggests draping the jungle gym over a tree limb so you can achieve a truly vertical workout. i have not yet tried using this over a tree limb... however i was able to perform the dips with some creativity while attached to a door but it was not easy. this is not a full fitness solution. but when used in conjunction with weights and exercise bands it really makes the home gym complete. i have searched for a pull up bar for a long time that is removable but none of the current offerings fit the odd sized door frames and moldings of my 99 year old house. the jungle gym has worked. given the ability to do pull ups of varying difficulty it has also improved my ability to do pull ups/chin ups over a short period of time. the downside of the device is that it requires a sturdy door and door frame. i would be leery of using the device is the door does not close securely and lock or if you are worried about the integrity of your house's construction. remember the jungle gym is strong enough to hold your body weight but the door it is connected to has to be able to do the same. if not you will find yourself flat on your back with a new home improvement project to do. remember too that when your feet are touching the ground and you do pull towards the door the weight decreases as you pull. this is not a defect of the device it's just the physics of the situation. (with free weights the weight is stable throughout your range of motion. with exercise bands the weight increases as the band lengthens.) also this is a great device for weight/circuit training but is not really an aerobic solution. the jungle gym along with a few exercise bands are ideal for travel. i used mine with three lifeline exercise bands (2 r6s and 1 r8) exercise band door attachment and the lifeline triple grip handles. this yielded a gym that weighed less than two pounds fit in my suitcase easily and allowed for a variety of body weight and resistance exercises ",positive
" except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen/shorten the strap again. does exactly what it is supposed to do and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability. great for spotting oneself too. i would buy it again tho i don't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe. so if you can burn the $35 or so get it with no fear. otherwise use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout ",positive
" i bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend. no problems at all with shipping; package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps. i opened up the box and brought in pieces individually with the flywheel being the heaviest (though i was able to bring in myself). it took me about 2 hours to put together. instruction book was better than most i have seen and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes but you can figure that out easily (as everyone has noted on their reviews). the elliptical's size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room. easily moved if need be. in regards to the workout. i cross train on my treadmill and found this workout to be as effective. there are a variety of programs so you can vary your workout. the backward motion is a little awkward for me (i am 5'3) but found that holding onto the lower handlebars works well (versus the movable upper ones). the machine is very quiet only slight squeeking coming from the upper handlebars that disappeared with a little wd40. it has very smooth movement and you can definitely tell a difference with increasing the level which i was worried about as it doesn't have an incline as some gym machines do. the heel rise can occur when you do not sit back on your heels when working out so you just need to be aware of your foot placement. the foot pads are comfortable and a good size. most of all for those who do monitor their heart rate i have a polar f11 heart monitor (with chest strap) and this monitor is within a 3 beat difference at the most. i recommend to let the monitor read for a minumum of 45 seconds before you follow the rate. this held true for me even if pacing at 70 rpm's or above. i listen to my ipod when i work out so i have not used the book holder. the water holder holds 24 oz polar spring bottles without any difficulty taking out and replacing the bottle. i highly recommend this for anyone who is looking at increasing their fitness level in the comfort of their own home. it's very well built/solid quiet effective and affordable ($599 free pad free shipping) ",positive
" my husband and i finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit. : ) it only took us an hour and a half to assemble and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process. after we finished the assembly we both took a turn on a preset program. the machine is extremely sturdy quiet and worked like a charm - just like a unit found at a gym. we're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone ",positive

" just purchased this chair 3 wks ago and so far so good! i use it almost every morning for 15 minutes while i watch the news. needed a chair like this because i'm starting to get a gut and my pants are getting too tight. i hate exercizing and definitely don't have the will/motivation to go to the gym consistently. i bought the ultra version because i needed to be able to hide it away when it isn't being used. once folded up (4 1/2 inches tall - 29 inches wide - 39 inches long) it fits very nicely under my couch. it is fairly easy to fold up/unfold but it could be easier which is why i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. there are 2 bungee type straps that need to be unhooked 2 curved handle bars need to be removed (simple twist knobs) and one stabilizer bar undone (simple twist knob) to fold this unit down. removing the parts and folding the unit takes less than 2 minutes. not difficult just wish it was easier. overall i would definitely make this purchase again knowing what i now know.

" i worked with eureka to design this exclusive tent for amazon. (note: i work at amazon and am biased)...but want to share why we built this tent for amazon customers. eureka is one of the best names in the outdoors industry. their timberline tent design has been one of the most popular tents for decades. they have built on that innovation and i believe build the best family camping tents in the business. this tent was designed to offer customers an incredible value for a large family tent that has all the special features for a good-sized family: - spacious and big. it has a center height of 7 feet and feels huge. it's a 11x11 and gives you 121 square feet. you can fit 2 queen sized airbeds quite comfortably - easy assembly. shock-corded fiberglass poles and ring-and-pin systems make for an easy set-up with 2 folks. - quality. from seams that are sealed to high quality mesh. this tent is designed for rugged use through 3 seasons. as i re-read this review i realize i haven't done a sufficient job in highlighting the spacious feel of this tent. 7 foot center height is tremendous!

" it works as advertised. not a lot to say about a bike rack. i have hardly any wobble from mine and i suspect those that do didn't assemble theirs correctly or aren't tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough. my only complaint is the weight--it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack which i don't quite understand. the vertical tube has the lowest load with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube. but it's not that big a deal. it just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly ",positive
" we also bought this bike rack because of the price and it will hold 4 bikes. it could be improved on the hitch end but it was not bad. it does tend to loosen at highway speeds but we use it with the larger attachment for class 3 hitches. it kept our bikes from damaging our suburban. we use it for adult bikes and also several smaller bmx bikes. it is more challenging to get the bmxs on. one trick is to make sure you swing the arm down to mount the one inside bike then tilt it back up for the other three. also use a wrench and tighten the hitch bolt very tight with the lock washer or it will loosen on the highway. we also bought a big schwin cable lock to run through the bike frames for security while parked ",positive

" when i got the machine and started putting it together i noticed i was missing a few small pieces. understandable i think as this machine was shipped from germany. 3$ and a trip to my local hardware store later the kettler kadett was all assembled. i had some problems with the foot straps loosening while i exercised but i found that a velcro strap fastened around the toe area (to provide an additional foot strap) and some velcro adhesive slapped on the existing foot strap fixed that problem. with the exception of those minor nuisances the kettler kadett is an amazing piece of machinery. when i use it i can tell it's not going to break or fall apart at the nuts and bolts. it went together easily and it's solid as a rock when i use it. i've never rowed on a real boat in my life but this feels just as i'd imagine it would. and of course the most important part when i get off i feel like i've gotten a gym quality work out. 4 out of 5 stars for this rowing machine the packaging could have been better and slightly re-designed foot wraps but all in all an excellent buy ",positive

" many years ago an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low-rent motel. one morning while he was in the back office behind the front desk two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door. he could see them but they could not see him through the privacy security glass. the men continued to beat on the door trying to get in. he waited inside patiently with his glock pistol. as soon as the door fell and the men ran inside he shot them both. they turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money. i recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions. it turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help. when asked why he had to kill them he simply said i own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety. i did it because it was my right and i could. fortunately it was considered self-defense. i remembered that he always carried a short stick attached to his keys. it was not until many years later that i finally figured out what that little wooden stick was. i became interested in self-defense and decided to buy a baton for myself. this was my first kubaton. i was concerned because this one has a pointed end. the pointed end although not sharp compared to a blade weapon will easily punch a hole through four layers of very heavy cordura cloth with little effort on my part. i was afraid that if ever i had to use it the amount of damage it will cause and its design would make it hard for me to claim that i was acting in self-defense. i bought another kubaton from the same manufacturer with a flat end. the replacement baton is exactly like this one except the end is flat. i tested the replacement and it will also punch a hole through heavy canvas. but it takes a lot more force to do so. more importantly to the average person it looks less aggressive than this one. if i had to use it in self-defense a presiding judge or jury might be less likely to think of it as a weapon. if you are not concerned about perception then get this pointed baton. if it can easily punch a hole through layers of cordura cloth (the same material used in heavy duty outdoor bags outerwear and hiking shoes) it can easily injure an attacker who might be wearing several layers of clothes. but please understand that some might put this in the same category as they would a knife. that might make it difficult to claim self-defense in the event that you have to use it to protect yourself. my old acquaintance was well-versed and knowledgeable. he not only knew how to use his weapons but he also understood where the line is between self-defense and assault. he knew just the limits of what he could get away it in the use of deadly force to defend himself. this pointed baton made out of hardened aluminum alloy is probably for such a person. my friend's tip: here's a tip from that old acquaintance of mine. the keys themselves are a part of the weapon. and you can make them more effective which will increase the damage from the baton. take some keys that you no longer use. any metal key would do but try to find different sizes. about four of them would do. take the keys to a grinder (even a rasp will do) and sharpen the teeth of each key. now put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys. face the sharp keys in opposite directions. meaning two should face one way but the other two should face in the opposite direction. the idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker's flesh. the keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging. citan's experiment: please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand. i tried this technique. i wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post. the sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand. without the gloves my hand would have gotten badly cut. for what it's worth i swung against a large watermelon and the keys didn't bounce back though. i don't have anything else to add here except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker's fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding. i'm not an expert though. but it was fun trying it on a watermelon ",positive

" let me start by saying that i ordered this rowing machine on april 2 and it arrived on april 5! i was so excited! even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together it isn't impossible. the tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions. also two of the steps seem to be out of order but i still give this product a 5 star rating. when i was in college i used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it. this is just like it but i think it's even better. i don't have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like i did with the one at college. the quality is great for the value. i feel that i have enough resistance and that i'm getting the workout that i'm looking for. i use an elliptical rider first then i get on my rower. this is now rounding out my workout and i love it! my elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost. this rower is inexpensive but doesn't feel like a cheap machine. again i am thrilled with it. by the way i don't think that you can tell it in the picture but the fan cover has holes all the way around it. when i'm working out i can feel the breeze that it is generating. it doesn't blow me away but it's enough to cool me off some. i hope you find the machine you're looking for. if you're looking to save some money and get a great workout this may be the rower for you. ",positive
" let me start out by saying that this rower is not perfect. it is in fact flawed. as you may have noticed i still gave it a five star rating and i will try to explain the reasons for doing so. reading the reviews here i noticed two complaints: one pointing out that this machine doesn't perform to the same standards that professional gym rowers do and the other regarding assembly of this machine. i researched the various rowers available in the market for quite a while. i spent a lot of time and effort driving around and trying various models before purchasing this one simply because i tend to be an informed shopper who wants to get value for his money. during my research it became very evident that my favorite rower is a water rower followed by schwinn's windrigger - both were extremely smooth in their operation. both were also about $1000! at any rate these sophisticated rowers gave me a benchmark against which to compare the integrity and it should surprise nobody that the integrity doesn't really come close to the performance of either of the other two rowers. and it shouldn't given it substantially lower price. and this is exactly what it important in considering this rower: you cannot expect to get a professional-grade rower for such a low price just like you cannot expect to get the comfort and performance of a rolls royce if you are buying a honda. nonetheless what you do get from integrity is well within the parameters of what i would expect for about $200. the machine is reasonably stable it is reasonably smooth and it does provide a great workout. the noise level is also not too bad and actually seems less than that of the windrigger. the electric monitor is basic and provides speed time calories burned and distance. it also provides an option that continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all of them during your workout. the seat is comfortable and slides smoothly along the track and the whole thing actually has a pretty professional look to it and doesn't appear flimsy. i was also quite surprised by the level of resistance this rower provides - it is much more than that of the schwinn windrigger. in addition resistance can be adjusted pretty easily. i think my only disappointment is that the air-flow created during operation is not channeled toward the person using the machine to aid in cooling him/her down - but this is certainly a flaw i can live with. as a potential buyer you should also be aware that the rower tends to slide across smooth surfaces such as tile - which means you need to have a non-slip mat under it if you intend to use it on such a surface. as i said before i also read that at least one person had a problem assembling this rower. i cannot confirm this problem. assembly was extremely easy and quick - even though the instructions are not the greatest. however it should be quite clear to most people where parts go and what needs to be hooked up where. winding up the chain onto the gear wheel is a breeze too. all you need to do is unhook it from the retracting cord that you hooked it up to one or two steps before. i suppose the person who wrote the instructions could have switched these steps to make it more logical - but as i said the instructions are not great. taking all these factors into account i think integrity provides a fantastic product for a very low price. it does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so in a surprisingly good manner. however as with any product your expectations should be realistic and if they are you will not be disappointed. if you expect a gym-quality machine - you will not get what you are looking for. if however you are looking for a basic functional rower without all the bells and whistles of high-end products then this is probably the best deal you can get ",positive

" i wonder why the other reviewer had leaking problems - perhaps a bad silicon seal? i compared this in store to other products by thermos no-names etc and it is one of the most solidly built food carry products i've ever seen or used. i should have bought it years ago and it would have saved hundreds of dollars via home-made lunches. and jeez the worry that every time you put tupperware/ziplock lunches in your bag something is going to leak - how much is that worth to put to rest forever? i used to wrap my food-carrying plastic wear in two plastic bags in case of inevitable leakage. never again. this thing is solid. i must admit it appeals to my guy side (see my bachelor-style typical lunch and dinner below) with the hammered green siding and shiny metal parts. i think i sprouted a few extra hairs on my chest after i bought it. it looks like something you might dig out of the basement in your parents' house to which they would say oh that used to be your grandfather's and i used it too. it still works. they could call it the man-jar. (ladies don't be afraid the thermal properties are gender-blind and green will be in this fall) if you got dumped recently by your girlfriend (or wife or mom or whatever) this jar can help you in your process of manly rediscovery. despite the fact that spending money is something i generally discourage this jar will actually help you save money in the long run. you could carry it home late at night on the subway as a weapon. heck my cooking is a pretty dangerous payload. technical stuff: i put a heated hamburger patty and microwaved (prev. frozen) vegetables into the container with a thermometer. started at 180 deg. f and arrived at 140 deg. f four hours later. i bought it before a 7-day road trip living out of a cooler in the back of my car. i didn't eat a single crappy fast-food meal and i didn't spend a dollar on anything but gas.* all healthy pre-cooked home-style k-dog-style stuff. get yourself a corning wear microwave bowl with a heavy-duty fridge plastic cover and you have a home-cooked meal at every rest stop. i've put boiling water in it let it sit overnight with the top off and it was still warm in the morning. * and a hotel. and a speeding ticket. i musta been so excited to have this food bottle. damn ohio pigs ",positive

" i have been using a headlight for years when i work night shift at the hospital. when that light gave out i bought this one. i like having the three settings of brightness. though i had a light on my bike handlebars i wanted to get a light that would go on my helmet. it came down to two choices and i went with the aurora since i had been impressed with it at work. it turns out that it is brighter than the light i had on my handlebars that i paid more for just last summer. now i wish i had gotten an aurora for my handlebars also ",positive
" i was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping. it didnt take much pressure on the toes to be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal. had problems for the last 4 months before the thermoskin. have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running. great product ",positive
" the cold steel spike tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price. it is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily. it has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size i have ever seen. virtually indestructible. the case is excellent if plain. this knife leaves very wide wounds in steak; i think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds. on the down side it doesn't hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and i wear a medium glove. overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense. it is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain. it is a knife that won't let you down when the going gets tough used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient.

" this is the perfect monitor for the average person. the chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so i don't have to look at the watch while using the machines. while walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate. i haven't used the other features that are offered so i can't rate them but it does everything that i wanted out of it when i purchased it ",positive
" my treadmill came with a heart monitor of the same chest-strap type that only worked about half the time. i never had a problem like that with this one once it's on it keeps reading until i take it off. it's also compatible with all the treadmills/ellipticals/bikes at the gym so i don't have to hold the handles any more ",positive
" i am very happy with this watch. i really enjoy running and i wanted to learn how to get the best benefit from running without over-exertion and injury. the polar website said heart-rate monitoring helps with pace getting the desired benefits from my run and helped to reduce injury. pros: works perfectly immediately picked up by the gym equipment--no holding on required setting 3 zones for warm-up running and cool down was a snap the audible beeps help me to know when i'm slacking off or working too hard the constant feedback is very motivating. cons: not many here however the screen seems difficult to see in the sunshine. will have to see the effect of that when spring comes ! i did a lot of shopping online and i liked the polar m-61 ($130) best but i got this one because of the lower price ($80). the m-61 has more features and is more fashionable; so you may want to look at that one too ",positive

" i've always loved victorinox swiss army knives but i must admit that i when i purchased this one i was not sure if i made the right choice but my expectations were soon exceeded. it was right before a trip to the boundary waters canoe area wilderness in minnesota i had lost my other swiss army knife (a tinker) and i was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade. i did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness. i settled on this one because it was on sale and i have not been disappointed. the handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle. for its size it had just the right heft but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt (where i kept it in my buttoned breast pocket). the 4 locking blade worked wonderfully. i could close it with either one or two hands. when closing it the blade pauses at the halfway point reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one-handed (that said it does not eliminate all risk so close the knife with one hand at your own risk). during my recent canoe trip i lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a 24 northern pike with this blade was quite painless (though it did take some skill). beyond the blade i've always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy but the can opener blade is a primary reason why i prefer victorinox swiss army knives over those produced by wegner. the knife shipped in a simple cardboard box. a sheath or pouch would have been nice but i was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip. since i kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip the sheath wasn't necessary but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife. i recommend getting one. you will not be disappointed ",positive
" here's a secret for the uninformed: this is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish. this is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get and if you're a regular ebay seller it's one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges. with this scale and a plastic bag you can weigh any package no matter how irregularly shaped and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two. but remember- it's a secret ",positive
" these flashlights are made in china. that is not too surprising nowadays and is in no way an adverse comment on their quality and construction which seem to live up to what we might hope from a traditional american brand such as smith & wesson. i have two of these and i expect them to last me the rest of my life. (i am 60.) a tad expensive (which is why only four stars) but small enough to be convenient bright enough to be useful and efficient enough to be inexpensive to operate. i bought these flashlights for use during blackouts but their convenience has me using them for illumination whenever i am fiddling around with cables behind the tv or under the office desk or inside the computer. the small size means they are easy to hold in an armpit or in the same hand as another tool. i also bought the red-led version for use in the car so as not to affect night vision ",positive
" smith & wesson is an american arms maker. the flashlight also got solid construction and reasonable weight. the more important aspect is that it uses two aa batteries which are easy to find and economical. it came with two energizer aa batteries. three white leds are bright enough for general purposes. i keep it in my car's glove box.

" i bought one of these a while back to use as a day pack for hiking. i find it an absolutely great backpack. it has enough compartments for everything i need to carry as well as a ton of smaller pockets for nick knacks and smaller items. i found i didn't need the waist belt and never used it as it doesn't do much. (it's not like your trying to get weight to your hips with a small pack like this anyways. i ended up cutting it off. it has a nice carry handle at the top built into the harness that makes it real easy to carry this pack or move it around with one hand when not wearing it. the padding on the back is very comfortable i haven't overloaded this pack yet but with about 15-20 pounds it's very easy to wear. it has straps for a skateboard/snowboard and while i've never used it for those they make nice straps to lash things on if you wanted to. i also like the cell phone pocket which i actually do use for a cell phone. i liked that so much that i zip tied my folding knife pocket exactly opposite it. one downfall for me was the 2 side pockets. usually used for water bottles . they are quite small. my nagaline 32 oz bottles won't fit in there though no problem with smaller sizes. the pack is able to be used as a camel back though i didn't see a bladder specifically made for it. so in the end i just bought another one of these for a friends birthday and i'm really impressed with it. i would definatly recomend this pack.
