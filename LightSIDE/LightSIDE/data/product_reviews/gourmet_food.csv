" personally i didn't like tazo's red bush tea very much. i've had three different kinds of roiboos teas so far and this was my least favorite. it seems like the flavor of roiboos itself is pretty mild and in the case of tazo's tea the flavors they add completely overwhelm it. i found that i had to remove the tea bag very quickly lest the cup become overwhelmingly lemony and acidic. perhaps other pallettes will appreciate the strength of those flavors. personally i couldn't wait to finish off the box so that i could find a better flavor. the other roiboos teas i have tried have had a milder mix of flavors to a much better overall effect. my personal choice right now is trader joe's orange spice roiboos which apparently can be bought in some but not all of their stores. the orange flavor is much less up front than the lemon & citrus flavors in the tazo tea and the overall effect of the other spices is very nice. the tea smells a lot like other spiced foods (pumpkin pie comes to mind) and is very nice on a gloomy afternoon. also unlike the tazo version the flavor of this tea gets nicer and richer the longer you let the tea bag steep although even just pouring the water over the bag and leaving it for a few seconds is usually enough for a nice cup. admittedly there are a lot of other roiboos teas i have not tried but this one has been a hit with me because of its good flavor and local availability. keep in mind this is not the opinion of a tea expert and i have never had roiboos tea in africa so i don't know what it is supposed to taste like in its authentic presentation. just my personal taste ",negative

" i really do like my senseo coffee maker. i like others who have reviewed the kona pods here was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. i was excited to see that kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'. i have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one. after reading some of the reviews here i could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable. it just didn't make sense. well it still doesn't make sense but it certainly happened with the coffee i made using the kona pods also. my results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the kona pods cost a lot more than folgers or other pod brands that i can buy locally. the first thing i noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod i have ever used in my senseo. the instructions for the kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine. the kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package. i always wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the senseo. after my problems with the kona pods my husband decided that i was not 'wiggling' them enough. he promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open. so there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine. the first thing that i noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods. that did not make much sense but after several cups of kona it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods. the best i can figure out is that the kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water. there is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done. the pod itself is heavier when i take it out to throw it away. so i believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup. then as others have mentioned there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the kona pods. the problem is that for whatever reason the water does not actually go through and penetrate the kona pods during the brewing cycle. the 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water! this problem is one that i still cannot really figure out. the kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods i have tried. so i guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee. i also wonder if the paper filter of the kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate. i have tried wetting the kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod. but that has not worked for me. so it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me. i have wasted too many expensive kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. even when the kona pods brew a cup of coffee it is not as large of an amount of coffee as i get using other brands. so adding the cost of the kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work. i have been reading of a product called an ecopod. it is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers. it might be the next thing i try. ",negative
" echoing other reviews performance is not consistant. one time we did get excellent coffee this morning it jammed the senseo machine with a steam lock and there is not telling when we will be able to re-open it. considering the price of these pods even only one bad pod makes it impossible to recommend the product ",negative
" i have to agree with the guy who complained about consistency. i have wasted two very expensive pods so far. the first time i used a kona pod the machine jammed and i could not open it for 24 hours(caused a steam lock) about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo. the next time i tried a kona pod i got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. i am not very impressed so far. i am now afraid to try again.

" the product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet' as well as a bunch of other descriptors but i didn't get any sweetness at all. i was very optimistic because i normally love everything tazo offers but this time i had my hopes dashed. i brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. the teabag smelled different but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. but i scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. i managed to choke down about a third of the cup before i called it a day. life is too short to drink something you don't like. however i had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the tazo lotus. i figured it was worth a shot otherwise i'd have to throw out this tea altogether. the lotus smelled great so i was excited. i blended the two bags (one lotus and one wild sweet orange) in a large mug then removed the wild sweet orange after a minute. i left the lotus in for another minute or two (yeah definitely two). the result was a very unusual but not unappealing beverage. would i drink this more than once a day? no. was it very interesting and something that i'll try again? yes. live and learn i guess.

" i read the other reviews and was greatly excited to order this entree. i have bought 2-3 varieties of tasty bite from my local trader joes. most are decently healthy and all are easy and fast to make. peas and paneer as an entree is bland and without any heat/spice. i am a native indian so i can handle relatively spicy food. however this entree does not merit even a 2-chili rating (out of four). as for food quality i would suggest microwaving the rice and entree separately. otherwise the majority of the sauce seeps into the rice giving it a very unpleasant appearance. if you boil the pouches (an alternate option) you may have even more success. however most of us buy these because of the ease of preparation so boiling isn't a convenient option. the rice tastes and looks as it should. finally i do recommend tasty bite entre jaipur vegetables. i am on box nine of twelve and still not tired. this entree is much spicier - closer to a 3.25 chili rating (out of four). i also favor this entree because it doesn't have the throw-away plastic container in each box. moreover you get 12-boxes for a better price than the 6-boxes for the peas and paneer. i look forward to trying the other tasty bites though i will likely sample the flavors at trader joe's before ordering another 6- or 12-box set. no more tasty bite purchases from the gold box unless i have already tried that particular flavor - lesson learned ",negative

" i liked these. i was prepared for an awful stench upon opening the package but mine didn't smell at all. i followed the instructions and was pleasantly suprised by the taste and unique (unique = good) texture. these noodles weren't like pasta but they were good. i'll have no problem eating them agian. as a matter of fact i thought they were quite delicious ",positive
" i bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the hungry girl website and i am glad that i did. they work well in a number of different recipes are filling and add a calcium boost to the dishes i use them in for very few calories. these are not pasta type noodles of course - the texture is different (softer and kind of slippery) and they have virtually no flavor of their own - they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them. i probably won't use these noodles with european-style or american-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas which these are not. on the other hand these noodles are fine in such asian recipes as pad thai lo mein and dan-dan noodes (basically noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce). there are a lot of asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the internet which are fairly easy to make taste terrific and work beautifully with these noodles. you can prepare yourself a real treat if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture and for a fraction of the calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice. in short if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles you're likely to be disappointed but if you use them in pad thai any type of curry other asian dishes or most soups you're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal low-carb meal. one thing - when you open the bag there is a slight ammonia-like odor (it smells ammonia-like to me anyway). if you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes as per the package directions the odor really does disappear. it is not a strong odor it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like that but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them. just follow the package directions ",positive
" it ain't spaghetti folks but used properly it can enhance your eating. it's great in a wet soupy type dish. eaten as is (after rinsing) the noodles are very soft and tender too soft to pass for a dry italian type pasta unless you always cook dry pasta to death. boiling them for a minute or two firms them up somewhat but they never become as firm as a properly cooked dried pasta. for the reviewer who said that pasta is out due to his/her type 2 diabetes... it's not! i'm in the same boat and we can still enjoy pasta we just need to measure it to control the carb servings and always use whole grain types to slow down the sugar load. i weigh out 2 oz. before cooking for 2 carb exchanges (the 1/2 cup serving measurement is absurd because different types of pasta will fill a cup differently) and i use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables and have a big salad on the side.the oil and vinegar salad dressing helps to further temper the blood sugar rush. of course if you eat lots of carbs for breakfast and lunch don't plan on 2 carb servings of pasta for dinner. and i have given up the (white) italian bread on the side! that's the worst part but the pasta is at least do-able. ",positive
" if you've missed your favorite pastas because of your low-carb diet this definitely is the product for you. though it doesn't have the starchy quality of pasta it's a convincing substitute if you're don't mind sacrificing texture for a low-calorie low-carb meal. be sure to drain adequately before you top with a sauce otherwise you end up with a slimy mess. otherwise i would recommend this product to anyone who misses pastas because of atkins south beach etc. ",positive
" if you're expecting egg pasta made from the finest durum wheat you'll be disappointed but if you're a fan of japanese sukiyaki stir-fry udon and chow fun these low carb subs will be right up your alley. also and excellent sub for pad thai dishes. if the texture doesn't bother you then go ahead and try it with your favorite western-style dishes. shirataki (shredded konjac) really has no flavor itself but like tofu it absorbs flavors extremely well. in addition to being low in calories and carbs it's very good for your digestive system! eat up ",positive
" i read about this product on the hungry girl website. it listed amazon as a supplier. i read all the reviews and decided to place an order. it took longer than i expected to arrive since i had to pay extra shipping i thought it would be here sooner. the extra shipping must have been for the cool pack in the box it was shipped in. the noodles were a little chewier than regular pasta. but like regular pasta the didn't really have a taste of their own and took on the taste of what ever sauce you use. i really did like them. being diabetic it is a great pasta alternative that will not raise my blood sugar. and i didn't find a unpleasant smell when i opened the bag as another reviewer wrote. just the same i did rinse them well. i have since found them in a local health food store so i won't have to pay the high shipping any more. i have not been able to find the spaghetti type anywhere only the flat noodle type and i would really like to try the spaghetti. i would recommend this product to any one that wants a lower carb lower calorie pasta ",positive

" these noodles are traditional for sukiyaki but work well as oriental noodles or even chicken soup noodles. and made of tofu they won't add carbs to your diet. i find i cannot eat processed starch--upsets my stomach so these are a total lifesaver. and the slightly slippery soft texture is soothing. love'em ",positive
" i was actually anxiously waiting to try these since the reviews were mixed but i am soooooo glad i did try them bec now i am hooked!!!! yes they are a bit expensive when compared to pasta but i think of it as paying some extra bucks to remove some pounds off! i make sure i rinse them really well in cold water right before i boil them for around 5 minutes which removes all the bad smell! i just add some marinara sauce and it is a done deal! i found the texture to be actually good like a firmer version of the ramen noodles! i think these make an excellent snack or meal! ",positive
" i stumbled on these in whole foods and decided to buy a couple of packages. i have never been disappointed with anything i have eaten them with. maybe it's because i am a heck of a cook! :-) this are not pasta they are tofu. if you are looking for something to be negative and skeptical about you will find it. i could eat these noodles with home made spaghetti sauce every single day! go ahead try them for yourself...if you have an open mind you will not be disappointed! also the shipping should not be a bad reflection on the quality/taste of the product it's self. this stuff is great...look for them in a store near you so you won't have to worry about the shipping...

" my husband is a big fan of this instant tea and always claims that it got rid of his cold/sickness right away. i have always thought that he exaggerated it until i was so cold and feeling really sick after a 2 hr working outdoor in the cold. the first thing i did after i came home was making a cup of hot ginger instant tea (which take me about 5 sec) and drank it right way. i have to admit it is like a miracle! my nose almost stopped running right away. my headache was also so much better. i could feel the warmth running down and really warmed up my whole body. the tea is very pleasant not too spicy and not too sweet either. it is extremely tasty. i highly recommend this tea to anyone who need to go out a lot or use it to guard you from winter sickness ",positive

" i bought this over 6 months ago from an asian food store. it is so good! it's really cool how the rice paper melts in your mouth. i gave some to my little cousins and they loved it. it's a wonderful thing to suck on and it's not very sticky either. it also comes with a sticker or a tatoo. ",positive
" this candy is the best and once you have it.. you will always long for it! the candy is wonderful and the rice paper that melts in your mouth is a novelty and delicious. there is a temporary tattoo with these candies. thank you amazon.com for making it easier to find ",positive

" i buy these ginger chews for when i feel sick to my stomach. they really help ",positive
" this has a wonderfully intense ginger flavor without managing to be overwhelming. i cannot speak about its effectiveness in combatting motion sickness though it did do a good job settling an upset stomach. that being said whatever ends up getting you interested in this product whether it be the flavor or the other properties of ginger this is definitely a candy you will want in your candy dish desk etc. my only suggestion is to buy more than one at a time because the flavor is so good that you will go through these rather quickly ",positive
" i love this product. it is not super sweet like american sweets but just right. it tastes like drinking green tea iced tea. very refreshing with only one. these japanese foods are high on flavor and it makes it so easy to eat just a few. i am dieting so i like something i am not prone to over eat. they do have hydrogenated oils so that is not good but i hear there is something about possibly getting it out. another interesting ingredient was shea great for lotion and a nut butter that tastes good too i know now. very good refreshing after meal taste. one is even satisfiying and i mean one stick. not one individual pack. they come in small packs so they are easy to take on the go. enjoy ",positive
" yummy green tea pocky!!!!! just make sure you purchase this in the fall/winter months otherwise it'll melt in the mail. i would've given this 5 stars had the pocky not melted together into a lump ",positive
" i love green tea pocky. it's flavour is indescribable! it's sweet yet light. you can only eat a few though before it's enough for ya. i'd suggest that everyone try these they're that good. :d also the strawberry pocky with little chunks on them are awesome too. ^_^ try them ",positive
" pocky are good if your a new to the japanese sugar covered biscut style of food. i perfer yan yan i believe they have more substance. but are more messy if you dont have biscut dipping skills. ",positive
" i like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea. it has a great taste and is not super sweet. i find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate. unlike the other person i am not addicted but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies. if you like green tea i think you will like these. i drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it. nice refreshing candy. individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time ",positive
" i don't even like tea but these candies are delicious. on first taste they're a little bitter and weird tasting as you absorb the green tea powder coating. as you continue eating the candy it develops into a chewy tasty gummy type candy. very tasty and definitely grows on you! one warning they're not a healthy snack so watch out how many the you and the kids eat ",positive
" this is my first asian food purchase with pier mall and my first review here at amazon as well... these matcha candies get better and better with each one- i can see how they could become quite addictive! individually wrapped and matcha powder coated this flavor takes some getting used... the outside is kind of hard underneath the powder and then the inside is all chewy and decadent- yummy - actually i think i'm already addicted!! also nice to travel with or put in your bag- these won't melt or make a mess.

" obviously the cheese is sent in a cooler box to keep it fresh and ready to be consumed by the customer dillon you idiot! who the hell gives a piece of cheese as a gift what a dope! i would rather have packaging that protects and saves my investment rather than looks pretty and dillon the moron talks about french cheese my last name is ouellette you cant get more french than that dumbass ",positive
" the taste is really great it is a bitter chocolate and tastes like one that is expensive high end to me. mens is the name perhaps because the 2 individual packs are so big. when i first saw that i wondered if this was a musk candy like they have in australia. nope these are for everyone. it is an easy way to have an easy dose of chocolate. i cannot eat a whole pack just one stick at a time. share this with some friends. would be fun to have these for a party ",positive
" when most of reviewers praise other pocky this is really so much better: it is more slender with richer chocolate. it actually has more sticks than almost all other pocky types. the chocolate is slightly bitter than the red chocolate pocky but no too much. very balanced. if you love chocolate this is definitly better... worth trying ",positive
" as it say so astutely on box of glowing color this yum-yum pocky is for men only. it not good or happy for womens to consume. do not dare to ask why for that journey will not be pleasant. only accept and then you will see the joys of pocky. this pocky for men. get other pocky for womens. then two can be most happiness in joy of whirlwinds ",positive

" my japanese pen pal y. yamamoto just adores strawberry pocky and tells me they're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations. mind you i'm not sure i should believe yohko-chan as she describes these situations many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way but i must admit they're entertaining reading. and the souvenier she sent me from that space hot springs was rather interesting -- although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me. still i want to date her friend ruuan. she looks hot in an amazingly ditzy sort of way.... ",positive
" first of all i do agree with the above reviewers who thought this wasn't a great fruit dip. second there's very little marshmallow flavor-this stuff is nothing like regular marshmallow fluff. however i still give this 5 stars because it's got features you can't get anywhere else. the texture is smooth pudding (grainy reviewer perhaps ate his past the expiration date?) and that's mainly how i use this. because of the slightly sharp taste of the cellulose this dip lends itself very well to making citrus puddings (just add about 1/4 cup lemon concentrate and stir doesn't get any easier than that). i also use it to make cheesecake and other dessert recipes. to actually make a good fruit dip out of this try mixing it with yogurt or cream cheese ",positive
" i don't know what everyone else is talking about! this dip is delicious! i like to put a scoop ontop of some sliced up strawberrys and yummy! the chocolate is only okay but this marshmellow tastes just like the real dip...its not supposed to tasts like marshmellow fluff or anything! highly reccomended from a girl with a sweet tooth ",positive

" can't go wrong here. intense flavor and impressive ingredients. i love 'em and everyone i give them to loves them. get a load of these ingredients: organic evaporated cane juice organic tapioca syrup (no sulfites added) non-gmo citric acid (from non-gmo sugar beet) organic & natural flavors* (watermelon pomegranate orange oils lemon oils raspberry) organic & natural colors (red cabbage purple carrots). * = cheeky lemon wet-face watermelon pomegranate pucker orange squeeze & upcoming mango tango flavor contain some amount of orange or lemon or citrus oils (0.58% of the natural flavor formula of watermelon is derived from lemon oil). safflower oil is in the wet-face watermelon and upcoming mango tango. holy cow!!! and they're really really good!

" this is the candy our two boys ask for the most. and their friends (and their parents) love them too. we gave them out for halloween and had rave reviews back from neighbors. it's great to be able to give out candy to trick or treaters and to guests that we know won't hurt anyone (no peanuts no corn no artificial anything). just great taste! rock on yummy earth.

" i am a mom of four who tries to balance a limited grocery budget with the healthiest food that my family can eat. i keep making more and more changes as i gather more information and products like this become so readily available. anyway i have been concerned about food dyes lately but still wanted my kids to be able to have some kind of a candy treat. i thought i would give these a try. i just got them yesterday. i haven't given any to the kids yet (i am saving them for christmas) but i also didn't want to wait until then and find out from the kids that they were horrible. so i performed my own taste test of three of the flavors and i found them to be delicious. i know the kids will love them!

" these lollipops are intense & delicious. my kids love them and so do my co-workers ",positive
" dealing with an allery to corn isn't easy but these lollipops sure make it seem a lot easier. they're wonderfully flavored organic and made by a company who honestly cares about its customers. these are a great find and a staple of my house. they're just awesome its hard to believe they're corn-free ",positive
" my friend told me how she loves these yummyearth lollipops so i bought a bag to share at work. everyone loves them like crazy and we're almost done with them in just a few days. really packed with great flavor. different than other candy. very fruity and real tasting not like overly sugary fake flavor of regular candy. just awesome taste. pretty cool too that it's organic ",positive
" this is a very good product. it keeps you from having to try to mix your own cinnamon and sweetener. it's good for a lot of things for those who can't have sugar. my favorite is cinnamon toast. i will reorder it when i am out of it. it's so nice to have something with splenda instead of aspartame ",positive
" this product is great! i love cinnamon sugar on my toast and bagels but not all the calories. i didn't want to just mix splenda and cinnamon together on my own since i didn't know what ratio to use. i will definitely order this again when the 3 i bought are almost gone ",positive
" i bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the hungry girl website and i am glad that i did. they work well in a number of different recipes are filling and add a calcium boost to the dishes i use them in for very few calories. these are not pasta type noodles of course - the texture is different (softer and kind of slippery) and they have virtually no flavor of their own - they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them. i probably won't use these noodles with european-style or american-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas which these are not. on the other hand these noodles are fine in such asian recipes as pad thai lo mein and dan-dan noodes (basically noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce). there are a lot of asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the internet which are fairly easy to make taste terrific and work beautifully with these noodles. you can prepare yourself a real treat if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture and for a fraction of the calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice. in short if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles you're likely to be disappointed but if you use them in pad thai any type of curry other asian dishes or most soups you're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal low-carb meal. one thing - when you open the bag there is a slight ammonia-like odor (it smells ammonia-like to me anyway). if you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes as per the package directions the odor really does disappear. it is not a strong odor it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like that but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them. just follow the package directions ",positive
" it ain't spaghetti folks but used properly it can enhance your eating. it's great in a wet soupy type dish. eaten as is (after rinsing) the noodles are very soft and tender too soft to pass for a dry italian type pasta unless you always cook dry pasta to death. boiling them for a minute or two firms them up somewhat but they never become as firm as a properly cooked dried pasta. for the reviewer who said that pasta is out due to his/her type 2 diabetes... it's not! i'm in the same boat and we can still enjoy pasta we just need to measure it to control the carb servings and always use whole grain types to slow down the sugar load. i weigh out 2 oz. before cooking for 2 carb exchanges (the 1/2 cup serving measurement is absurd because different types of pasta will fill a cup differently) and i use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables and have a big salad on the side.the oil and vinegar salad dressing helps to further temper the blood sugar rush. of course if you eat lots of carbs for breakfast and lunch don't plan on 2 carb servings of pasta for dinner. and i have given up the (white) italian bread on the side! that's the worst part but the pasta is at least do-able. ",positive
" having begged a local super market wegmans in buffalo ny suburbsi found this product in the refrigerated isle w/yogurt and procesed and packaged ready to eat heat and serve items. texture was not exactley what i expectedbut knowing that being a type ii diabetic put regular spagetti out of reach (too high in carbs.)i ate the treat with my favorite saucethen proceeded to put on my shoes and drive directley to the supermarket to purchase another pound of shirataki spagetti for my next planned sauce meal. this product is great for me because i eat alone several times a week it is easy to prepare and is satisfying . i do have a problem with the high cost $1.99 per poundbut i will use this product again just not as often as i would like. ",positive
" if you've missed your favorite pastas because of your low-carb diet this definitely is the product for you. though it doesn't have the starchy quality of pasta it's a convincing substitute if you're don't mind sacrificing texture for a low-calorie low-carb meal. be sure to drain adequately before you top with a sauce otherwise you end up with a slimy mess. otherwise i would recommend this product to anyone who misses pastas because of atkins south beach etc. ",positive

" yes! yes! yes! this marshmallow cream is amazing. i'm diabetic with an enormous sweet tooth and this stuff is a g-dsend. sooo yummy and sweet without that weird cloying aftertaste or mouthfeel. just marshmallow goodness. i'm sure as other reviewers have suggested it has many uses. maybe i'll discover some of them with my next batch; the first batch got eaten plain -- it was *that* good. (i am thinking of bringing it camping so that when the rest of the family has their s'mores around the campfire i can make a little tin foil packet of my own with this chocolate and graham crackers and rest it in the coals. how good would that be?!

" wow! what else can i say. this is some amazing tasting marshmallow. i made fluffer nutter sandwiches for the first time in almost 10 years! i never thought i would be able to do that again! i don't know what amazed me more the incredible taste and marshmallow made without sugar and other artificial flavors or the fact that when i called to find out if i could buy it local i was informed that it was only available direct from this company and that they would be making fresh marshmallow the next day if i wanted to order more.....you mean it doesnt spend 6 months in a warehouse and a couple of months on a supermarket shelf? wow! this really is the best thing since sliced bread at least in my book it is. i was also told it works well to make rice crispy treats i'll try that with my next tub! i'm so excited about finding this little treat ",positive

" **** tazo assorted black and green teas and herbal infusions includes one or two of each: awake: plain ordinary black tea a little bitter calm: nice chamomile tea chai black tea: an okay chai black tea with caffeine china green tips: great green tea experience tazo's best no natural flavorings decaffeinated chai: an okay chai black tea without caffeine earl grey black tea: a disappointing perfumy intense black tea experience lotus: decaf green tea with lotus flower one of my favorite tazo's passion herbal infusion: hibiscus-y intense caffeine-free and luxurious wild sweet orange: orange herbal tea some complex overtones perhaps zen: mild relaxed green tea their ingredients include: black tea green tea hibiscus flowers chamomile flowers lemongrass citric acid natural flavors spearmint leaves blackberry leaves cinnamon rooibos ginger root rose hips orange peel rose petals licorice root safflower black pepper lemon verbena leaves cardamom cloves peppermint leaves chicory sarsaparilla root lemon balm leaf star anise and red poppy flowers. tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. in general i'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing. overall the green teas seem good. the herbal infusions are fine. the black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. tazo's assortment and tazo teas in general are fine---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as numi or aspen or other super premium teas made with only real ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. i'm more used to these high quality teas which tazo attempts to be but disappoints...so overall tazo assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. for this review i'm rounding up since so many people seem to enjoy these teas and i'm in the clear minority. if your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality no doubt tazo's teas will appeal to you as they are a great improvement. they have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. if you don't enjoy tazo's teas though know that there are many many teas made with all real ingredients teas that cost only a fraction more that may be just the thing you were looking for. *** ",positive
" this is one of the nicest tea assortments to keep on hand for yourself or visitors. awake is a great quality sweet black assam tea. by sweet i mean it is not too astringent or bitter. calm is a chamomile-lavender blend very distinctive there is a green tea a mint and other flavors that will please nearly anyone. you can try these teas to see what are your favorites (the fine earl grey?) and this is also great to keep in your office or home for treating guests to whatever tea they may prefer ",positive
" my first tazo experience included a box of interesting items from a friend and packets of tazo green ginger tea which was slightly bitter and delicious with orange blossom honey. this box of assorted teas: awake - keeps you very very awake! calm - chamomile china green tips earl grey - perfumed tazo chai - spicy passion - hibiscus flowers and orange for a calming blend decaffeinated tazo chai wild sweet orange - really delicious when blended with lotus and poured over ice lotus zen - nice alternative to black tea and has a lemon verbena spearmint and lemongrass twist. the ingredients include: black tea green tea hibiscus flowers chamomile flowers lemongrass spearmint leaves blackberry leaves cinnamon rooibos gingerroot rose hips orange peel rose petals licorice root safflowers black pepper lemon verbena leaves cardamom cloves peppermint leaves chicory sarsaparilla root lemon balm leaf star anise and red poppy flowers. i use 16 ounces of water and two tea bags for each experience. when you drink these teas you can transcend reality for moments at a time and that is all the truth i need about these teas. some of these teas even evoke a sense of wonder. warning: highly addictive teas. once you taste these teas you will want to try them all and forever be on a search for new tazo teas. fortunately they have enough tea blends to entertain you for years. ~therebeccareview.com ",positive

" this is my favorite tea. it's strong and spicy and to me tastes like cinnamon and orange. i prefer it hot but like it cold especially in the summer. i think it's the best thing on winter mornings ",positive
" my first experiance with marketspice tea was on a cold day in alaska. it's warming tastes great and is just what's needed on a cold day. i discribe the tea as orange flavored with a bite it's aroma fills a room creating a warm feeling ",positive
" my husband and i were introduced to market spice tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in seattle. we loved it and upon our return to jamesville ny begain to regularly order it. many of our friends now order it too. it is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer. 23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea ",positive
" market spice tea is the name of the signature blend and the tea company that has been producing it since the early 1900's in pike place market in seattle. it is black tea flavored with cinnamon orange peel and essential oils. it is naturally sweet but contains no sugar or sweetener. many people who don't like tea love it. it is very fragrant and is great hot or iced. if you are used to drinking black tea with no flavor or sweetener you may prefer to blend it with a plain black tea as it is a very strongly flavored tea. taste it before sweetening it. you should buy it in small quantities because it contains no preservatives and the citrus oils can go off after six months or so. you should also make sure not to store it or serve it in plastic or styrofoam as the citrus oils react with them. ",positive
" tea of course is a matter of taste and this one fits my taste to a tee (p.i.). i'm generally not a tea drinker but was first given this product as a gift. that was five years ago and i'm hooked. we even moved to europe and i get it sent over here ",positive
" i lived in seattle for almost 20 years. however in all that time and even going down to the pike place market at least 2 or 3 times a year (we lived far east of town) i never knowingly drank marketspice tea. however we moved to north carolina and discovered this wonderful drink. we also became avid tea drinkers. a good part of that conversion was due to marketspice tea. the flavors are spicey pungent smack you up side the head intense. if you like lipton you won't like this. we use the loose tea only. yes it's a little more of a hassle compared to tea bags but worth it due to the freshness flavor etc. also until the our last purchase which was from amazon we always ordered from marketspice themselves. they're great people they always shipped what i wanted etc. i'll never buy from them directly again. they don't want to move into the 21st century when it concerns automation and i respect that. however i have. amazon gives me the capability to do both; order my favorite tea and do so online with a company that remembers my address credit card etc. i can wholeheartdly recommend this product and ordering through amazon. if you like tea you owe it to yourself to try this product. ",positive
" my sister (who reviewed the mst bags) turned me on to this tea in january. i was a chai girl up to that point a cup in the morning. i could generally take it or leave it. now no day is complete without my beloved mst. i began with bags which are amazing. i upped it to loose tea pound bags and have become a total tea person. i do believe i will branch out this time and order some rooibos and green versions--may as well make the shipping charge worth the time. i can't say enough about this sweet spicy stuff. it needs nothing but one enormous cup because a little one just won't do. prepare to become addicted. oh and i've lost a lot of weight too because i no longer drink coffee with creamers and truly have no sweet cravings anymore. if that doesn't justify buying it by the pound nothing will! enjoy this amazing brew! and share it with a friend ",positive
" of all teas i've tried this is my favorite; sweet powerful and fragrant marketspice is the answer for many moods and cravings. i prefer this tea hot steeped for 5+ minutes but its good cold as well-although i've found adding any sweeteners to this tea can make it too overwhelming. be warned: if you only like very subtle white teas this may not be for you . . . but it has converted many a non-tea-drinker friend of mine into looseleaf addicts ",positive
" i was always hunting for popcorn salt in markets and only occasionally finding it....this is just what i wanted and in a large enough size to be economical and last for a whil ",positive
" i've been trying to buy this off the shelf and just could not find it (for like 2 years). i mainly wanted it for texture -- table salt is not fine enough. this stuff is so fine it completely changes the flavors. i wouldn't have believed it myself ",positive
" this is a great product. it's texture makes it perfect for other things besides popcorn. with salt in so many products i don't worry about the lack of iodine in this salt. after all it's not like you eat it everyday. in fact it sticks so well you can actually use less. good product ",positive
" i love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn. it is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other gourmet salts but it is only 15 cents per ounce not 15 dollars. note that this salt is flaked unlike the normal crystals for which diamond salt is known. it absolutely clings to the surface of the popcorn fries and other similarly-textured foods much better. it has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and clean is always good in my book. as a treat i sometimes iick the tip of my index finger sprinkle a little of this on it and then pretend like i'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter but without the lime. almost like a couple of hours on the beach. i can only give it four stars instead of five because it is not iodized and you could end up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine. this is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood but if you live in the midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties ",positive
" try something different. forget microwave popcorn for a few weeks and try this four-pack just once. at the very least you'll have a new food experience but what you might get is a new family tradition. it's worth it. my wife and i received a four-pack of fireworks popcorn last year with these four flavors and because we are huge fans of stovetop-popping popcorn it was a definite treat. we love watching movies and it's a weekend tradition to make a giant tub of popcorn and jump on the couch. this 4-pack is a fantastic way to discover the differences in types of popcorn and there really are subtle differences. there is a description of the flavor on each bottle and the bottles also tell you about the size and robustness of the finished product. as gourmet as any other gourmet popcorn i've ever tried the kernels pop up nice and big and almost every kernel pops. the flavors augment a good low-fat butter spray if that's your fancy. i'm very much looking forward to receiving the 8-flavor sampler! personally i pop mine in olive oil with a few dashes of garlic-infused oil and/or the red spicy olive oil and a little salt. that is something you can't do in a microwave! if you've never popped popcorn on a stove before and you're intimidated... no worries. pour in enough popcorn to cover the bottom of the pot add enough olive oil cover up about half the height of the kernels shake it over the heat until the popping almost stops and pour out the popcorn into a bowl asap. practice makes perfect and you don't need much practice at all... maybe just one try! honestly for the labor of about 90 seconds on the stove and one pot to wash you turn an evening of tv-viewing or movie watching into an event. the kids will love it and as a grown-up kid i highly recommend it. i have fond memories of my dad making popcorn for the three kids on saturday nights and this is a good product to make those memories ",positive

" like an apricot but better in my opinion. the downy fuzz the sweet juicy flesh there really is nothing like a good peach. i think they are best on their own though some like to cut them up in a fruit salad or make a peach melba. that is fine but i would strongly advise against cooking them. in my opinion this is a waste of a good peach. a friend of mine swears by his baked peaches with demerera sugar and cinnamon but he is a savage and a charlatan. to conclude peaches are without doubt one of the finest fruits around. there are few things as satisfying as a sweet ripe peach on a sunny day.

" earl grey is supposedly the second most popular tea in the world. traditionally earl grey is created from a blend of black teas usually chinese and indian teas sometimes with a smokey flavor and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. earl grey tea has an interesting history. legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to lord grey from a chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of lord grey's men. twinings and jacksons of piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea. tazo shows considerable expertise in the blend of this top quality tea. the black teas utilized are as the box states the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of nuwara eliya uva and dimbula in sri lanka and assam in northeast india. they provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend. the fragrance is powerfully floral in particular lavender citrus and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. the flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. a tasty sensual delight! earl grey is traditionally served black sometimes with lemon. i prefer it with cream. on a warning note if you keep this tea in the cupboard for too long it will get old--the taste becomes very thin and harsh. brew it from fresh teabags and you won't be disappointed ",positive
" i'm a great fan of earl grey tea and have enjoyed starting my morning with a cup o' the grand stuff for nearly fifteen years. as it happens i am in very good company in this practice along with the likes of captain picard and the eponymous earl charles grey himself. earl grey is one of the more popular and well-known kinds of tea in the world and deservedly so. despite general belief earl grey is not a tea varietal at all but simply ordinary black tea infused with bergamot a citrus flavor from the rind of the fruit. try your cup with a few drops of fresh lemon juice for some occasional yet delicious variety. it is also pretty neat to watch the lemon juice lighten the tea from dark brown to yellow as the citric acid reacts with the blend! the tazo version of earl grey is one of the best i have ever tasted. perfectly balanced light aromatic.....it's the perfect start to a morning ",positive
" these truffles are very very sweet and very very rich. the powdered sugar forms a thin crisp shell around a thick layer of creamy white chocolate which is filled by a dark chocolate/champagne ganache. i don't hesitate to offer them to friends because nobody eats more than one or two at a time. they're just that rich. i recommend them for a totally luxurious experience especially if you are giving small gift boxes w/ only a few chocolates. i don't recommend for people who prefer their chocolate less sweet. actually they are a bit too sweet for me but i gave five stars because the product description warned me and they're still really good. people who have a bigger sweet tooth than mine probably won't share. the packaging is a gold box wrapped in blue and white leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box. for shipping the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell. mine arrived within three days and looked like i'd purchased it at the store to give as a gift ",positive

" the sugar was perfect i ordered it to go on a cookie i make only at christmas time. the cookie is an almond flavored one that you make by chiliing the dough and then cutting off a small piece which you make into a ball and then roll by hand out so it is about 9 inches long. you try to keept it a little thicker in the very middle so when you twist it it has a tapered look. you leave the top with a small opening so you can put a pretty ribbon thru it like it can be hung on the tree. when they are cooked and still warm you put a thin coating on them of powdered sugar and almond flavoring and water and when they are still sticky you sprinkle the sugar on. they came out beautiful i then put them in an old cookie tin and serve them up to company they think i am soooooo talented and it is so easy ",positive

" true they are a bit bitter but not too bitter and not nearly as bitter as unsweetened baker's chocolate! there are also some taste components i noticed that i've never noticed with processed chocolate a delicate floral essence and flavor that adds character. i was also surprised to find that raw cacao smells and looks like cooked chocolate i thought the smell and brown colour came mostly from the cooking process. i want to try grinding them up and sweetening with agave nectar a delicious sweetener with a low glycemic index. i tried sweetening a ground up mix with stevia i think i might've used too much and i don't recommend this! stevia is a good sweetener for a lot of foods but using too much leaves a bitter aftertaste. i'd recommend this product to anybody who likes chocolate especially raw foodists and chocolate connoisseurs. enjoy ",positive
" i'm very happy to have discovered these & will definitely continue to use them in baking it helps me cut back on the semi-sweet choc morsels with a healthier alternative. as far as eating them raw - i don't recommend it at all!!! very bitter taste raw. maybe some would enjoy it but i would venture a guess that it's a minority of people rather than a majority ",positive
" rings-ding's are the best snacks out there for many a reasons. first off they are the best after dinner snacks out there. it's really like a cake just more condensed and not as fatty or filling. also these things are addicting. in my life i cannot even count how much packs i have consumed since i have been eating these things everyday since i was young and let's just say now i am very old. if you cannot afford drugs then go for the ring-ding's. the only negative about these things if there isn't enough cream then you get a mouthful of chocolate. most people i know like the chocolate but i personally would not like a mouthful of it. another bad thing is in the summer they are melted and can only be slightly revived if refrigerated. they kind of lose that good flavor edge in the summer which makes this the perfect snack for the winter. alright...the anatomy of a ring-ding (dun-dun-dun). first off you get a chocolatey outside that is pretty soft. in the center is a creamy sensation (sorry if that sounded dirty...get your mind out of the gutter) that really makes this product go from good to great. put that together and you get probably the best snack out there right now. they come two in a pack and are made by drake's. usually drake's is in the shadow of hostess yet i feel drake's destroys hostess in terms of their cakes. if you are actually reading this please don't destroy me for saying that ring-ding's totally annihilates anything hostess has ever put out. wow...i managed to make a food product two paragraphs long (two short paragraphs i should say). i would put the whole history of the ring-ding in but that would probably be taking someone else's work. i guess i'll stop now. anyway ring-ding's for the win!!

" in many languages around the world chai simply means tea. in india however the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the west is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea. chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea rich milk various spices and a sweetner. the spices most commonly used are cardamom cinnamon ginger cloves and pepper; tazo's very peppery chai adds rooibos vanilla star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe. you should always have this tea with real sugar even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. and if you like your store-bought chai maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices too! namaste ..

" **** tazo's chai black tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. on the paper tea packet tazo writes a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the himalayas. on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of chai as cinnamon creamy sweet spice and medium-bodied yet full-flavored with the spicy kick of cinnamon ginger cardamom and black pepper. tazo describes the aroma as sweet spice. those are pretty accurate. the black tea blend is a little bitter though even with minimal brewing. it's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter. the ingredients in chai are: black teas ginger cinnamon black pepper cardamom cloves and star anise. it is caffeinated. tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not as good as numi. i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo chai gets only four stars. *** ",positive

" i have been using a chemex 10-cup coffee maker for almost a year and have never had such good coffee before in my life. i am constantly looking forward to my next pot of coffee! there is a downside to this coffee maker: it is a more manual procedure than what you are used to and it also takes a couple of pots to learn how to use this most efficiently. the first time i tried to use mine i had ground my coffee way too finely and it just took forever! the big time consumers: you have to boil your water separately (you do have a water kettle right?) and then you have to gradually pour the boiled water through the chemex. this means that while the coffee is brewing you are pouring or watching or giving the filter area a bit of a stir. now the up side: you will never ever ever drink a better cup of coffee. i use filtered water freshly ground home roasted beans and this chemex to produce the finest coffee i have ever had the pleasure of drinking. and this coffee is a pleasure! in fact i've totally given up using cream and sugar because my coffee no longer has anything to hide. another up side: clean up means swishing the chemex with warm water and tossing the water down the drain. you can also wash with a bottle brush but this is rarely necessary. a brief swish is really all it takes to get your chemex looking factory new. try that with your electric drip machine! ha! that thing will never look brand new! oh here's a final upside: this chemex brews the best coffee you'll ever drink and it costs less than just about anything. you are probably already spending more money than this every month at starbucks! go ahead and buy yourself one of these. if necessary wake up 10 minutes earlier to make your coffee. better yet wake up 20 minutes earlier. and when your coffee is ready instead of dumping it into a travel cup and bolting out the door sit down and enjoy your first cup for the next 10 minutes. you deserve it ",positive

" earl grey is supposedly the second most popular tea in the world. traditionally earl grey is created from a blend of black teas usually chinese and indian teas sometimes with a smokey flavor and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. earl grey tea has an interesting history. legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to lord grey from a chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of lord grey's men. twinings and jacksons of piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea. tazo shows considerable expertise in the blend of this top quality tea. the black teas utilized are as the box states the worlds most sought after teas from the high-elevation gardens of nuwara eliya uva and dimbula in sri lanka and assam in northeast india. they provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend. the fragrance is powerfully floral in particular lavender citrus and the woodsy-malt scent of premium black tea. the flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed. a tasty sensual delight! earl grey is traditionally served black sometimes with lemon. i prefer it with cream. on a warning note if you keep this tea in the cupboard for too long it will get old--the taste becomes very thin and harsh. brew it from fresh teabags and you won't be disappointed ",positive

" this is like hot sauce concentrate. you must dilute it to use it. do not try to eat this stuff straight or you will be miserable for hours and then some. lets just say it burns both ways. a teaspoon in an entire crock of chili will make the chili hot enough to be near inedible and i like very hot and spicy foods. five or six drops is probably more than enough for an entire dish. tabasco isn't even comparable to this because no amount of tabasco would make a dish that hot. this is truly the hotest sauce i have ever had i think it killed my tastebuds (slight sarcasm). wash your hands thoroughly after use as there will often be residue on the lid. if you rub your eyes they will burn for a long time and i would suggest flushing them with water for about 10 minutes if you have the unfortunate experience. the first listed ingredient is habaneros ",positive
" hottest sauce in the universe: no brag just fact. i find that a single drop of dave's ultimate insanity is more than equivalent to ten drops of tabasco. why not five stars? while this sauce gives new meaning to the term extreme heat i find the taste of tabasco more pleasant. ultimate insanity adds a hint of a smokey/burnt flavor which i assume is due to the roasted peppers. try it for yourself..this the most heat you can get without notifying the fire marshall ",positive
" this is the stuff hallucinogens bow before. the warning states that it's not for anyone with poor heart conditions high blood pressure or contemplating pregnancy ever. and it means it. one drop of this sauce in anything will have your eyes watering and your stomach curdling. why it's in a bottle this big i'll never know but this stuff is the real deal. i was foolish enough to have three drops in a shot of vodka one fateful night many moons ago and i still tremble at the memory. i can't rate it high enough so five stars will have to do ",positive
" so much better than buying those pre packaged microwave popcorns. always the way i like it ",positive
" i love this popcorn. i buy loads of it so i never run out. i don't know why this isn't the most popular popcorn out there. i don't think people know about it or maybe they don't want to have to cook it. but it's so easy and good ",positive
" this is probably the best popcorn you can make at home packaged with the whirley-pop stovetop popcorn popper and you have a great little gift set. sidenote: it probably isn't the healthiest popcorn for you (there is a lot of oil and butter flavoring) but it is the tastiest!! ",positive
" i tired real theater popcorn last night for the first time and managed to eat the entire thing by myself!! it was that good. if this isn't exactly like movie theater popcorn it's as close as it gets! i'm purchasing the 20 pack today and am going to hand out a few packs to my friends whom share the same love of popcorn that i do. it's good! ",positive
" i bought some of this for my husband last christmas with a stovetop popcorn popper (the kind with the stir rod.) now it's our favorite brand of popcorn and our favorite way to make it. the packages come with pre-measured oil & popping corn and you just cook it all up. each box has 5 bags. each bag makes a big bowl (?20 cups?) we only have to add salt and we love the taste. i highly recommend this with a stir rod popper too--either the stovetop or electric kind.

" i love lindt lindor chocolate truffles. i fell in love with the milk chocolate and since i am such a big white chocolate fan as well i had to try this one. its divine - i will give it that - but it tasted more like vanilla frosting than white chocolate. it felt like i was eating some sort of vanilla cake frosting out of a can than white chocolate so i was dissapointed that aspect. but it really is a great item despite that ",positive
" great product for chocolate lovers and social lovers alike. more of an end-of-the-night activity... unless you're just having a dessert party of course! my one complaint is the impractical (although oh-so-whimsical) tissue packaging. it is hazardously absorbent. even the assertive flavors of these high-quality chocolates are not enough to ward of infringing odors from nearby pantry items. note: do not store next to your curry sampler... best of luck chocoholics a & z ",positive
" i saw this at whole foods and bought it from there. i wanted something nice to bring to a house party and didn't feel like bringing flowers. it was a hit! it really is very pretty and memorable. it was one of a kind plus a small piece made a nice dessert with coffee. well worth the price. it would be fun for a chocolate tasting event.

" this was the best experience. i had mixed feelings about ordering food products and from a new company with amazon but it was wonderful. the leaves are just great and taste great too. they were very appologetic because of weather it shipped out a couple of days late but i still got them ontime. i can not wait to use all of the leaves to order (as well as more ingredients) from them.

" if it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. these chocolate are named after leonidas kestekidis who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur. when he moved back to belgium he not only married his true love he created chocolates the world now adores. when you taste these chocolates your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence these will impress. the i love you chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. each chocolate has a unique design and the i love you chocolate has two hearts ribbons and a seal. after you sample the variety of chocolates specific flavors will stand out as favorites. here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark white and milk chocolate depending on the selection: antoinette - a smooth brandy flavored ganache lingoit lait - absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate. irrsistible - dark chocolate and strawberry sauce. for ever - if you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. i ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. the milk chocolate and cherry filling is like claude debussy's rverie. it is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate. merveilleux - milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache. europe - dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling. ganache - milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache. tosca - milk chocolate with a special ganache. posie - dark chocolate and a cointreau filling. antoinette - delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling. eve - milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling. alexandre le grand - a milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream. also recommended: if you wish to also try the napolitains i'd suggest the 1 pound sampler ballotin with six varieties. you may also want to look for the new palet d'or. a deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. the center is made with butter cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations. leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. the chocolates are air freighted weekly from brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. my chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if i had purchased them in belgium. they were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. the boxes were then placed in protective styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. the expedited shipping is recommended from may to early september. ~therebeccareview.com ",positive
" these steaks were tender and tasted very good. so good in fact we ordered more ",positive
" this is a good selection of ingredients to start making sushi. it has everything you need except fillings but there are no instructions. i recommend getting a simple book like sushi made easy to give you the basics. i was pleased with the quality of the ingredients. i might buy this again if i find myself out of everything at once. ",positive
" this is really good. tender a little sweet. easy to make in the whirley pop and excellent with some cheddar & spice popcorn seasoning ",positive
" i love little white kernels of popped corn. this was good stuff but i think i'll try a larger white kernel to pop next time my preference ",positive
" pops great in the microwave. much better than many store brands. good product ",positive
" i won't claim to be a professional food taster ... i just know what i like and don't like. i don't like yellow popcorn i don't like microwave popcorn i like the white popcorn cooked in a pan. for my popping style the baby white pops great w/o lots of hard kernels. 'nuf said ",positive
" they got the texture and the level of sweetness just right. these were fabulous if a tad bit expensive. for a special treat i would buy these again ",positive
" this seller sent exactly what was described. fast shipping . well packed. thank yo ",positive
" so here's the deal i'm from omaha you can't go two miles without an omaha steaks store. here we just call em steaks. i can go to any butcher shop in omaha and buy steaks that are just as good if not better than anything omaha steaks has to offer for considerably less. this has always been my stance. that is until i had these these are quite simply the best steaks. yes they're expensive but if you're like my family and go out for steaks on birthday's you can actually save quite a bit by buying these instead. you won't get a better steak in a restaurant and my uncle's the head chef in a steak house i could be stabbed just for saying that. cooked rare to medium rare you can literally cut them with your fork they are more tender and have twice the flavor of any filet i've ever had. i can't stress to you how good these are. it's still the only steak i buy from omaha steaks but when you come from the land of steaks that's saying a lot. sorry texas you may have more cows but nebraska beef is simply better ",positive
" i was a little hesitant as to whether these would taste good or not however i was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. i will say this though i had the impression that the center was kind of creamy however it was solid which made it even better when allowing it to melt in your mout ",positive
" the kaffir lime leaves arrived very promptly and had been kept cool. they appear to be quite fresh. have cooked with them it was wonderful. thank ",positive
" i live in a small town and you can't buy these in the stores. they are very nice leaves some smaller but most very nice sized excellent for thai food. i froze mine so i should have enough to last at least a year ",positive
" haven't tried cooking with them yet. but they arrived quickly and are not damaged or bruised in any way. they are beautiful specimens. i immediately vacuum sealed and froze them ",positive
" in my case it was for my dad's birthday a couple days ago and it went great. i placed my order a week before the event (i know probably could have been too late) but it arrived 3 days later packaged really well in dry ice. if you're looking for a gift for a male relative you will never go wrong with getting him some omaha steaks ",positive
" gave this as a gift to my father for fathers day! he loved it! said the steaks arrived in excellent condition packed in dry ice and we're very enjoyable! one of the best fathers days gifts ",positive
" item as expected services average; shipping cost wasn't as ecconomical as i would have liked to have seen but obviously i paid it. i probably could have found the tea in a store but am hard pressed to get anywhere so... all-in-all everything went as expected ",positive
" i've bought all sizes shapes and scents and this is my hands-down favorite candle. the aroma is crisp and clean without being soapy fragrant without being overpoweringly floral. it's just refreshing and calming and strong enough to clear cooking smells from a kitchen. my only complaint is that it only comes in green which doesn't match my house.. ",positive
" had good taste but you sure couldn't make a sandwitch out of it. just big hunks of meat. its nothing like the pictures ",positive
" i have tried pretty much every brand of single serve coffe pods out there and i have found black mountain gold to be the richest and most flavorable. i highly recommend everyone to try this brand. ",positive
" i've tried lots of coffee pods and black mountain gold is by far the best!! the flavor is always full and rich never bitter. the guatemalan antigua decaf is delicious ",positive
" i'm on a low carb diet and didn't like just eating a bowl of plain tuna with mayo... yuck! i add a cup of dreamfield's elbows to give me a better lunch for only 5 net carbs and now i actually look forward to having tuna. also for 7 carbs you can add shredded cheese a drop of milk a pat of butter and pinch of salt to indulge yourself in a creamy macaroni with cheese dish! yummy :o ",positive
" i have used this pasta for two years. it has an excellent taste and consistency while being low carb. much better than whole wheat choices. i've tried all the selections and all i can say is i'm looking forward to the company adding rigatoni and acini de pepe sometime in the future. it's hard to find in restaurants but if you are ever in pittsburgh they serve it at gullifty's-wonderful. some diabetics may find it doesn't work for them--trial and error if you eat it because of diabetes.

" dean & deluca's basil can add delicious aromas to your crockpot cooking adventures. it is also perfect to add to a pot of steaming vegetables or to sprinkle on fish wrapped in puff pastry. the minute you open a tin of the dean & deluca basil you can sense the high-quality of the product and the aroma swirls into the air making you eager to try many of their herb and spice products. i especially love using this when making a homemade stock in my crockpot/slow cooker. it enhances soups vegetables and just about anything you sprinkle it on that is savory. this can also be used in salad dressings and is especially delicious used over pasta if you ever run out of fresh basil in the winter. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" the tin makes the world of difference. i purchased the large tin and have been using it for over 7 months. the spice still smells extremely fresh ",positive
" i have to admit i had little hope for the little sample of ground coffee that i received from amazon as part of a free promotional package to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. however against all odds i find millstone's product to be among the smoothest tasting coffees i've had from a package. understand that i am mainly part of the mobile starbucks-and-peets crowd that's used to the aftertaste of the wooden stirrer and the slightly curdled milk when i swallow my caffeine. normally i prefer grinding my own beans at home but given my predilection for my infrequently used french press maker i occasionally enjoy a heaping brew of the roasted colombian supremo. each of the sixteen packets is 1.75 ounces enough easily for about six cups. i say give it a try as a relatively convenient alternative to your normal coffee run ",positive
" ***** tazo's china green tips green tea is a slightly stronger green tea than tazo's zen and i liked that it doesn't contain tazo's omnipresent natural flavors that almost all of their other teas contain which to me is not an advantage. i like a natural real taste with real ingredients sans vague natural flavors and sans flavorings sans essences etc. china green tips delivers this in a cleaner purer way than tazo's other teas. i liked this green tea! the ingredients in china green tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from china. it contains caffeine. tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. china green tips has none of these natural flavors and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience. on the paper tea packet tazo writes a traditional chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor. this is the perfect way to describe this tea! on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of china green tips as grassy vegetative sweet ricey. tazo describes the aroma as vegetative popcorn. i would rate this tea and tazo in general as very good---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not as good as numi or aspen. still this tea is excellent so i'm breaking my tradition with tazo teas and giving it five stars. if you enjoy super premium teas and are stuck with tazo for some reason choose china green tips and you will be quite satisfied. i can't honestly say that about any other tazo tea. **** ",positive
" this is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. the taste is barley sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. the aftertaste is very mild and fresh. green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!! green tea averages about 10-30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee. tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box ",positive
" you can get better tea if you're willing to deal with leaves but that's not practical for most of us especially for those who drink it at work like i do. compare this to a budget-brand bagged green tea (like salada which i used to drink) and you'll be able to tell the difference right away. the tazo isn't overbearingly flavorful (no green tea is) but its subtle green taste is addictive (as is the caffeine!)

" since my husband perfected his technique of grilling omaha steak filet mignon we no longer order steak when we go out to dinner. even at the most expensive fanciest restaurants their steak just isn't as good as what my husband does on the grill with these omaha steaks. ",positive
" hands down the best steaks i have ever had. i scoff at people who would refer to them as dry: they simply don't know how to cook steak. we have been buying omaha steaks products for 4 years. no i am not a butcher but i do enjoy a good steak. in terms of value: $6-$8 for a steak would scare me if i saw it on a menu at a restaurant -- these steaks are value. there are no supermarkets in my area that can compete with these cuts of beef. these days there are not a lot of products or companies out there who deliver consistent quality but omaha steaks is one company who continues to impress me.

" despite being a member of the solanaceae or often-deadly nightshade family (native to the americas) i find tomatoes to be relatively friendly to my innards. while i feel that masquerading as a vegetable is a bit deceptive (they are technically a berry) i am quite a fan of the tomato and find the notion that they were originally known as love apples to be rather quaint and charming - not to mention tender juicy and delicious. so tender and delicious. mmmmmm ",positive

" i've said it before i'll say it again - i'm a white gal who likes to throw her ample weight around! i find these cupcakes to second only to the mighty ding dong when it comes to hostess treats. the chocolate cake is great and the frosting is absolutely delectable. avoid the bastardization that is the golden hostess cupcake ",positive
" this food calls back to my youth. i'm still always impressed that these things can stay as moist as they do. this is a major plus. i'm really not so keen on the whole frosting thing and this one still finds me wanting with the urge to be sick just thinking about eating the filling. but more power to them for having the retro cool thing going on and the ability to foist them off on adult aquaintences in need of a snack ",positive
" delicious hostess chocolate cupcakes were the first hostess cupcakes. you can now get orange flavored hostess cupcakes as well. while homemade cupcakes are still the best if you have too little time to whip up a batch of cupcakes when these cupcakes are fresh they are hard to beat. they have a soft chocolate cake body with a creamy middle and chocolate icing on top. the only problem with these cupcakes is that they are addictive and those of us who spend too little time on the treadmill need to watch home many of these things that we eat both at one time and altogether. well i hear a hostess cupcake calling my name..

" **** tazo's lotus decaffeinated green tea is one of my favorite tazo teas. the lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful. this tea is not bitter or harsh in any way. it is one of the most natural-tasting of the tazo's i've tasted very subtle and much less artificial-tasting. the ingredients in lotus are: naturally decaffeinated green tea natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. of course this tea is caffeine-free. tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. on the paper tea packet tazo writes delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower. on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of lotus as peach nutty flowery overripe melon. this surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied with an aroma reminiscent of freesia. tazo also describes the aroma as tropical fruit green tea. hmmm...i don't taste all of these various flavors and i suspect that tazo really pushes the creative writing limit. i taste green tea and a nice flowery flavor which i'm assuming is the lotus but not the rest---the peach nuts melon freesia tropical fruit---they're missing from what i can discern here. i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not as good as numi. i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo lotus gets only four stars. *** ",positive
" this is the story of two tazo teas. i found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. i tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. tazo lotus and tazo wild sweet orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. the way i make this tea is by steeping two lotus and two wild sweet orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. i make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. then you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. lotus decaffeinated green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. wild sweet orange is a blend of lemongrass blackberry leaves citric acid rose hips spearmint leaves natural flavors orange peel safflowers hibiscus flowers rose petals natural orange essence ginger root and licorice root. i love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. the boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. a romantic tea with a golden-orange color. i can never decide if i like this best hot or cold so i end up drinking it hot and cold. half on ice and half in a mug. when this tea is hot it is much more romantic and aromatic. when chilled it takes on a more bitter component. for something even more exotic try the tazo green ginger tea. ~the rebecca review ",positive

" how can you not love the twinkie? it's compact delicious and aerodynamic. if you actually look at the ingredients twinkies are made of flour water shortening eggs sugar... sound familiar? it's cake. there are some preservatives added to increase shelf life but they make up a very small percentage of the overall treat. the air we breathe probably contains more dangerous 'additives' than a twinkie. let us face facts; if one were to eat slice after slice of chocolate cake baked using organic ingredients that person is going to end up in coronary bypass land just as quickly as if one gorged on twinkies. twinkies like anything in moderation are just fine ",positive

" green bell peppers are very versatile; great for stuffed peppers salads or sauteeing with italian sausage. i'm a big fan of all peppers and would give most all peppers a high rating...i had to bump the bell pepper down a star for its low rating on the scoville scale. bell peppers rate a 0 on this scale of hotness. just a little bit of spiciness would make these peppers a definite 5-star vegetable due to its versatility and delicious capsaicin taste...but alas the bell pepper is void of that magical capsaicin and thus a 4-star vegetable ",positive
" these coffee pods were delicious. i my co-worker and a doctor with whom i had to share these with so they could experience them also loved this cinnamon swirl flavored coffee. the deliver was super fast. a great transaction ",positive
" these pods work well with my simplehuman coffee maker. and i can get both an 8 oz. cup and an additional 5 ozs out of each pod. taste of the mocha cinnamon swirl is balanced and not too sweet. but do some comparison shopping - if you buy directly from the java podz website the cost of both the pods and the s/h are lower than buying through amazon ",positive

" these burgers are unbelievable. they are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger. they are omaha steaks best product and the only thing i order from them. i actually love the packaging. each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic which means i can keep them in the freezer until i am ready to eat them. then defrost them in warm water and in 10 minutes i have fresh red meat they have a nice peppery angus beef smell and they taste great. they never go to waste. i find the meat i buy in the stores these days can't compare at all. them smell of the meat doesn't smell fresh - more like plastic than meat. ok the styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times. amazon also has a great price on these. after a quick search around the web this looks to be the best price ",positive

" i bought seven beans for seven dollars and was a bit unimpressed with the aromatic quality. they didn't have that strong complex aroma right out of the bag that bourbon beans are known for. that is not to say that the inside of the bean isn't aromatic. after all it's the guts that really count. even though these beans don't seem to be as aromatic as other beans this is still a killer deal!!! i recently purchased one bean from a popular brand spice islands for seven dollars. an unbelievably aromatic bean but seven times the cost of these beans!?!?!? i think i'll just buy these and use twice as many as the higher quality beans. i'm still making away like a bandit ",positive
" first off top notch customer service- there's a personal touch that's rarely seen in on-line purchasing! please keep it up! now for the goods: these vanilla beans are a fantastic value. seriously i wasn't expecting much- i was hopeful given the other reviews- but i've learned some hard lessons to not expect such high standards of quality- especially when it comes to gourmand items- these beans are even superior to those i can get from my local provider (at three times the cost mind you.) i've even ordered online from two other sources (one recommended by martha stewart lol)- and these beans are plumper and more supple than those other pricier providers. (plump and supple- always a good thing.) if you're on the fence- i urge you to go for it. you owe it to your recipes to use quality indredients. you will not be disappointed. i know i'm not. thank you kindly ",positive

" **** tazo's decaffeinated chai black tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. on the paper tea packet tazo writes a rich blend of full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas and exotic aromatic spices. on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of decaffeinated chai as creamy vanilla sweet and pungent spices. tazo describes the aroma as sweet spice. those are pretty accurate. the black tea blend is a little bitter though even with minimal brewing. it's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter. the ingredients in decaffeinated chai are: naturally decaffeinated black teas rooibos cinnamon ginger cardamom chicory cloves black pepper natural flavors and star anise. it is caffeine-free! tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not as good as numi. i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo decaffeinated chai gets only four stars. *** ",positive

" clark's teaberry gum became the rage in the 1960s when herb alpert and the tijuana brass played the teaberry shuffle. originally produced by the d l clark company who got their fame with the clark bar the gum is a pittsburgh favorite for over 100 years. the mild flavor is somewhere between wintermint and a very faint touch of cinnamon that somehow gives it a bit of a tea taste. it is a very sublte flavore which is to me much more refreshing than the extra-strong gums from the other guys. there is also a sugar-free variet ",positive
" d. l. clark company was founded in 1886 in pittsburg pennsylvania. the company was best known for its chocolate clark bar which was sent over bulk to america's w.w.1 soldiers who formed a lifelong attachment to it. since its founding the company has changed hands many times. teaberry gum has a flavor that is hard to describe as it really doesn't taste like anything else. it is smooth and sweet with a taste you will never forget. when i was young a local drug store carried a wide range of candies including teaberry gum. whenever i could i would go and buy a pack and to this day the teaberry taste takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy. so if you want a great gum that tastes like no other gum out there then buy teaberry gum. it's fantastic!

" blend a little apple cider mix into your tazo passion tea and see what happens. this creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land. snuggle up spiced cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire but packets of cider work equally well. this is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. apple cider also works very well with the gypsy teas especially the lemon jasmine. the deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of tazo tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. yet is this really tea? it looks like tea but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers orange peel licorice cinnamon rose hips lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water. the original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. tazo teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. so far i've tried more flavors than i can count and have always been impressed. ~the rebecca review ",positive

" i received a very well packaged (and promptly shipped even) package of the habanero jerky from mahogany smoked meats. the jerky itself it obviously made from good meat (vs some of the garbage you'd get from oberto or whomever). the initial smell is excellent. an aroma of pepper and brown sugar. however the jerky itself is somewhat sticky. the pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. after you're done your hands are all sticky. my guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator we'd have a drier product that tasted just as well. as for how spicy. well my lips are burning. i like that. i really love habanero (and in fact grow several varieties at home). this isn't some &quot;slightly spicy&quot; product with the name habanero in it to make it seem macho. it will scorch your mouth. in my opinion scorch in a good way. the price is great. you'd spend that much at any store buying a far lower quality of jerky and just try finding habanero anything at safeway. kudos to amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. additional kudos to mahogany smoked meats for having such a wonderful product. i've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (i guess it's the sugar?) and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves. definitely recommended ",positive

" i'm only a little bit of a coffee nut but i really like this coffee. my fiance's father brought some back from costa rica while he was there on business. i have just finished my bag and already miss it. this was one of the best coffees i have tasted. well balanced not too acidic not too bitter just right in my opinion. it's really good served traditionally hot but it's also great iced. and as with all coffees... it's best if you get whole bean and grind it yourself. my opinion... a must try ",positive
" if you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation then i highly suggest you without haste purchase one pound at least of whole bean jbm. also a good grinder a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. pre-ground takes much of the flavor away compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water. but why something so expensive? why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet? some may scoff saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. that is entirely true. but how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged? thus why this review is only four out of five stars. you see jbm is so subtle so complex that a new tounge will not notice what makes jbm quite so wonderful. it is a perfectly blended coffee. flavor bitterness acidity and aftertaste. on a scale of one to ten they all rank dead even at five. every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean. this should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things. how else can you truely understand the other blends ",positive

" rooibos is afrikaans for red bush. grown in south africa's cederburg mountains and harvested during the summer this tea acquires its unique red color as a result of fermentation (in mounds) and oxidization when it is spread out to dry in the sunlight; naturally it is green. rooibos is known for its health benefits stemming from its rich content in vitamins antioxidants flavanoids and minerals (inter alia magnesium calcium iron copper zinc potassium fluoride manganese and alpha-hydroxy) and has a long tradition of medicinal use among the local native population; among other things it is known to help cure asthma hay fever and other allergies acne eczema colics indigestion insomnia and nervous tension. containing very few tannins and no caffeine rooibos has a distinctive aroma and amber color. this tea blends well with various spices and condiments; my favorite mixture is a delicious loose leaf blend sold by my local tea store which features orange peel cinnamon grated coconut finely minced chili and red pepper. for a more commercial alternative though tazo's red bush tea is a great choice as well: a rich exquisite blend of rooibos hibiscus orange peel rosemary several lemon ingredients (lemon myrtle verbena and balm) as well as a number of sweet spices. enjoy ",positive
" i purchased this tea with scepticism because i am a big rooibus fan--i get organic rooibus tea loose and brew it strong with cream. in general i think rooibus is a good tea that stands on its own--does not need additions. however in this case rooibus was used as a base for a nice clean herbal tea blend. the flavor of rooibus is just the base note. congratulations to tazo for their light touch with hibiscus--if this tea is brewed properly--4 minutes max--it is light and refreshing. the touch of rosemary really adds a nice freshness to the blend. if you brew it too long it does decline into a sourness that overshadows the subltety of the other flavors. i use this when i want a simple herbal tea with no milk ",positive

" after growing up in africa one becomes rather fond of rooibos tea and i never thought the day would arrive when i would recommend anything but a pure rooibos tea. tazo has taken rooibos tea to a new level by blending african rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus lemon myrtle lemon verbena orange peel rosemary and lemon balm. rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of a fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an african veld fire. i remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. now i mix in powdered milk and honey. honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend. for some reason this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel. i've recently rediscovered the health benefits of rooibos although i can truly say i've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. rooibos is naturally sweet very aromatic and is high in magnesium calcium iron and copper. mothers in africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic. an application of cold rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies indigestion insomnia and nervous tension. just drinking the tea seems to improve your skin due to the high antioxidant levels 50 times that of green tea! this is one of the tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. if you enjoy this tea you might also want to try tazo honeybush tea. i must say that the tazo company really has my attention with their packaging amusing tales of ancient tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection. ~therebeccareview.com ",positive

" my kid was upset when i got him an improvised harry potter broom for christmas--o.k. it wasn't an officially licensed product but since magic brooms are imaginary anyway any stick with a bunch of straw at one end is as good as any other. but no--apparently a corn lobby broom wasn't good enough for him. anyway he wouldn't talk to me for a month which was good at first but then got really annoying. for my kid's birthday i decided to get him something really special so i got him this bag of xanthan gum. i even wrapped it up real nice with wrapping paper and ribbon. my kid opened his present and couldn't figure out what it was. it's xanthan gum i told him it's gum from outer space. from the planet xanthan. my kid was busy staring at the label. no it's not he slowly replied and then he began to read 'xanthan is made from the outer layer of a tiny inactive bacterium called xanthomonas campestris... from the planet xanthan! i interrupted. since when did my kid learn to read? i grabbed the bag and opened it. here i stuck a spoon into the white powder try some. it's really good. my kid picked up the spoon and smelled the white powder. go on i said you'll really like it! he hesitated and then stuck his tongue into the powder. i was starting to get impatient so i grabbed the spoon from him give it to me you big chicken and then i swallowed the powder. the stuff dissolved into a thick slimy paste in my mouth but i smiled as i chewed it mmmmm... this is the tastiest xanthan gum in the whole universe! my kid looked at me as if i were lying. if you like it so much then you can have it he said. fine i replied it's too good for you anyway. i figured a little reverse psychology would do the trick. my kid's expression didn't change. can i go now? he asked. yeah fine get out here i said. now i'm stuck with half a pound of xanthan gum and i don't know anyone with wheat allergies or celiac disease i can give this stuff to. stupid kid ",positive

" ***** tazo's china green tips green tea is a slightly stronger green tea than tazo's zen and i liked that it doesn't contain tazo's omnipresent natural flavors that almost all of their other teas contain which to me is not an advantage. i like a natural real taste with real ingredients sans vague natural flavors and sans flavorings sans essences etc. china green tips delivers this in a cleaner purer way than tazo's other teas. i liked this green tea! the ingredients in china green tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from china. it contains caffeine. note that this review is for the loose tea leaves (in other words no tea bags!). tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. china green tips has none of these natural flavors and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience. on the accompanying information with the product tazo writes a traditional chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor. this is the perfect way to describe this tea! on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of china green tips as grassy vegetative sweet ricey. tazo describes the aroma as vegetative popcorn. i would rate this tea and tazo in general as very good---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not as good as numi or aspen. still this tea is excellent so i'm breaking my tradition with tazo teas and giving it five stars. if you enjoy super premium teas and are stuck with tazo for some reason choose china green tips and you will be quite satisfied. i can't honestly say that about any other tazo tea. **** ",positive

" these egg whites work great and are economical. i recently started a diet where i can only eat egg whites. it seems such a waste to throw out the yolks not to mention the mess of separating the eggs. i use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods. adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods. the powdered egg whites do have an eggy odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets ",positive

" sing in me oh muse on this snow day and let me proclaim the many virtues of this fine tea. the scent and flavor of this tea are as close to my conception of ambrosia as anything else that has yet crossed my palate. it is full without being overbearing it is seasoned without being overpowering. it's great with anything from english breakfast fare to hardy curry. since conception i have been in love with tea but the prince was my first fine tea. i have still not recovered from the episode in which my father-in-law-to-be proved to me that bag tea was a crime against humanity. and yet despite amorous flirtations with rare white teas and other wondrous indian and chinese estate varieties with unpronounceable names it's still my favourite. never mind the tea purist snobs who rank on it because it's flavored with spice. would they send back a fine filet because the chef elected to use some pepper or shallots? ignore the herbal tea-totalers who regard caffeine as sinful. they probably want to outlaw yoga on sunday too. of the five or so kousmichoff varieties i've had this one is the clear winner. i've gotten my best results using hot water steeping for five to six minutes. the stuff is potent enough that you can get gasp a reasonably tannin-free second infusion. my only reservation is this; once you've entered the universe of fine tea you can never be satisfied drinking lipton salada twinings or tetley again. in guise of gifts i have managed to get many of my gastronome friends and relations addicted so that i may sup of it when i visit. isn't it a delicious irony that perhaps the greatest bourgeoisie decadence of the romanoff dynasty is today preserved by our friends in socialist france? viva la revolution! rws 26/1/0 ",positive

" okay maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... red popcorn has a much more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear. when it pops it looks pretty much like any other popcorn except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual. the meet is white but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them. you would never know that the pretty white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping. the flavor is great! it smelled toastier as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried. we tried it all different ways with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good. we also liked the fact that it is grown by amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the old way. they believe in sustainable farming and a clean wholesome way of life. no conagra multi-national conglomerates here just real individual farmers making a living off their land. great products raised and produced by real farmers. what better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!

" the product description calls the orangettes belgian vitamin c. except for the luxury price i'm sure belgians must be pretty healthy with these around. they're amazing! the combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular but leonidas does it very well. the dark chocolate is very rich not bitter and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet). unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion. the result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying. i don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health but they will definitely improve your day. in my opinion they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try. the packaging is a gold box wrapped in blue and white leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box. for shipping the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell. mine arrived within three days and looked like i'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift ",positive

" marmite is great. its like eating the stuff you would scrape off the sole of your shoe after you'd been walking around in an old factory for a day. i think it tells about the character of a small island population that came to rule the world. thank god they left before they had the rest of us eating this filth ",positive
" for those of us brought up on vegemite marmite doesn't make the grade. for those brought up on marmite vegemite seems a poor substitute. for americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake (oops i mean bread) both are revolting. i think that a major reason why americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast they tend to use like quantities of vegemite or marmite. to uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming. before passing judgment on these spreads you would do well to heed the advice of joanna or mtspace and apply thinly. it also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast. incidentally i believe that marmite was first. vegemite was an australian imitation created several years later. it was originally called parwill - a pun which will be appreciated by aussies and brits but which may not be understood by americans because of the way the words are pronounced. i only give marmite four stars. that probably tells you my upbringing ",positive
" i went to uk for the first time a couple of years back. my friends introduced me to marmite as something some people enjoyed when they couldn't afford eggs and bacon. the mr said it was made from a by-product of beer i thought he was joking at first. spread it thinly on a piece of dry toast served properly he demonstrated then handed to me. it was surprisingly strong but i liked it. savory [or savoury as they would spell it] like bacon or other cooked meats but none of the awful fat or grease. it's not terribly hard to find here since the advent of shopping with the wonderful world wide web so i have been able to enjoy this in the us as a snack between meals on one slice of whole wheat bread often a late night sandwich with room temperature cheese and tomato. ",positive
" marmite is the greatest thing since sliced bread. it is the thing that most ex-pats miss. but it is most definitely not vegemite. that is an entirely different thing. well - not that entirely different maybe. but to my mind marmite is far superior. it tastes 'meatier' is a glorious glossy brown/black colour comes in a much nicer jar and makes a lovely drink. 1 teaspoon in a mug of hot water in which you dunk thick slices of buttered bread. lived on this when a poor student ",positive
" my first culinary memory involves a surreptitious finger dip into the marmite jar at the age of three; it is the first food i remember really loving. and ever since then i have had difficulty getting enough of it. not everyone reacts to it the same way. some imagine it looks too much like axle grease. others complain that it smells too much like beer left overnight to go bad. these facts suggest that one might only serve it to close friends and only when there are some alternatives. in any case the marmite claim love it or hate it is quite apropos. it rarely evokes a neutral reaction. the best preparation i can think of is to mix it thoroughly with butter. one part marmite to two or three parts butter. then spread thinly on toast. served this way the primary flavor of marmite is salt. then there is a subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it's a flavor that is present in well browned mushrooms or red meat. the label suggests that it might be put to excellent use in soup stocks as a substitute or supplement to caramelized roasted vegetables - onions and carrots. as for nutritional value even spread thinly it is dynamite. those who fall hopelessly for its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses of a few crucial b vitamins. it is an exceptionally rich source of b12 folicin and b6. and since it is free of animal products it is an ideal food to include in a vegan diet which normally falls short in delivering b12.

" **** tazo's chai black tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. on the paper tea packet tazo writes a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the himalayas. on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of chai as cinnamon creamy sweet spice and medium-bodied yet full-flavored with the spicy kick of cinnamon ginger cardamom and black pepper. tazo describes the aroma as sweet spice. those are pretty accurate. the black tea blend is a little bitter though even with minimal brewing. it's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter. the ingredients in chai are: black teas ginger cinnamon black pepper cardamom cloves and star anise. it is caffeinated. tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not as good as numi. i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo chai gets only four stars. *** ",positive

" after reading the reviews i was hesitant. however i've gotten a perfect cup every time so far with my senseo. the coffee is very good but it has fallen a little short of my expectations. i've previously brought kona back from my hawaiian vacations and ground it myself. the pod coffee is not quite as good as fresh ground. update: for my next shipment this two-cup style was backordered. aloha island coffee co. sent me the equivalent amount of coffee in single-cup style pods instead. i've found these pods to work better fit the senseo machine better and this coffee now does tasted just as good (or better) than fresh ground whole bean kona! i think the single-pod style is quite a bit more expensive than two-cup style but the difference is definitely noticeable ",positive
" these kona pods are the highest quality pods that i have found yet. i love kona coffee so i was extremely pleased to find these pods. they certainly cost a little more than other cheap pods but it's worth it especially when you consider what you pay for a cup of coffee at retail. now i have the best coffee in the world at home for less...

" yes the coffee is the best quality pesticide free. there are technical issues with the pods. 1 pod was broken when i opened up the pouch it was stored in. for any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable. also many times the pod is not working but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work (i have black & decker home cafe machine). great coffee but i felt that i had to really work for it. i also feel that to charage $15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive considering that they are being shiped from la not hi ",positive
" as a bachelor who frequently must grab a cup of joe at home and run i was reluctant to waste coffee in my braun drip machine and disinclined to clean up after the french press method. a new york times article convinced me that a pod system would be the way to go and i found the philips senseo machine to be the best at the consumer level. alas the douwe egberts pods that come with are um imho not good. a brief web search led me to aloha island's senseo-style pods and i ordered a box of their single serving espresso pods. the package arrived swiftly and the box of pods was swaddled in styro-peanuts: nice touch! i immediately placed a pair in the senseo unit and let it do its thing. wow! the quality of the coffee is to date unparalled. rich smooth and frothy almost like a latte before the milk is added. and i was surprised that the yield was about one ounce greater than with the de pods. i'm a believer an advocate and a confirmed drinker and fan. thanks and mahalo ",positive

" this sauce is medium heat for everyday use. it has an excellent roasted pepper flavor and there is *no vinegar* to get in the way. consequently you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it. an every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue. this is not a boutique novelty it's a household staple. the 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household. you want good? try tapatio on cottage cheese. you'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again i promise. i use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream but my personal favorite applications of tapatio are: eggs potatoes pizza anything creole (forget tabasco!) cottage cheese most rice mac cheese and of course...mex in my opinion this is the best sauce in your local grocery store ",positive

" i love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn. it is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other gourmet salts but it is only 15 cents per ounce not 15 dollars. note that this salt is flaked unlike the normal crystals for which diamond salt is known. it absolutely clings to the surface of the popcorn fries and other similarly-textured foods much better. it has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and clean is always good in my book. as a treat i sometimes iick the tip of my index finger sprinkle a little of this on it and then pretend like i'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter but without the lime. almost like a couple of hours on the beach. i can only give it four stars instead of five because it is not iodized and you could end up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine. this is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood but if you live in the midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties.

" **** tazo's wild sweet orange herbal infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. it contains lemongrass blackberry leaves citric acid rose hips spearmint leaves natural flavors orange peel safflowers hibiscus flowers rose petals natural orange essence ginger root and licorice root. it is not sweet very fruity and not subtle at all a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas. tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. on the paper tea packet tazo writes a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. sweet yet tart this is a cup of liquid sunshine radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. wild indeed. on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of wild sweet orange as tart sweet smooth licorice. tazo describes the aroma as oranges roses lime. this is pretty accurate although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches. i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not as good as numi. i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo wild sweet orange gets only four stars. *** ",positive
" this is the story of two tazo teas. i found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. i tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. tazo lotus and tazo wild sweet orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. the way i make this tea is by steeping two lotus and two wild sweet orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. i make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. then you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. lotus decaffeinated green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. wild sweet orange is a blend of lemongrass blackberry leaves citric acid rose hips spearmint leaves natural flavors orange peel safflowers hibiscus flowers rose petals natural orange essence ginger root and licorice root. i love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. the boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. a romantic tea with a golden-orange color. i can never decide if i like this best hot or cold so i end up drinking it hot and cold. half on ice and half in a mug. when this tea is hot it is much more romantic and aromatic. when chilled it takes on a more bitter component. for something even more exotic try the tazo green ginger tea. that was the first tazo tea i tasted and so far i can't think of a tazo tea i don't love. ~the rebecca review ",positive

" tazo teas is a relative newcomer to the tea market having been founded in 1994 by steve smith. but what tazo lacks in history it makes up for in pure inventiveness! among tazo's many blends is passion a bold and flavorful mixture of hibiscus flowers other tropical flavors citric acid orange peel licorice root cinnamon bark rose hips lemongrass and red poppy. brew it up and you are rewarded with a bright red infusion that has a tart and exciting taste. now this tea is definitely not for everyone. as you can tell from the ingredients this tea is strong and decidedly on the tart side. when drunk hot you probably will want to sweeten it with honey or moderate it with milk or possibly both. but when made into an iced tea passion really comes into its own - decidedly refreshing and thirst-quenching. just what you need for a hot summer day! so overall i would say that this is a pretty darn good hot tea and a great iced tea. buy some today ",positive

" the deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. yet is this really tea? it looks like tea but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers orange peel licorice cinnamon rose hips lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water. the flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. this tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and i think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey. i recently discovered tazo teas ad have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. so far i've tried most of the flavors and have been impressed. i do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients. caffeine free. you can drink this as you type into the night... ~therebeccareview.com ",positive

" neuske's bacon is simply the most divine bacon eating experience you'll ever have. smoked in wisconsin over applewood it is delectable luscious even. they cut it lean so that there is no rubbery fatty bits like you find in store-bought brands yet they leave enough in to give it that robust flavor. it is worth noting that america's test kitchen did a taste test of bacon in which neuske's was a participant. it did not come out as no.1 because tasters thought it was too smoky. if you like smoky bacon like i do that sounds like crazy talk and you should definitely try this bacon. the results of the taste test indicates to me that there are those who prefer their bacon less smoky and i suppose that if you are one of those people you may not like this bacon after all (even thought it is the best ever). be careful though: once you eat neuske's and love it you won't be satisfied with store-bought ever again ",positive

" i just brewed my first batch and this is by far the best green tea i've tried. my family will have to live with less this batch because my first sample cup quickly turned into 3 big cups! yummmmmmmm. don't know what some of the other folks here are talking about when they say it smells/tastes bad. smells just like some of the better-quality green tea in teabags but stronger sweeter and much richer. taste is smoother no bitterness much fuller and surprisingly long-lasting. i'm no tea connoisseur i just know what i like and this one is awesome. a little research on the web helped. the general consensus seems to be that 160-180 degree water is the best brewed about 2 minutes. i don't have a thermometer or anything fancy so i brought the water just to boiling and waited 5 minutes before using. brewed 2 minutes then poured through a strainer into a pitcher. if you're willing to go through a bit of extra trouble you can use the same leaves up to 3 times. a little goes a long way. i used about 2 rounded tablespoons brewed 3 times and got more than a full pitcher of nice strong tea. i like my tea strong and it looks like 2 level tablespoons would still do the job nicely. use less for something milder ",positive

" i gave g collection to my wife. it's perfect valentine present for her! most of chocolates are fruit-based but very unique and fresh. i'm not a big fan of chocolate but this one is amazing ",positive
" whether enjoyed as a gift for others or yourself there is something about the g collection that consistently leaves you wishing for just one more piece. the brown-and-lime faux-leather box a treat for the eyes in itself contains 15 pieces of what can only be described as godiva's most ambitious and delicious chocolates to date. the 15-piece g collection closely mirrors the more expensive american pies collection but provides many unique and otherwise unobtainable pieces that more than justify the cost of the set. the rich all-encompassing flavor of the g collection's fruit pieces is on par with the american pies collection: key lime and cherry stand out bursting from their fragile sugar-coated shells with an intense and supremely enjoyable tang. a box of this size ought to last - one will quickly find that the richness (to overuse the word) marks these candies as individual luxuries to be enjoyed over time. simply scarfing these down simply will not to justice to the complex excellent job godiva has done in blending different ingredients to make authentic mouth-watering flavors. godiva's g collection can never be explained satisfactorily until they are tried. only on the tastebuds can an accurate and deserving review of these milestone candies be written ",positive
" unless you were a wealthy chocoholic you would probably never blow the 50$ on these. as a gift however this is a great box (there is a similar all heart shaped box for valentines - which is cool if you dig hearts). it fits all the qualities i look for in a gift. its extravagant its something the person i give it to will love and its something they wouldn't get themselves. i tried 2 of these the mixed berry is ridiculously good. the peanut butter and jelly was interesting. everything is superb quality wise. i knock it down a bit on price but honestly its tough to find fault in this product. it much much better than regular godiva (which i find to be super sweet and overpriced) ",positive
" regular godiva pieces are great but they're still chocolate. i actually dislike some regular godiva pieces (truffles are too sweet and caramels are similar to see's caramels). but the g collection is fantstic. the presentation is stunning from the packaging to the airbrushed pieces. and the taste is incredible. the original flavors gave me pause (peanut butter and jelly?) but they work so so well and taste better than any chocolate i've ever had. each piece averages to $3 but every piece is way better than $3 of candy bars or ice cream. most pieces are better than $12 desserts from 5-star restaurants. so while the price seems extreme once you taste a piece you will understand that it so worth it. a perfect gift for a discerning chocolate lover and for yourself ",positive
" ah these godiva pieces of chocolate are incredible. they are crunchy and incredibly delicious. whenever i have to make a lasting impression i buy godiva and the lady is always thrilled. this brand is the very best when it comes to chocolate and this gift box is one of their best. ",positive
" i am a huge fan of tasty bite products and was delighted to find that amazon now stocks them since they are expensive in my small town (no trader joe's here!). i was excited to see this variety that i had never tried before and readily ordered the six pack of these noodles with peanut sauce expecting the same ready-to-eat food that the other tasty bites i have tried offer. but unlike their ready-to-eat rice dishes in which the rice and the packet merely need heating but are already fully cooked the noodles here are in their raw state and need to be boiled for ten minutes so you can't grab this and bring it to work the way you can most other tasty bite meals. also the peanut sauce has a delectable and complex flavor but is spiced and textured so that i felt it really needed some vegetables and or meat to round it out. i love spicy dishes but this meal seemed planned to be overly spiced so that when you add the veggies and meat it would be perfect. so as a quick meal starter at home or as a way of helping to use up leftover meat and veggies this gets five stars. it was delicious. some additions i have enjoyed are chicken steak bell pepper cauliflower carrots eggplant and sweet potato. but i am giving this meal four stars overall because my expectation from eating other tasty bite entrees was that this was a grab and go meal that i could pop in the microwave and have prepared in a couple of minutes.

" once you see the book that accompanies this starter kit you will realize two things. you won't be making sushi anytime soon without a few more items. not only do you need fresh ingredients you need things that are listed in the recipes to make miso to make number-one dashi and number-two dashi. you need bonito flakes and kombu you need things like bamboo leaves too. ok so you don't need bamboo leaves but having a bamboo plant around the house wouldn't hurt. the book is especially helpful but to make the sushi rice professionally you do need to also order a rice-cooling tub (hangiri). a square omelet pan is needed but not essential. you can adapt by using a regular pan. just add your fresh ingredients is the understatement of the year. you do get a sushi press a sushi mat and nishiki sushi rice. the sushi nori is essential as is the ginger wassabi soy sauce rice vinegar sweet wine (mirin) and white sesame seeds. other items you will want to have on hand when this arrives: chopsticks ginger grater chopping board fish knives (sushi knives) plates for serving sushi (not essential but make it more interesting) skewers - for when you cook shrimp rice maker stainless steel colander wooden rice paddle - or you can use a wooden spoon ingredients: avocados cucumber carrots asparagus chives eggplant daikon radish fresh shiitake mushrooms lotus root kombu miso paste ocha - tea sake shiso - an aromatic herb snow peas sushi vinegar called awasezu tofu - various types but japanese silken is recommended wakame seaweed recommended seafood selections include: mackerel salmon crabs blue-eye cod tuna herring sea bass and numerous other selections. i will be making mine with cooked fish for the most part and many of the recipes indicate cooking the shrimp. the book gives excellent full-color picture step-by-step instructions for preparing seafood. everything from cleaning squid to angled cuts for sahimi. prepare to learn an ancient art form. this is serious cooking with gourmet appeal. there are instructions for making garnishes and dipping sauces. the tuna rolls are probably going to be one of the first items to make because they have few ingredients and you don't need anything except a rice cooker sushi vinegar and the rolling mat. the california-roll-style temaki-zushi also look fairly tame. the nigiri-zushi made in sushi bars seem a little more complex. to make a simple inari-zushi you need tofu and there are extensive instructions for how to make the little packets or pouches for rice. these seem very interesting and i've tasted them before and definitely look forward to trying to make them. the idea of a chirashi-zushi rice bowl is interesting and does not require a great deal of artistic application. so if you want to make a full sushi meal it gets a little more complex but you can try out various recipes and master the dashi which is like a fish stock/soup made with kombu and bonito flakes. this knowledge is of course needed to make the sushi rice which leads me right back to needing a hangiri. i suppose you can use a glass bowl instead. this sushi kit is truly only a brief start to an artistic journey. even after ordering this you may find you need a few more items before you can start taking steps in the direction of actually making sushi. i will report back as i try various recipes and all i can say is this will require an adventurous spirit and a few more amazon orders. once you have the sushi book things start to become more clear and you can make a list of things to order. ~the rebecca review ",positive

(once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - i realized i was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)i am not familiar with various grades of matcha but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because i wanted to control the sugar etc. i make my frappuccino like this: sorry - i do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because i am guessing! 1 1/2c milk 2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder 1/8c simple syrup (i make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so) 10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes) blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - i scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (simple syrup is 1c water 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) it is much easier than it may sound - i make these daily in the morning. i hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the gt frappuccino - it is slightly different (i think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup) but i liked mine more within the first week of having them!

" good stuff! while this tea is not very tasty it is: 1) very easy to prepare 2) very inexpensive 3) comes in a nice container 4) it is very good for you!! i have felt really good since drinking this 4-5 times a day and have lost a full pant size in just a few weeks! so endure the bitter taste and be energetic and healthy!!!

" i suppose i'm unsophisticated about matcha teas since this is the first i've tried but i really really enjoy this matcha. it's smooth mellow and slightly sweet. i'm picky about loose green teas for steeping; some of those are bitter & i don't like bitter tea. so my favorite teas are this matcha & white loose leaf teas. the cost is honestly too steep for me to buy other better rated matcha for the flavor so i'm happy i can get this much tea for the price (i've got 3 kids & a lot of other priorities; maybe when i retire...). and for the price i'm getting all the health benefits of any other matcha (you get all the antioxidants out of matcha since you ingest the whole leaf; brewing teas often makes the extracted antioxidants bitter) plus i don't feel too guilty using it on my face either. perfectly nice matcha for the beginner & the frugal. gave some to my sister also a novice to matcha & she loved it too. worth a try for the price ",positive
" teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that. this is a moderately price matcha tea so don't except the best flavor. it is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks desserts broth etc. real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste. japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness. matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet. if you don't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice ",positive
" it was great fun! we had talked about the candy when we were all young and that you don't see them any more. so i found it on your site orderd a box and took them to work. it brought back alot of fun memories and we all had a great laugh! thanks ",positive
" i am a fan of tasty bite and think this meal is very good. not my favorite but very good. (i'd give 4.5 stars if possible.) the sauce is flavorful and there are plenty of veggies. and it heats up so easily at work. i love that these meals have no preservatives plenty of fiber no meat and i can recognize all the ingrediants. and you get to eat the whole contents as one serving. i love that ",positive
" recently having moved to the midwest i longed for something different such as the wonderful japanese food that was so readily available on the west coast. i was so happy to come across fugetso-do on amazon! i placed an order on monday evening and by thursday it had arrived! it was still cold tasted very fresh and just delightful. very soft..not rubbery as i have sometimes found in other vendors. completely satisfied my craving. would definitely order from again!!

" i'm a fanatic for gummy candy especially the sour kind. but most sour gummy worms look and taste like a chemistry experiment and most apple and (especially) apricot fruit(ish) rings taste artificial too. haribo does a much better job; their pink grapefuit was my favorite gummy until i discovered these apple ones. they taste natural real healthy apple flavor less stridently sour than grapefruit. now it's a tie for top place: apple and grapefruit. when i can't decide i eat 'em both together. my dentist taught me that trick believe it or not. i sometimes wonder whose side she's on...

" i really love this tea. it is my every morning tea. it has the very green (fresh)taste of the tea served in japan that is distinctive of japanese tea alone. for this reason it is not necessarily for those who prefer the taste of chinese green tea and there is a big difference between the two because its flavor is definitely characteristic of japanese green tea. the color is beautiful - almost as green as the twice as expensive gyokuro variety. i have reordered this tea many times and expect to keep ordering it as long as the price remains close to its present price. ",positive
" i agree with the other reviewer in terms of shipping our basket arrived 2 weeks after ordering also. however i have ordered other baskets from them and it only took a few days to arrive. either way the basket was well worth the wait. it has a large variety of items and they all taste great! if you can order ahead of time you won't go wrong with this basket.

" it is an enjoyment just by opening the cover of the container! a delicate fresh jasmine. a great delicious tea! the tea is arrived in the container seen in the picture with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it. make about 20-40 servings depends on how strong you like it.

" the green tea is excellent. (and it should be considering the cost for such as small amount!) i have to admit i was shocked when i received the tiny little tin...the picture is deceiving. you think you are getting a huge amount. but you only need a small amount. very smooth. overall it is worth it. i highly recommend this tea if you're willing to dish out the cash ",positive
" i know it sounds a little more pricey than the other green teas but this one is smooth and not bitter at all. i put it in soymilk - like the matcha shots you can get at some juice stores. it's refreshing ",positive
" i got this as a recommendation from a friend and i found this to taste really wonderful. it comes in a cute small tin and a small measuring spoon. i enjoy drinking matcha teas in the late afternoon to help me relax and this is the best matcha i have tasted. if you'd like to get wild sometimes i like to sprinkle the matcha powder on top of some vanilla ice cream and it makes a great dessert treat ",positive
" i bought this for me and my wife and the tea is very good. i tasted some green teas but this one is probably one of the best ones ive tasted ",positive

" when i first became obsessed with indian cooking i taught myself from books and did everything by hand including roasting and grinding my own spice blends from whole spices. (if you want to teach yourself indian cooking check out my &quot;so you want to...&quot; guide for helpful cookbooks.) since then i have tried many pre-made spice blends most of them lacking in flavor when compared to what i make myself. and then i found neera's garam masala on the shelf at the market and discovered that this amazing product is as intense lively and flavorful as the garam masala i used to spend hours making. hooray!! i was very happy to find it online at amazon because the markets i shop at do not carry specialty products consistently so i was becoming frustrated when i couldn't find a new jar as my old jar was starting to look empty. double hooray!! this is great stuff and now i never have to be without. : ",positive
" and this little gadget does the job much better than a melitta style funnel and paper filter. if you grind your own you'll need to experiment a bit with how fine to grind and how tight to screw down the tamper but after a few tries you should have the cup of coffee you want. i have 4 now. they are pretty cool for serving coffee when you have company. i don't think the online price is outrageous but if you are lucky enough to live in a city with a vietnamese market you can pick these up for $3 each ",positive

" man when it's the end of the month and there is no food in the fridge i like to cook up a hot pot of ramen noodles. i just boil those noodles and hook it up with canned pork tuna cheese green beans tomatoes lima beans or pig feet. the best way to eat ramen noodles is to pour a lot of hot sauce on top of it. mm! mm! good! a hot bowl of ramen noodles on a cold rainy day at the end of the month makes me feel good inside. it feels you right up. my favorite flavors are beef roasted chicken and scrimp ",positive
" the lovely thing about ramen noodles is that they take three minutes to cook and three minutes to eat and one doesn't usually find themselves wanting to vomit afterwards. they're dirt cheap and their convenience doesn't impede upon the taste which is always a plus. ",positive

" **** tazo's decaffeinated chai black tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. on the paper tea packet tazo writes a rich blend of full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas and exotic aromatic spices. on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of decaffeinated chai as creamy vanilla sweet and pungent spices. tazo describes the aroma as sweet spice. those are pretty accurate. the black tea blend is a little bitter though even with minimal brewing. it's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter. the ingredients in decaffeinated chai are: naturally decaffeinated black teas rooibos cinnamon ginger cardamom chicory cloves black pepper natural flavors and star anise. it is caffeine-free! tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not as good as numi. i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo decaffeinated chai gets only four stars. *** ",positive
" throughout india chai wallahs can be found serving cups of decaffeinated chai to souls who naturally seek inner beauty at a slightly gentler pace. if you like your chai with a peppery kick then this tea will interest you. rooibos cinnamon ginger decaffeinated black tea cardamom ginger chicory cloves star anise and other natural flavors seem to take a back seat to the delicious peppery flavor of this tea. this tea tastes similar to a tea i first tasted in africa where rooibos tea is grown. best served with milk/powdered milk/soy milk or a dash of cream and some honey. since this is a decaffeinated tea it is perfect for late night writing sessions or when you want something calming to drink that doesn't taste like chamomile. ~the rebecca revie ",positive

" we have purchased this ramen at a store that specializes in asian food. there are numerous varieties of ramen so you have to try many of them to find those that you think have the best flavor. we were a bit apprehensive the first time we tried this ramen. however it has since become one of our favorites. the spice is hot but it adds a really good flavor to the noodles. a real winner when you are in the mood for spicy food or on a cold day. because this ramen is very hot we have also mixed a package of this ramen with a package of chicken ramen to lower the chemical heat. even with such a mixture the soup is still fairly hot. when i say hot i mean spicy hot. for many people medium hot is incredibly hot but i can barely discern any spice in medium hot salsa. i am accustomed to eating spicy mexican food and korean food so when i say this soup is hot you have a good reference ",positive
" thai tea is a wonderful exotic drink with deep flavors and vibrant overtones. almost a dessert but can quickly cool your month down after fiery thai entrees. pacificrim-gourmet also offers another brand of thai tea which is less expensive and yields more tea per package and some argue is more authentic. both are very good. ordering the products are easy and delivery was quick and not as expensive as some other on-line vendors ",positive

" if you like it hot then this is for you. warning: only gods can handle this substance. for you lesser beings just add it to recipes :) ",positive
" i love hot sauce. i have been a big fan of other insane hot sauces but the problem with them is that for the most part they cannot be put directly on food instead they need to be diluted before they're okay for consumption. not this hot sauce. it's perfectly hot enough yet not too hot to eat straight out of the bottle. i put it on everything: burger too blah with the normal condiments el yucateco can fix it! shrimp cocktail not kicking el yucateco will show those shrimp who's boss. i even use it to bring salsas up to the proper level of heat. it's definitely hot. if all you're used to is normal red-colored vinegar water this hot sauce will open your eyes and set your mouth on fire. but if you're looking for something with good flavor that'll keep you coming back for more this is the stuff.

" great product and great service. my 2 year old son loves the strawberry and they make a good healthy snack ",positive
" these are the best berries i've ever tasted! i thought for sure they were sweetened but they're not. the berries they used must have been perfectly ripe and the flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them. additionally the slices are whole with very little breakage in the can. the value you get is pretty great considering that 8oz of berries is approximately equivalent to 5# of fresh strawberries. at $3/lb (+ shipping) that's really not bad and you can have these year-round even when strawberries aren't in season ",positive

" i personally love crunchy cheetos but if you look at the nutrition facts they're not really that healthy. i love the crunch and the cheesiness. everything about cheetos are great i even love to lick the cheese off of my fingers. although the fat salt calorie and carbohyrdrate content are extremely terrible the package may say 100% real chese but its 100% real fake cheese. it's like everyone loves chocolate but it's unhealthy. i don't advise you to buy these snacks when you can eat something healthier perhaps a bag of low sodium pretzels or a piece of fruit. i think you should definintely eat cheetos at least once in a while because they taste delicious just not all the time. i don't want to sound like a paranoid health inspector i'm just giving you my personal opinion on this product! i &lt;3 cheetos ",positive
" the cheese flavor is delictible. but don't fall for these wimpy ones. buy the huge puffed cheetos. those are the best. did you know that parents once raised a commotion about chester the cheetah? they thought his cool attitude and love for cheetos would encourage children to eat too many cheetos and become obese. i think this is a valid concern. maybe that is why we do not see too many cheeto commericals anymore. i might add that i find the orange dust to be enjoyable. finger licking good indeed don't be prissy. i also enjoy the orange stains cheetos leave on your fingers after the dust is gone. maybe you can convince your friends you are very artistic and just finger painted a masterpiece using just one shade of orange ",positive
" i love cheetos! did you have any idea you could review cheetos on amazon.com? i admit i had no idea. i typed it as a goof and up the page came. but i stand by my 5 star review. full of yummy msg. do you know how msg works? it dilates your taste buds so all the flavors seem more intense. it actually has no taste of its own. did you know? when my mother was pregnant with me she would wake up in the middle of the night and ask my father to go out and buy cheetos. i don't know why. maybe the salty goodness. if cheetos cost as much as truffles they would be a considered a delicacy and served at the finest restaurants. i wonder if you can buy truffles on amazon.com. shall we check? see you there ",positive

" c. howard company has been around since 1934 when mr. howard formed it in new york city to sell his violet mints. actually due to the quirky way he wrote his signs it has been choward violet mints ever since then! violets are very hard to describe. they have a wonderful perfumed scent that makes you think that they will taste like some sort of chemical but nothing can be further from the truth. these candies have a delicate taste that clears the mouth and freshens the breath. when i was young a local drug store carried a wide range of candies including violets (at least that's what i called them). whenever i could i would go and buy a pack and to this day the taste of violets takes me back to my youth and that drug store with the giant racks of candy. so if you want a candy that tastes like nothing you've ever had before then buy these candies. they are fantastic ",positive

" wonderful service and product! best price for freeze dried strawberries that i've found. there was some powder but i've always noted this with freeze dried strawberries. i didn't think it was excessive and i think it's great added to the graham cracker crust for cheescake ",positive

" after years of nothing but illy pods -- which are very good -- it was nice to branch out and try some other brands. the variety pack is a fun way to do that. i give it 5 stars because it is as advertised. the coffees are good - some are better than others you'll find your favorites - and it is also nice to have a variety of decafs in the house. illy is still a staple though ",positive
" i used to buy pods at starbucks but i started longing for something a little more authentic. luckily my fiancee bought me the podmerchant megasampler as a christmas present. i was overwhelmed! i never knew there were so many different kinds of espresso pods available especially from one store. the selection in this sampler is huge and it includes both caffeinated and decaf pods. (there is also the super sampler but it doesn't include decaf which is nice sometimes in the evening). after trying these pods we found which espressos we liked best and have been buying those but it all started with the mega sampler. the shipping was also very fast. if you're looking to expand your coffee horizons and have an espresso pod machine you'll almost certainly find some new favorites in here ",positive
" this is one of my favorite candy items and one i think is well purchased by anyone with a sweet tooth any gum lover or any one looking for a taste of the orient. three of the flavors in the package: peach mixed fruit and green apple are in a `brick' form. they are about 1 in x  in and are very soft and easy to chew. the remaining four flavors: orange strawberry grape and melon all come in small boxes that contain four gumballs each. each flavor is powerful without being overpowering. they have a smooth almost creamy texture when chewed and blow nice big bubbles. also they're not overly sweet or grainy with sugar. my teeth are often sensitive if gum is too sugary yet these offer no obstacles only mouth appeal. i highly recommend this gum! ",positive
" i purchased this for an oktoberfest party there was a lot left over mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk. the sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way. i'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity. there are several little flats of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough ",positive
" i ordered these last christmas to wrap up and give to my parents as a gift. the box i received was fresh and in good condition. the marzipan themselves were delicious and there were enough for the whole family to share. i think these little gems will become a regular addition to our holiday celebration.

" i make thai curries occasionally and the mortar and pestle i was using was tiny. i would have to grind up all the spices in batches to avoid them from spilling out. i finally broke down and looked for a larger set and found this one. i debated between the 2 and 3 cup version because i didn't have a good feel for how big they really were. i ended up getting the 2 cup version and i love it. it is very large - plenty big enough for making a good size curry paste. its also very heavy because as advertised is made of a solid chunk of granite. it also looks great attractive enough to leave out on the counter and people constantly comment on it when visiting. mine doesn't look quite like the picture on amazon. the outside of the bowl (mortar) and the top half of the pestle appear to be polished in the picture which is not the case for the one i received. very heavy and solid - a great purchase.

" if you like smashing things this does the job nicely. i smiled taking it out of the box. it is quite heavy and large. very nice open bowl with large capacity. i highly recommend this as a workhorse. warning: you may need a second smaller mortar if you pour/dump from your mortar often as this is very heavy. but this is very handy for working with larger items or quantities ",positive
" received as a gift from my wife (i'm the cook) and it makes quick work of herbs fresh berries for yogurt or anything you need to smash ",positive

" that is my husbands' view; he's the one who eats habanero peppers like they're radishes!!- he love's this sauce; he adds it to his own salsa blends to make them hot enough to melt your tonsils... he has quite a following for his home-made sauces. when he can't get fresh habeneros he uses dave's to turn up the heat ",positive
" having experimented with several hot sauces over several years including pyro diablo and snakebite habanero extract i can confidently say that this is the tastiest and hottest sauce i have ever used. my only regret is that it is that it is nearly impossible to apply in small enough quantities leaving my eyes bleeding after every use. perfect ",positive
" ok folks this is not a joke. i am a real fan of hot sauce hot peppers and anything that makes my eyes water and i have to honestly say that dave's insanity sauce is absolutely the hottest thing i've ever tasted. i use one drop in about 25 ounces of home-made tomato sauce and it makes the sauce noticibly hot. this is not a sauce to dash into your soup or to liven up some salsa. don't use it like tabasco!!! it is a heavy-duty hot sauce that should be used as in ingredient when cooking a decent amount of a dish. my brother doubted its powers so i poked the end of a toothpick into the sauce and gave it to him. the poor guy freaked and ate more italian bread than i've ever seen anyone eat in my life. this bottle will last you a long time. why doesn't it get 5 stars? it's just too hot ",positive

" this candy is awesome... read my review i posted on the 5lb bag page. and while you are at it... buy the 5# bag ... they are way cheaper. this 12 pack ends up being only 3.75 lbs and costs $12.50 and the 5lb bag is only $13.00 as of this review. ",positive
" this kit is so cool! it's not like bobas that you get in restaurants but it's so cool how it all comes together. they give you everything you need and the instructions are clear. the different flavors are really cool too. my fiance and i love making the drinks it makes us feel special : ",positive

" this is very good roasted seaweed. excellent in fact. most companies just dry their seaweed but let me tell you they are lazy and really don't know seaweed. see that's the problem with most of the world today laziness! i can remember a time when companies and people cared about going the extra mile when quality still mattered. it's a shame. everyone is all about speed and convenience speed and convenience. it's like we're all on treadmills or really fast escalators or something quick and automated like that. i just don't know what is wrong with everyone. sometimes i just have to sit down and shake my head. roasting makes the seaweed almost taste like chicken and when you use it in your favourite recipes you will think you've died and gone to heaven. yamamotoyama is the best!

" honestly as a family who is gluten free corn free soy free dairy free i've tried everything on the market atleast once. this brand of pasta is the #1 choice in our household and the number one choice of families i know who have kids who can't eat wheat. unlike corn pastas and most brown rice pastas this one never gets mushy. skip the trials we went thru just buy this one.

" celestial seasonings has done all of us who experience fitful sleeping a great service by this offering. this tea is gentle soothing and an all natural way to end your day. i especially enjoy a cup of this tea sitting in front of the fireplace wrapped in a warm blanket and reading a good book. there is something about this tea that is comforting to the soul. a nice warm cup is enough to help you feel comfortable in your own skin and settle down to a restful slumber. highly recommended ",positive
" valerian and chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves lemon grass hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. this tea is much more effective than regular sleepytime and i can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. you may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. this could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. unlike sleeping pills you won't feel groggy the next morning. blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" we learned about agave nectar in san francisco at tres agaves a mexican restaurant that makes the best margaritas we have ever had. they use 100% reposado blue agave tequila with lime juice and with agave nectar to take the bite off. when we got our bottle we made margaritas that were also amazing and then began using it whenever we would normally use honey. i especially like it for slightly sweetening a home made vinagerette. wonderful stuff ",positive

" this was my dad's absolute favorite candy. he loved orange and bittersweet chocolate best of any flavors and this was for him a match made in heaven. i adore it as well. after my dad passed away i found a stash of them in his cupboard. they aren't easy to find but they make a most welcome after-dinner sweet with coffee for guests. ",positive
" the product description calls the orangettes belgian vitamin c. except for the luxury price i'm sure belgians must be pretty healthy with these around. they're amazing! the combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular but leonidas does it very well. the dark chocolate is very rich not bitter and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet). unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion. the result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying. i don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health but they will definitely improve your day. in my opinion they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try. the packaging is a gold box wrapped in blue and white leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box. for shipping the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell. mine arrived within three days and looked like i'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift ",positive
" i am not really a big candy person but i received these white chocolates for christmas and let's just say i have a new found love of white chocolate. i have never had something so wonderful. it is truely a heavenly chocolate experience. if you haven't tried them you must if you have then welcome to the world of fine chocolates. amen!!

" my diet requires that i eat less sugar so i'm constantly trying sugar free products. i've always loved the jelly belly brand and the sugar free beans are a great alternative. my favorite flavor by far is buttered popcorn and it tastes almost exactly the same as the orginal. the only thing is the outer shell is a bit harder than the traditional bean but for someone who is picky it wasn't enough to bother me. it is lower in calories but watch what you eat because it still has carbohydrates just like anything else. i would recommend this product to anyone ",positive
" the sugar-free was very good. i've had the regular but these are really good too especially if you are a diabetic or just want to avoid sugar. quite a few flavors ",positive
" this instant thai tea did not taste like the thai tea i've had restaurants but it was pretty good. i liked it hot rather than cold. it's pretty sweet. i decided to add a very small amount of cinnamon to it and it came out great. a bit high on calories-180 calories per packet. i would buy it again ",positive

" authentic taste long shelf life in your fridge easy to use and the price is right. how can you go wrong. when i prepare a curry with this i don't go crazy with a lot of thai ingredients other than the curry paste. just some veggies from the super like bell pepper scallions carrots jalapeno and serrano chilies and some sliced pork or chicken or beef. so easy and so delicious ",positive
" my cousin-in-law is thai and she cooked an amazing curry for us. i had to have the recipe and she said it was really very simple. just get the green mae ploy curry paste some asian basil and some coconut milk. a little salt sugar chicken some bamboo shoots and rice were the only other things i would need to make it. well i couldn't believe it was really that simple but it was! the paste imparts several subtle and delicious flavors to the curry. tastes like you slaved for hours. i never have leftovers when i make this curry. the paste is so low priced i plan to stock up so i'll always have some on hand. plus-- no preservatives no wierd ingredients. it's all food stuffs albiet some of the ingredients i don't recognize... what is a galangal? whatever it all is sure tastes good ",positive
" i'd don't know exactly how to write an in-depth review of anything let alone a candybar so i'll just describe what i think of it. in my opinion the dark chocolate toblerone candy bar is my favore candy bar for simple reasons: 1. dark chocolate is my favorite kind of chocolate 2. the honey that's added adds a subtle smoothness 3. the almond pieces aren't very big so the bar is mostly chocolate 4. swiss chocolate is the best chocolate i've eveer had 5. there's no denying the packaging is really neat what can i say it's a candy bar ",positive
" product arrived quickly and was priced much lower than i have ever paid for it in minesota or illinois. packaging was excellent. i will do business with this company again. ",positive
" i ordered the gourmet sampler and am very pleased with both the freshness and taste! (my box had 3 ice packs to keep the bakery chilled plus plenty of foam peanuts so there was no breakage or crushing.) i had first tried a muffin from a local retailer but wanted an idea of other chatila products. granted when anything is sugar-free it doesn't taste just like the original. but the items i recieved were close enough that i don't feel like i'm missing out on anything. i follow a diet for medical reasons that is low in sugar and high in protein. these products balance both nutritionally without sacrificing taste. my first bite of the chocolate donut (the first donu i've had in 20 months) was great. i can enjoy treats now that i thought i'd never be able to eat again ",positive
" fox's chocolate syrup is by far the best chocolate syrup i have ever used. i saw it in the local grocery store here in pittsburgh pa and tried it. after using it for about six months the local store here stopped selling it. i briefly tried the other brands and there's no way i can even go back to them after using fox's ",positive
" if you're from brooklyn there's really only one chocolate syrup for your milk or egg creams. fox's is the cult favorite dating way back maybe even before trolley cars and the original trolley dodgers! no bona fide brooklynite or ex-patriate such as myself would ever consider a substitute. hershey be da----!this is the real deal; accept no substitutes. my only regret is the shipping cost from this purveyor. it's cheaper to get on a train and visit the nearest nyc gristede's; and you get a day in manhattan to boot! 5 stars plus for this wonderful unbeatable product. zero stars for the not to be believed cost to get it home. demand it of your local super market manager.

" not only are the truffles excellent but the package arrived in record speed with standard shipping chosen. we are very pleased with our truffles and with our experience with this company. we will be ordering from them again ",positive
" finally - a company that cares about it's reputation and products! i ordered these truffles and recieved them securely packaged and protected to ensure they arrived safely and as quickly as possible. i am even planning a special dinner with friends entirely based around the truffles i ordered as i was so please with them. i also saw the other products this company carries - the attention to detail and the information provided on each and every product is outstanding - just like their quality (i.e.: saffron). i have found my gourmet source from now on!

" if every seller was like jr mushrooms the world would be a much better place. they wont stop until there customer is completly satisfied. i ordered some winter black truffles from them and got my package lightning fast but came to find out that it wasnt what i ordered. i called jr and they said they sent better quality black truffles that cost more for the same price and this story doesnt end they even sent a jar of the original truffles i ordered just so i can taste the diffrence for free!!!!!!!!! name another seller that would do that ",positive

" my dad recently found out he was diabetic (and go figure we are from milwaukee wi too)...and he loves chocolate. this was my first of three birthday gifts for him. it came in a fabulous tin and he said the entire house smelled of pure belgian chocolate the minute he opened the tin. it tasted absolutely wonderful. and for $20...this is not a deal this is a steal. sugar-free does not mean calorie or carb free but he can still eat slices in moderation. he was very very excited about this present. and i was very glad to make his day! wisconsin cheeseman shipped in like 2 days. i know all good cheese comes from wisconsin but now i know quality bakery too! thank you! highly recommended! he can't keep his hands off of it. heh ",positive

" these are another neat taste experience from japan. the chocobabies however contain shellac as an ingredient which kinda turned me off to them when i learned about it. the stars in this set are the strawberry-chocolate cone things whatever they're called. they're delicious! also the coffee flavored ones are excellent. i'm finding i am a fan of just about anything made by meiji and this set is no exception ",positive
" i bought both the 50 flavor gift box and the bean blast basket for corporate christmas gifts. the basket was much more expensive and didn't have nearly the wow value of this 50 flavor gift box. it's shaped like a monopoly game box and has the substantial feel of a real gift. it's also reasonably priced at around $15. of course the jelly beans are top notch and the unique flavors speak for themselves. this is an excellent gift item or treat for yourself ",positive
" jelly bellies are the gourmet version of the jelly bean. they are unique because of the variety of flavors and the ease with which you can recognize flavors. even better there are combinations of jelly bellies that can yield even more flavors. jelly bellies are small but they are packed with a great flavor. jelly bellies are a special treat and while there are not an every day snack i love to indulge upon occasion. they are worth every penny each time i splurge to get them. enjoy! ",positive
" i'm a huge fan of jelly belly jelly beans so i really enjoyed this gift box of 50 different kinds! my favorite is definitely tangerine - but it's always a treat to try new and different flavors. this box comes with a guide that tells you which flavors are which so you can avoid the ones you dislike (for me - peanut butter jelly beans.. gag!). it's pretty good size with a decent amount of jelly beans for the price - jelly bellies have never been cheap! it's well worth the cost though and a great gift this year for christmas ",positive
" ramune is the japanese version lemonade and it is a really nice drink if you can get the glass ball to move away from the opening without spraying yourself with your drink. if you have been sprayed once too often but love the taste perhaps you should try this candy. i am pretty addicted to the stuff and eat them 3 or 4 at a time. i enjoy just letting them sit in my mouth with that fizzy taste. they really taste quite a lot like ramune should. sucking on some ramune candy is nice way to pass time reading actually. they are quite refreshing. these candies are not hard and quite chewable for those who prefer that. for anyone looking for a candy that is not over-the-top sweet give ramune soda candy a shot. it is a nice candy and makes a great snack. even the container looks like a ramune bottle ",positive
" this stuff tastes just like sweettarts. i recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on it ",positive
" this is a great linguisa! i usually buy mine from a store a few towns away because they have 'hot' chorizo sausage but these have a really great flavor even though they are not 'hot'. and they are organic. the fat content is minimal when microwaving for a fast high protein snack yet it's high enough to use only the meat to coat the pan when adding it to scrambled eggs. and the price is good too. free shipping and handling with a nominal purchase makes this a really good buy. i highly recommend it ",positive
" this is the story of two tazo teas. i found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. i tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. tazo lotus and tazo wild sweet orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. the way i make this tea is by steeping two lotus and two wild sweet orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. then you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea. drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. lotus decaffeinated green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. wild sweet orange is a blend of lemongrass blackberry leaves citric acid rose hips spearmint leaves natural flavors orange peel safflowers hibiscus flowers rose petals natural orange essence ginger root and licorice root. i love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. the boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful. a romantic tea with a golden-orange color. i can never decide if i like this best hot or cold so i end up drinking it hot and cold. half on ice and half in a mug. when this tea is hot it is much more romantic and aromatic. when chilled it takes on a more bitter component. for something even more exotic try the tazo green ginger tea. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" **** tazo's lotus decaffeinated green tea is one of my favorite tazo teas. the lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful. this tea is not bitter or harsh in any way. it is one of the most natural-tasting of the tazo's i've tasted very subtle and much less artificial-tasting. the ingredients in lotus are: naturally decaffeinated green tea natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. of course this tea is caffeine-free. tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea. tazo is owned by starbucks. their web site is fun and quirky with a zen-type focus definitely worth checking out. it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. on the paper tea packet tazo writes delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower. on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of lotus as peach nutty flowery overripe melon. this surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied with an aroma reminiscent of freesia. tazo also describes the aroma as tropical fruit green tea. hmmm...i don't taste all of these various flavors and i suspect that tazo really pushes the creative writing limit. i taste green tea and a nice flowery flavor which i'm assuming is the lotus but not the rest---the peach nuts melon freesia tropical fruit---they're missing from what i can discern here. i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good---better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings---but not as good as numi. i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo lotus gets only four stars. *** ",positive
" i've seen that they are referred to as licorice with a cream filling. they kinda have that texture but not at all that flavor. much more like a fruit roll up with a sugary cream inside. i like them ",positive
" i agree w/ everything anon y. mouse said about this candy! soo good. so different. it tastes european in that it doesn't overload you with sugar. they are almost delicate and creamy while being slightly (slightly) fruit flavored! it is a nice change from american candy. i found these at a local coffee shop and will definitely be purchasing them again! i think i have overlooked haribo for some reason but this product is really good. haribo is based from germany but sold in the us too.. pico balla is a unique candy and they are small so you don't have to commit to eating a king sized piece of candy :) try these they are very interesting ",positive
" pico-balla is a very subtle candy--and you will find yourself eating a large amount of it if you don't pay too much attention. the different colors are each differently flavored and you can eat this chewy treat slowly or quickly. i like to bite off the outer layer first and then eat the inside but my wife eats the inside part first. just a very different candy from what we are used to--it doesn't taste overly sugary won't feel like you are greasing your mouth with fructose etc...give it a try. i wish i had bought two boxes. i wish amazon offered the balla-balla too. i can't wait to try that sometime but i would rather wait until i can get it at a good price. amazon's price is about 66% of the world market price and even less what online candy stores sell it for. take a chance on it. ",positive
" i got a back of pico balla in germany a couple of years ago and keep coming back to it! good stuff. haribo is the gold-standard for gummi candy and this particular type is really good ",positive

" i first picked this tea up in paris at the bon marche department store food halls (le grand epicerie de paris). on returning to the states and trying the tea i was most impressed. redolent of bergamot and flowers it has an intense aroma and flavor that is well-enhanced with the addition of honey and a little milk. it is now my favorite tea. enjoy ",positive
" the cocoa is of superior quality as is all dean & deluca products. ",positive
" besides being a very good deal for the price this item thankfully does not contain lavender which is not commonly used in french cuisine but is used rather to freshen clothes chests. however the classic mix of herbes de provence for cooking usually contains one additional herb: marjoram ",positive

" i had been hearing about steel-cut oatmeal and the benefits of eating it for quite sometime now. this is my first time ever trying this and i must say that i am extremely impressed. now i haven't tried any other brands but i definitely would recommend this brand. i received my order rather quickly (within a week). the amount of oats i received for the price is amazing. the 70oz can is huge. the great thing about this product you don't have to use a lot it at one to produce a sizeable meal. i believe the suggested serving size is 1/4 of a cup uncooked. it may not look like a lot initially before cooking but after it cooks it swells considerably. oh yeah get this... i am a type 2 diabetics and usually foods like foods such as rice oatmeal and pasta cause my blood sugars to spike. thereafter i feel sluggish until my insulin kicks in to regulate my sugar levels (maybe i am telling too much of my personal business..lol). not with this. i don't know what it is (maybe it's in my mind) but my body seem to process this differently. try it ",positive
" the product arrived on time and as advertised. the oats were nearly as good as mccanns and quite a bit less expensive. you just have to be careful not to overcook them as they get a little mushy if overdone ",positive
" tastes like oatmeal only chunkier. i like mine breads and cereals crunchier so this was right up my alley. takes about 25 minutes to cook but overall i like it ",positive
" i got my order quickly despite the holiday rush. these oats are great i'd use a bigger word to describe how awesome these oats are but i cant remember one. the texture is chewy and it induces prolonged satiety because youre forced to eat slow and savor the full oat flavor. depending on your recipe and how much you eat you should be satisfied for a long time after eating a bowl for breakfast. i wonder how the freshness will hold up after theyre opened though because unlike mc canns - this can uses a plastic lid with an oxygen absorption packet. we'll see. the price has come down so these oats are an even better buy. buy up. how are these oats compared to mc canns ",positive
" this is the best oatmeal i've ever eaten. we cook it overnight in a small crockpot. a quick hot breakfast the next morning! you can add things to it for endless variations ",positive
" i thought this salt tasted pretty good until it occurred to me i go to the bathroom everytime i take a swim ",positive

" i had a difficult time finding the sanding sugar. there are no stores in my area that carry it. i was very surprised to find it on amazon. the store i bought it from was quick to deliver and i was very pleased with the price of the product. i received a generous amount and was able to dust all my sugar cookies! thank you ",positive
" the product was as described. i just didn't realize that i was ordering from an exclusive chocolate store in new york city! the candies were $2.50 and the shipping was four times that much! (i had it mailed to a u.s. address not my address in brazilin case you're wondering. ",positive

" i've been a fan of dave's sauces for quite awhile now and this product is no exception. the initial bite into one of these olives is relatively painless. and then the fun begins. a slow burning sensation begins to take over until your mouth is wondering what did i just do?. want some more fun? offer some to friends and then stand back to watch the excitement. while not as heat intensive as his insanity sauces ranking only half-way up his thermometer scale it's still got a little bit of punch to it with it's five different peppers. who would've though olives could be this much fun ",positive

" we visited the south of france during the summer. spent time with our friends who live there. they made us the most delicious dinner one evening. using these bricks...they rolled a ball of mozzarella in thyme and then rolled a thin slice of prosciutto around the mozzarella ball/thyme. then rolled it up in a brick and baked them for about 15 minutes. i was obsessed with finding these bricks. i went to gourmet store after gourmet store here to no avail. finally on amazon i found them! whew. i didn't want to have to travel all the way back to france to get them!

" hi there! my name is frank and zaggy has allowed me to write and post a product review on his about me area as a christmas present. i don't care what everybody else says about zaggy he's a decent guy! today i'm going to review one of my favorite treats: kraft jet-puffed marshmallows! boy do these take me back to those misspent days of my foolish youth. i remember those wonderful times when i'd grab a couple bags of these and play a round or two of fat rabbit with a few of my visiting cousins. now what is fat rabbit (chubby bunny in some locales) you say? it's a campfire game where you and at least one opponent take turns popping marshmallows into your mouth one at a time (no chewing or swallowing allowed) trying to say the words fat rabbit after each new marshmallow tossed into your gub. the guy who is still able to pronounce fat rabbit with the most marshmallows stuffed in his/her cheeks is the winner. i usually beat out my less-than-capable opponents back in the day but my victories came at a high price: my cheeks got stretched out so much my jowls are now floppier than the ones my grandpa had when he passed away in the convalescent home a few years back. i probably shouldn't have challenged him to that game of fat rabbit during that last visit... bye ",positive

" out of all of the new flavors of hershey kisses hitting the shelves these days the cherry cordial flavor is by far the best! my daughter and i both agree. what a pleasant surprise to find them on amazon! we were able to buy them in the store from before christmas until valentine's day and then they just disappeared. how sad but glad to see they can be bought online ",positive
" the taste of these cherry flavored hershey kisses is very very good. my kids also commented on how tasty they were and ate them first out of their christmas stocking candy. i will definitely buy them again ",positive
" i bought these for my dad at christmas and he just loves the taste. you can't go wrong with a kiss. ",positive
" i'm really picky when it comes to chocolate covered cherries - i don't care too much for the dime store variety - so i wasn't sure what to expect when my mother handed me a hershey cherry cordial kiss to try. but from the first bite i was hooked! they taste exactly like the expensive brands i've come to love - and at a fraction of the price! if you like chocolate covered cherries you just can't go wrong with this product! these kisses are unbelievably good!! ",positive
" this product is amazing. not only did i get a very good tasting product but i also got a hand written note and a free sample of candy made fresh by das foods. i also purchased the lava salt with the same reaction. i would recomend this product to anyone who is looking for one of those different seasonings for their food ",positive
" this product was an excellent price for a quality product. shipping was much quicker than expected and came with a hand-written note on the envoice. the holiday shipping did not deter this company from providing first-class service. it would be a pleasure to order from them again ",positive
" the red sea salt has a earthy flavor; it is slower to dissolve on the tongue. it is a beautiful unexpected hue and surprised and delighted my dinner guests--none had ever tasted it before! i used a light sprinkling on my endive salad (along with pepper) and it looked exotic and tasted amazing!

" so here's the deal i'm from omaha you can't go two miles without an omaha steaks store. here we just call em steaks. i can go to any butcher shop in omaha and buy steaks that are just as good if not better than anything omaha steaks has to offer for considerably less. this has always been my stance. that is until i had these these are quite simply the best steaks. yes they're expensive but if you're like my family and go out for steaks on birthday's you can actually save quite a bit by buying these instead. you won't get a better steak in a restaurant and my uncle's the head chef in a steak house i could be stabbed just for saying that. cooked rare to medium rare you can literally cut them with your fork they are more tender and have twice the flavor of any filet i've ever had. i can't stress to you how good these are. it's still the only steak i buy from omaha steaks but when you come from the land of steaks that's saying a lot. sorry texas you may have more cows but nebraska beef is simply better ",positive
" in the midwest some folks think of this as biscotti but don't be confused. it is correctly named. it is a toast cookie so when you dunk it be quick about it! my husbands favorite and quite tasty i like the small almond bits and that i can chew it without dunking (not at hard as their biscotti-see my review) ",positive
" in my experiences with indian cuisine from patronizing local restaurants owned and operated by native indian folks this is quite comparable and the flavors are very similar. it's nice to be able to open a package of indian food to eat with some basmati rice quickly. recommended. some of the flavors are spicy.

" this is a delicious basic thai yellow curry with some vegetables. it comes with a little pouch of cooked rice to soak up the sauce and balance the meal but i still found that with this meal i really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes nuts or eggplant. i don't have any thai places in my area so i add some chicken and pine nuts to round it out and it really helps that thai craving. the sauce is delicious and the veggies are crisp ",positive
" after growing up in africa one becomes rather fond of rooibos tea and i never thought the day would arrive when i would recommend anything but a pure rooibos tea. tazo has taken rooibos tea to a new level by blending african rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus lemon myrtle lemon verbena orange peel rosemary and lemon balm. rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an african veld fire. i remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. now i mix in powdered milk and honey. honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend. for some reason this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel. i've recently rediscovered the health benefits of rooibos although i can truly say i've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. rooibos is naturally sweet very aromatic and is high in magnesium calcium iron and copper. mothers in africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic. an application of cold rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies indigestion insomnia and nervous tension. this is one of the tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. if you enjoy this tea you might also want to try tazo honeybush tea. the tazo company really has my attention with their packaging amusing tales of ancient tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection. ~therebeccareview.com ",positive
" passion fruit concentrate has become my favorite secret ingredient...i use it to make a citrus sauce for halibut steaks (water sugar cracked black peppercorns honey lemon and orange juice and zest and passion fruit concentrate)--serve the fish on a bed of arugula pour the sauce over garnish with julienne strips of cucumber and slivered almonds serve alongside jasmine rice and your guests will feel they've landed in hawaii...i also add it to italian cream cake replacing a couple of tablespoons of liquid ingredients with concentrate and add it to the buttercream frosting as well in place of milk. i've used this approach to make everything from a three-layer cake decorated with orchids to bite-size mini-cupcakes dusted with orange sugar. my husband puts it in martinis with pineapple and i mix it with hypnotiq for a gorgeous aqua cocktail. everyone always wants to know what that exotic flavor is but i only reveal the secret to my best friends..

" i was making a wedding cake and the bride wanted passion fruit mousse between the layers.i said no problem. then i tried to locate passion fruit puree in my area(sacramento).couldn't find it. thank goodness for the perfect puree of napa valley. the passion fruit puree came frozen thawed beautifulyand tasted fantastic.what a great product ",positive
" this is a superb product that used to be found on most grocery store shelves. sadly they disappeared from the shelves. after an extensive internet search for the product i was able to find them through amazon.com and gristede's supermarket. i ordered a case and they arrived in perfect shape and just as advertised. when these are gone i will certainly use this same procedure to order more ",positive
" my first and last beverage review. i am gob smacked by this coffee. what's that complex flavor? i don't know but i've never had better and i've tried a lot of brands gourmet and not so. smooth nutty winey woodsy whatever who cares i love it. maybe it's all that caffeine racing through my veins (i'm on my third cup) but i'm about ready to dance and break into song. a polka would be nice. plus the fact that it's dedicated to a cat is extremely sweet. and they practice social and environmental responsibility with their growers. way to go seattle.

" i have been faithfully buying omaha steaks products for years. in my grocer's freezer and my butcher there is nothing the compares to the taste and quality of these burgers. you get what you pay for -- this company delivers consistent quality again and again. i think other reviewers of omaha steaks product don't know how to use their grill. if you follow the step-by-step instructions: presto -- perfect taste every time ",positive

" the vanilla beans arrived still moist and plump. they're so much better in appearance than the kinds you can buy at whole foods or wild oats which are very dry and shriveled by comparison not to mention overpriced. the fragrance is overpowering and the shipment comes with a nice recipe for creme brulee. don't throw away your used vanilla pods! save them to flavor your sugar ",positive
" first of all: wow. instant noodles for sale on amazon? second excellent decision on selling nongshim's shin ramen. nongshim is the market leader in korean instant noodles which are epitomized by shin ramen's trademark spicyness and deliciosity. not as filling as the non-cup version (which you have to cook over a stove) this small guy does pack a punch and will keep you satisfied - for three hours until you get hungry for more. shin ramen is second only to sutah ramen in my opinion ",positive
" man i've lived all over the world and while most think that ramen is a poor college student's meal is missing out. after a few months of life in korea i couldn't get enough of the stuff. i'm glad to see that it is finally being offered by amazon. i now can get a good book and some tasty spicy ramen. life is good ",positive
" much better than some of the other coffee gift baskets! i ordered a gift basket last year for my mom for christmas that ended up being basically 2 cups worth of coffee and a few mugs - not worth the cost! this basket contains a little more coffee as well as some cocoa and cookies. ideally i'd prefer to buy a basket that included a lot more actual coffee - but this one is way better than most i have ordered in the past! it also comes in a very nice basket - which is great to re-use for making your own gift baskets or for attractive storage ",positive
" the original is my favorite but my wife hates it. she likes the green tea chai latte which i don't care for. unfortunately reviews will be of little help since taste varies but the product is recommended ",positive
" i hate to use this word but this product truly is orgasmic. it comes out perfect cup after cup having a creamy yet zingy taste. the first time i tried it was at einstein bros. bagels (the use the concentrate themselves to create &quot;their&quot; chai tea latte). when i first tried this i exclaimed to myself &quot;wow!!!!&quot;. any person i have ever served this to was willing to vouch that their tastebuds were in sheer ecstasy. mr. oregon chai tea latte concentrate thank you ",positive
" this sauce is medium heat for everyday use. it has an excellent roasted pepper flavor and there is *no vinegar* to get in the way. consequently you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it. an every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue. this is not a boutique novelty it's a household staple. the 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household. you want good? try tapatio on cottage cheese. you'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again i promise. i use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream but my personal favorite applications of tapatio are: eggs potatoes pizza anything creole (forget tabasco!) cottage cheese most rice mac cheese and of course...mex in my opinion this is the best sauce in your local grocery store ",positive
" i received the fresh roast plus 8 as a 30th birthday present from my parents which has allowed me to take my coffee snobbery to an entirely new level! this model has worked admirably in the 2+ months i've had it roasting one batch at least every two days. it's not automatic (there isn't a good roaster that is) and you need to carefuly monitor color aroma and cracks to achieve a consistent roast but the coffee it produces is balanced consistent and far and away better than anything you can buy in the store. the negatives are that it does feel a mite flimsy: the glass roasting chamber sits precariously on the fan unit and could easily be knocked off and broken. also it only roasts a few ounces at a time -- perfect if you just want to roast enough for your morning cup but don't expect to be able to roast half or entire pounds of coffee for gifts. the smoke is pervasive so it's helpful to roast the beans under your stovetop exhaust fan lest you set off the smoke alarm. overall this is an excellent product for the home roaster who's just getting into the world of coffee roasting. should the interest take hold a little more it would be wise to upgrade to a larger capacity table-top drum roaster or a used commercial machine ",positive
" i saw the price of this and went what?? then i looked at the same recipe that i had downloaded from food network. these became a bargain. a pound plus of chocolate and a pound of good butter cost a lot more than this package and this gives the promise of almost-instant gratification without having to wash 10 dishes. i mixed; i licked the spoon and bowl; i baked and went crazy just smelling them; i waited for them to cool; i picked off crumbs and bits that increased in size. i cut off a small portion and gobbled it; i cut off a larger portion and ate it with ice cream; i went to the local bakery and bought dessert for my guests; i hid the brownies (never you mind where--the car trunk is a great spot); i went out and bought two more boxes. try them. they really are the best brownies i have ever had and i have to admit to consuming a fair share of brownies in the last 40 years. you will buy a second box i promise. don't think of it as buying a brownie mix think heaven in a blue box ",positive

" i've used this to produce batch after batch of great sprouts with no issues. the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is that the instructions are confusing and contradictory ",positive
" the easy sprouter is a great vertical sprouter. the seeds or beans go into an inner cup with drainage holes. the inner cup sets in the outer cup which catches any dripping water and still allows air circulation around the inner cup on all sides. maintaining your growing sprouts (for most seed types) means holding the inner cup under running water for at least thirty seconds allowing excess water to drain off and setting the inner cup back in the outer cup. doing this two or three times a day makes sure that the growing sprouts remain fresh enough to avoid spoiling moist enough not to dry out but never remaining in standing water. most seeds need to be pre-soaked initially and this step can be managed directly in the easy sprouter. there are three lids: two lock into place - one with air holes one without. the third is domed but doesn't actually lock onto the cup. by comparison sprouting in canning jars requires the jar to be filled and emptied several times with each rinsing and draining sufficiently is not always easy. the sprout master which is another sprouting tray i love allows similar rinsing but the seeds must be soaked in a different container and then transfered to the sprout master. the sprout master allows the growing plants slightly more light because it has width rather than height but the difference is slight. i've mostly used my easy sprouter for leafy sprout salad mixes (alfalfa clover etc...) these varieties take about a week to grow. with the variety of lids the sprouter it is very flexible. i haven't tried to sprout while traveling but i'm confident that it would work well. it works for storing your grown sprouts in the fridge as advertised but i usually take them out of the sprouter and break up the clumps before serving and put any left-overs into a different container. i use my easy sprouter nearly constantly along with my sprout master mini trays. i currently have a second easy sprouter on order ",positive
" the matcha tea is exactly what i expected. extremely green great flavor. keep in mind i'm in no way a matcha expert but from my limited experience with this type of tea (starbucks etc.) it was great. got the product within days of ordering it far before the estimated date of delivery. highly recommend this seller ",positive
" bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes...this is a reasonably-priced nice-sized sample to use. $5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1-oz. packet of powder but luckily i had a gift certificate. i look forward to trying different recipes with this. cheesecake tastes good a lot earthier/more organic now that we have the real matcha. i think i'll try making iced lattes now. too bad it didn't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in...that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too ",positive
" i use this powder to make the jamba juice equivalent of the matcha green tea blast. it does a great job in reproducing the taste. i'd recommend this supplier ",positive

" i am gluten intolerent or what ever you want to call it. i get asthma from wheat flour so i've spent the last 8 years searching for the perfect flour. i've been using this for years now i love this stuff. i use it for cookies cakes crepes pancakes waffles* madalines yorkshire pudding flouring meats for crispy frying thickening soups and sauces etc etc. the only thing that it hasn't worked for is bisquits. i think because this flour needs a binding agent such as eggs or xantham gum. with just the butter the dough after baking falls apart. flakey and yummy but a total mess! it also tastes kind of bitter raw but once it's baked or cooked it's exactly the same flavor and texture as wheat flour. you can't go wrong with this alternative. go forth confidently and experiment with all your favorite recipes using this wonderful flour! i love trying martha stewart's cookie recipes this flour works perfectly for all i've tried. *some recipes may require a little extra leavening agent (baking soda or baking powder) such as waffles madalines and pancakes.

" when i first tasted this herbal infusion it seemed i had tasted this flavor before when i lived in africa. it is much more delicate than a rooibos tea and has a golden rose color. when blended with a clover honey it almost has a hint of lemon. the honeybush is a plant that only grows in the high mountains of the western and eastern cape regions of south africa. i might have first tasted this tea when we visited cape town and went to table mountain. the plant is harvested during the flowering season. honeybush is naturally sweet caffeine free and has very little tannin. i still enjoy adding honey to this tea to enhance the natural honey flavor. this mineral rich infusion is rather soothing and can help to calm the nervous system. this is technically a wild mountain tea with a hint of aromatic flowers. i only wish i was drinking this tea while visiting table mountain. it gets rather chilly up there when you are overlooking the atlantic ocean. ~the rebecca revie ",positive

" i originally bought this small container of fleur de sel for a fish recipe i found that said it was de rigeur however i thought it was like any other salt simply grainier. of course i only added a little bit of salt after i had grilled my fish and did not think it would add much to the dish. can you imagine my surprise when i tasted the fish only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth. i must say that i'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore. now i understand why the great chefs of the past and present consider this the queen of all salts..

" i bought seven beans for seven dollars and was a bit unimpressed with the aromatic quality. they didn't have that strong complex aroma right out of the bag that bourbon beans are known for. that is not to say that the inside of the bean isn't aromatic. after all it's the guts that really count. even though these beans don't seem to be as aromatic as other beans this is still a killer deal!!! i recently purchased one bean from a popular brand spice islands for seven dollars. an unbelievably aromatic bean but seven times the cost of these beans!?!?!? i think i'll just buy these and use twice as many as the higher quality beans. i'm still making away like a bandit ",positive
" first order arrived damaged by the u.s. post office. order was promptly replaced at no charge. fast shipping to san francisco delicious plump fragrant beans. excellent product. excellent customer service. ",positive

(not long) i also use one when i make my hot chocolate syrup (lots of bittersweet chips melted in milk and a little haff and half and the bean scraped and the pod - once again left in - i mske hot chocolate out of it by adding more milk to taste and a little bitty bit of brandy...decadent...oh my yes!) this is a great buy great beans great company! buy with assurance!

" sure it's not 100% pure vanilla extract. that's indicated quite clearly in the ingredients. molina vanilla is made with a mixture of pure vanilla extract and synthetic vanillin. personally i love its strong distinctive flavor regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is. for those who feel it's too strong use half the amount listed in the recipe. i know a couple of people who do this when using molina vanilla. again i like the flavor so i use the full amount called for in the recipe. this stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch ",positive
" a friend brought me a large bottle back from his trip to mexico. i threw out all the other store bought vanilla bottles i had. they do not compare to this one. it has a strong rich flavor. i add to it everything i can. my chocolate chip cookies and french toast could not be complete without molina vanilla ",positive

" these crackers are absolutely delicious whether you need to be eating gluten free or not...i can't get enough of them. my favorite flavors are the plain and the herb flavored. these crackers are thin and crunchy and are just hard enough to be able to stick one in a jar of peanut butter and scoop a serving onto the cracker. i love them alone. i love them with tuna fish. i've used them for dipping salsa and guacamole but when i see them all disappearing quickly i hope i haven't used up my last box. being i am gluten intolerant this cracker has been a surprising lifesaver when i'm craving something crunchy and flavorful ",positive
" a friend introduced me to this coffee and i am addicted. i am an avid coffee drinker and this is the best coffee ever. i have never been a morning person but this coffee is now the highlight of my morning. i look forward to getting up. the coffee flavor was not in any way noticable chocolate to me but very sutle. i love this coffee ",positive
" the only refined sugar in this brownie mix is in the chocolate chips; otherwise it's naturally sweetened. and it's easier to put together than are the mundane supermarket brands: add one egg butter or oil (or applesauce if you're an oil-free person) and a little water. throw it in a 350-degree oven for 20 minutes. that's it. i'm an active home cook and a rather intense one (we make our own vanilla roast our own coffee beans) so it's no surprise that i'd say the results aren't as good as homemade. but they are _very_ good. and i could put the mix together between innings while watching a baseball game. how's _that_ for easy? i'll be making this mix again ",positive
" i have been enjoying this mix for quite some time. it is a great gluten-free way to satisfy chocolate cravings. although the brownies can be a bit on the chewy sidei would highly recommend making the cookie recipe shown on the bag. it makes really great chocolate cookies definitely the best gluten-free ones that i have come across in a mix so far. i have even passed these off at holiday parties as regular chocolate cookies and my guests loved them.

" i started drinking the bull in earnest in ramadi. i was on the quick reaction force and would get a startled awakening at 0'dark-thirty and have to drive a hmmv at 65+mph in the dark with night vision glasses. slurping a red bull on the way to the gate seemed to help me wake up and get a grip on the mission. it also made me wanna pee : ",positive
" red bull used to be my favorite drink as i would not go 24 hours without drinking an entire can. that era has ended simply because i was beginning to get sick of paying over $2.00 for one can. i know several distributors who offer the product for $1.50 but i seldomly stock up on the stuff and end up paying the $2.00 for a can plus 8% tax which comes out to $2.15 a can. which is fine with me until you realize that you are spending over 700 dollars a year at this rate. it never stopped me before and i always felt that it was worth it considering the drink helps me focus in college each morning. however i recently noticed that on days when i was not in school and i drank a red bull rather than being full of energy and ready to jog i would become tired. i began to wonder why i would get tired after drinking a can of red bull. maybe my inner body was saying stop drinking this **** every freaking day of your life! whatever the case is i decided to stop buying it on a daily basis and just drink it when i have to wake up very early. hopefully this can make it become effective on my body again because i think i may have overdone it considering i have probably consumed well over 1000 cans in my life. i personally enjoy drinking a cold can of red bull. set aside the energy factor. while many people (actually everyone i know) says it is sick and makes them gag i kinda like that cough droppy taste that is offered in a can of red bull. i find red bull to be a conversation starter for myself - kinda like smoker talk. i love to sip from my can of red bull and discuss the weather or some other exciting news with my peers. while i have tried so many other energy drinks i can say that i do hate all of them. there has never been an energy drink that i enjoyed other than red bull. i guess i just like the austrian people so much (and the fact that a can of red bull is vegan!) on the other hand it is full of man-made chemicals that might do some weird things to me in the future - only time will tell ",positive
" i've tried quite a few of the tasty bite products and this one is the best! what i do with this is mix it with rice. one pouch will typically give me 2 meals...putting in the fridge the other half for later that day or next day. ",positive
" this is one of my favorite tasty bite entres. it is spicy hot but not at all too hot with a noticeable curry flavor. the addition of the cashews makes for a nice flavor note (although i could do without the whole chile pod). i take mine in a mug with a pat of butter floating on top for a just-before-bed stomach warmer but you could easily pour it over rice for a quick easy and tasty lunch far more nutritious than a bowl of instant noodles. by the way the combination of pured greens and green peas is a terrific idea. i'd give this five stars if the peas weren't a little too redolent of the can. and with the free shipping this is a terrific price. ",positive
" i love indian food but my son (7) is not always as keen on it as i am. we're vegetarian and tried other tasty bite dishes before but none went well until i found agra peas and jodhpur lentils. my son wasn't sure about the green-ness but after explaining it's just green peas with sauce and coaxing him to try it he now asks for this all this time - really! i think these are a little milder in the exotic flavors and not as hot spicy. i suggest these as good choices for first time eaters of indian food. and i love how easy it is to warm up.

" nicely seasoned creamy texture. served over rice one packet makes a generous meal for one or would serve two with something on the side. cooked simply by boiling the packet in a pot of water until hot -- one of relatively few prepared food options where the microwave directions actually require more cleanup than the stovetop option. makes a good option for backpacking too assuming the weight is acceptable. requires no refrigeration and edible out of the packet with a spoon cold if necessary ",positive

" in a nutshell: fast - idiot proof - made for on the go - 5 calories this is really a very handy way to have a refreshing drink ready to go when water is just too bland by itself. just open the packet empty the contents into a bottle of water [how much h2o according to your taste] and shake it up. viola -- refreshment in an instant. or you can put the bottle [plastic] in the freezer and have an ice-cold lemonade later. what it is all about -- 'crystal light on the go packets lemonade drink mix' tastes great has very few calories is an ideal carbonated beverage alternative and most of all --- it's ez to make on the go - fast. it's also rather reasonably priced. my only reservation -- aspartame some people do have bad reactions to aspartame but most people know by now whether or not it affects them adversely. i would rather have 'splenda' as the sweetener but maybe that will be available soon. through kraft there is a neat website which contains nutritional and other info about crystal light - [http://www.kraftfoods.com/crystallight/] [i am not affiliated with any product or company] ",positive
" i like water but i still like these packets. all you do is put the mix in shake it up and it's lemonade. it's like magic. they are perfect for anywhere and they taste good too. they are great for traveling. i absoulutley love them ",positive
" as someone who absolutely hates water crystal light was a life saver for me. now that they make it in little packets 'to go' i can put several in my purse when i go on business trips or vacation and feel good about buying bottled water. i'm doing what doctors suggest we all do - drink lots of water - yet doing it with something that makes it taste good! the only complaint i have - if you can call it a complaint - is that they haven't come out with kiwi-strawberry in the individual packets yet. that is by far my favorite flavor. lemonade comes in a close second. i highly recommend this product. ~ leanne burroughs author of highland wishes and her highland rogue ",positive

" okay... this is one of those foods that i never guessed that i'd be making so often. as a college student sure. maybe a box once and a while as a young married couple. but as a new mom my motto was my child won't be eating.... [actually you could fill in a number of items into that space.] and yet i find myself the purveyor of many many meals that involve noodles and cheese. once in awhile these may be whole wheat organic noodles but more often than not it is one of the few foods my stubborn toddler-now preschooler will eat: kraft macaroni and cheese. pros --lets face it the biggest pro is that testy tikes will eat it. let's call it tasty then. --the meal is quick and has 9 grams of protein per serving. --it has no transfats unless you add them. --provides 10% of adult iron requirements-which translates as an even higher percentage for children. cons --cost a buck per box on amazon. --since wheat flour is `processed' doesn't have a lot of fiber (1 gram). --processed flour probably means higher glycemic index (though that should be moderated by the addition of oil/butter and milk. --lots of sodium (740 mg). --lots of calories (380 prepared per adult serving) which is not necessarily bad if you are trying to fill up a toddler. four stars. my greatest wish would be for an organic whole wheat with flax kraft mac & cheese but until that day comes i am happy that kraft makes a tasty affordable meal in a box that children will eat. just add veg and you are ready to go ",positive

" speaking as someone who has to watch her carb intake carefully i was not keen on trying yet another item that claimed to be low-carb and good-tasting. so often the two do not go together especially when dealing with the traditional more carby foods such as pasta bread rice etc. dreamfields is a happy exception. this is not to say you can cook up a whole box and eat it all at once (those who have to watch carb intake will still need to do some portion control) but you can actually have a large scoop of delicious hot pasta alone or in your culinary creations and not blow your carb allowance. and this is not some flimsy dissolving cardboard-tasting pasta; it cooks up hearty and substantial. when you eat it it fills up that i am so hungry for carbs i could eat a ton of potatoes need. satisfying delicious filling and easier on the insulin levels than regular pasta. i love it!

" new to thai cuisine i asked to try a milder curry my tastes running to a maximum of medium heat. yellow curry was recommended and the coconut milk based thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something i've had occasion to order again and again. so when trying to re-create the taste sensations above i was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications. i did some research and found that many thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups curries and more. mae ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting. this brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels with the yellow curry paste being the first i was eager to try. it has a shelf life of 2 years and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator. the flavors of lemon grass shallot gingery galanga kaffir lime peel warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. this is the only mae ploy curry paste without shrimp paste making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish fish or fowl. i like to snip off one corner of the clear packet then squeeze out just the amount i need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 tablespoons depending on the recipe. this helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste. for thai curry i will combine the yellow curry paste with a small amount of chicken broth then add 3/4 cup more broth per person plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. a cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety. mae ploy's thai yellow curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip salad dressing or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through (about 15-20 minutes at 325). the fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and i would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price without tedious preparation ",positive

" my boyfriend just found out the hard way that he has a wheat gluten allergy. i've tried experimenting with different non wheat fours but they're expensive and don't turn out very well.

" i love earthbound mini carrots. they taste sweet and you don't find dried out pieces in bag like in some other companies. i eat them out of the bag as a snack. i boil these and mash them with potatoes and use the water in soups and various dishes. on the downside mini carrots which are young carrots are abruptly pulled out of the ground by their hair. the carrots' skin is then peeled off and stuffed in a plastic bag while still living. then they are eaten alive or boiled alive. and the're babies!!! yes little carrots are babies and we eat them. it's cruel world if your a carrot ",positive
" these taste like real carrots and not the things that have been sprayed with who knows what and grown wherever. i buy these all the time since they never seem to last long in our house. they are particularly nice dipped in ranch dressing with bacon bits and just have a sweeter flavor. when kids are grabbing them all the time instead of cookies well then i guess that's all you can say! highly recommend ",positive

" there are an awful lot of recipes for chili. many winning recipes from the international chili society use gebhardt's as a base. in my kitchen it is an excellent start to a good bowl of red. i have used this chili mix several times and always end up with good chili. this mix supplies no thickener no salt and no heat. these you must add yourself which is a good thing; you can really customize to your liking. this my preference per pound of meat: 1 tablespoon of gebhardt's 1/2 teaspoon of salt 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne and no thickener. i also find that this mix needs (per # of meat): 2 cloves of garlic 1 teaspoon tomato paste 1 teaspoon of cumin seed 1 teaspoon of mexican (not greek) oregano. i have always enjoyed chili made with this mix and highly recommend it as a standard ingredient on your shelf. a fabulous way to prepare a whole pot of meat for those summer events.

" the pouch is vacuum sealed and holds about 100gms of delicate deep-emerald leaves. i use about a tsp for a 12-16oz cup. it is very important to avoid using boiling water if you want to get the full benefits and flavor of this tea. water at a rolling boil will overcook the tea and you will notice that the tea quickly turns brown in the cup. if you adhere to directions and use water at 80 deg. c. you will be left with a wonderful cup of green tea that stays green. i absolutely love the fresh grassy flavor of this tea and it is a wonderful pick-me-up. the first sip of this tea leaves a distinctly sweet note on the tongue even though there is no actual sugar in the tea! i have spent hundreds on different teas but i keep returning to this one as my staple ",positive

" these have been my favorite cookies for over 20 years now both in new york & california. i just love the shortbread and the fudgy center and have never found another cookie that even compares. recently i moved to the southeast tho and panicked when i couldn't find any stella d'oro cookies anywhere! i'm so happy to find them here at amazon where i'm a regular shopper anyway; now i can add them to my order everytime i buy something! ",positive
" these cookies are so addictive and there is no lack of fudge on them which that is a plus. other brand of their swiss fudge cookies is not as perfect as they believe it is. the outside of the cookie does not blend well with the little bit of fudge they put on it. keep making this wonderful cookie and i hope the stores will stock them again ",positive
" stella d'ora fudge cookies were the best dessert i could find in my lunchbox growing up. its crisp cookie with fudgie middle was perfect with milk or hot tea. many times i would eat the cookie part and save the fudge center for last to test my patience because there was nothing like eating that chocolate. stella d'ora was a brand common in nyc grocery stores (and throughout nj) so everytime i would visit relatives there i would buy the breakfast cookies annisettes and the fudge cookies. i have seen the breadsticks in nc but nothing else so its so nice to find that amazon has them. stela d'ora always seemed so refined since they were italian and for adults who liked a little treat with their coffee or cappucinos. my father used to dunk his cookies in coffee and they would become warm and gooey while i preferred them crisp with milk. either way try a package of this and some other biscuits. they really are unbelievably good. ",positive
" these cookies are amazing. i challenge anyone to find a finer packaged cookie than stella d'oro's swiss fudge cookies. they aren't overly sweet but they are incredibly flavorful. i don't think these are distributed in the midwest/south (i've never seen them) so it's really great that amazon has them for me to order! thanks!

" tasty bite punjab eggplant is delicious and spicy. try adding a bit of plain yogurt. serve with rice or bread (nan or pita work well) and you have a brilliant meal that costs only a few dollars. this is true of all of the tasty bite indian entrees. i wish the tasty bite thai meals came as entrees (i.e. without the rice or noodles) so i could streach them out into a big meal by adding my own rice or noodles. tasty bite entrees are really easy to keep on hand since they don't have to be refrigerated. buying in bulk works well for these. ",positive
" this has good flavor but be warned it is quite hot as well. enjoy:- ",positive
" i've tried lots of coffee pods and black mountain gold is by far the best!! the flavor is always full and rich never bitter. the cinnamon crumb cake is delicious. ",positive
" a friend shared her marketspice tea with me years ago and i was so pleased to run across an old brochure she had given me. i ordered some and that wonderful taste was still the same. the teabags are so fresh and full of flavor that the oils in the tea cling to the clear bag they come in. it's a flavor you won't find anywhere else. you can taste the orange and the cinnamon and they're just a little sweet - you may not need to even sweeten yours! ",positive
" for those of you who love the cinnamon taste this tea is by far the best i have ever had. the stronger the better! ",positive
" awesome tea i highly recommend it. has a kick to it spice and orange flavor. great customer service. ",positive
" the antioxidant properties of goji berries are ones you can feel immediately upon consuming them. they're a legit superfood however the price is outrageous. if you're comparing them with a dried snack fruit like raisins they're 8x the cost (for organic). if paying $6 for an afternoon snack is up your alley then there probably isn't a much better snack for you than these goji berries. my only beef with goji berries are that they are bone dry. so dry in fact they could hurt your teeth if you have sensitive teeth. i actually know someone who chipped a tooth on goji berries. soaking them is ideal and then using the juice in smoothies not to waste the antioxidants that washed off into the water.

" my boyfriend is a huge fan of duck. he loves it. roast duck duck a l'orange chicken-fried duck duck varsovia braised duck duck chow mein duck-n-dumplins duck in claret etc... you get the idea. anyway we were cuddling in bed one night and he said i picked up a tub of rendered duck fat from amazon.com and it is really tasty stuff. i said oh yeah? and he said yeah. let me get it and let you try it. so one thing led to another and we ended up using it you know intimately. woooo! we'll never use k-y again ",positive
" i bought mine at walmart a few years ago and haven't seen them since. these are so fun even to sit on the coffee table during the holidays when guests come over. you push down on the back of the reindeer and the tails lifts to let a bean drop out. it's a riot. they are small but hilarious and lots of fun! i recommend this for anyone who has a sense of humor ",positive
" my kids got a kick out of finding these in their stockings on christmas morning ",positive
" this was hilarious. all the teen boys enjoyed this as a gag gift. order was processed shipped and delivered in a timely manner ",positive
" i have given this gift three times all three times to lonely old guys on the internet with no love life and bady body odor (i assume). each time they ate the jellybeans and enjoyed the way the beans fell from the reindeer's butt. i think it pleases bachelors and therefor pleases me ",positive
" this is a great gift for that person in your family who still thinks fart jokes are funny or for ten year olds. only one problem. due to inconsistant sizes of jelly beans the poor raindeer had a...dispensing problem on occaission which requires one to rip off the reindeer's head (thank goodness it's on a hinge) to alleviate the problem this could be traumatic to the more sensitive.. merry christmas!! ",positive
" this is very hot at first but then it calms down. dave's insanity stays hot longer. but my husband is happy with the both of them ",positive
" i have to tell you i have been a fan of spicy food for the last 20 years. i have tried wicked salsas and crazy-hot sauces. i thought i had seen it all until i received dave's total insanity as a gift last christmas. i arrived home from work and decided to give this sauce a try. we were having rice for dinner and i launched a generous topping of dave's total insanity into the mix and dug in. oh my! this stuff was no hot i had to throw out the whole dinner. i put way too much in. i never expected nuclear meltdown. friends this stuff isn't child's play. heck i wouldn't even secretly put it in my enemy's food. i might get arrested. dave's total insanity has a great taste and is perfect for the spicy food lover in your life but don't go slathering it on your pile of chicken wings until you have a small taste first. you will waste a meal unless you use it in moderation ",positive
" johnny's is great for steaks burgers chicken....just about anything. much better than lowrey's seasoned salt ",positive
" i use this -- for the most part -- instead of bread. i am bi-coastal and i keep these in the freezer both home in nyc and out west. i will have one or two a day and that is it for bread products. two is 120 calories. you can use them to wrap anything you like. if you want some tensile strength just leave one on the counter for a while before using. this has cache. who wouldn't want a crepe as a sort of ultimate gourmet taco? not knockin' tacos or bread but if you are a minimalist like me you want few things that are great. these take up no room. you can order them in bulk. among my uses -- to wrap concoctions i create and make a meal. yyou do not neeed much of a concocktion. max two tablespoonfuls. to put melted cheeze on and wrap up and make a meal. to put a spoonful of icecream on and wrap up and make a treat. to put a bit of preserves on and roll up for my equivalent of a treat. and you know what? when you do not need any they are still there taking up little room and available whenever you get the urge. bread substitute? well everyone needs bread. i still go out for breakfast in nyc and will have a bialy. but before i used to do three bialy's worth of bread a day. i have cut that by more than half. as far as i know this is the only product like this. i am well satisfied. class act from california ",positive
" ume-en is one of the best brands of green tea powder i have ever tasted. this tea has a light delicate flavor with just a touch of sweetness which serves to make drinking this beverage a delightful relaxing and rejuvenating experience. with this drink tea time is going to take on a whole new meaning. i would definitely recommend this product ",positive
