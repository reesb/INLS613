" i bought this watch for my husband but didn't take the time to read the description carefully. so it's my fault i had to send it back. he is in the army and leaving soon for iraq. i thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift. unfortunately it does not work if you're more than 2000 miles from colorado. if you are not going to leave the continental united states i suppose it would be a good watch ",negative

" these earrings were very uncomfortable. i'm not sure if it's actually the size of the post so much as the shape and angle--more like an angled bar than a round post. i don't have particularly sensitive ears although i generally don't wear large or heavy jewelry either. these earrings are on their way back to amazon. i also wasn't thrilled to see how much the price has varied. when i ordered--4/6/07--they were $34.99. some reviewers bought them for less yet the current price seems to be even more. caveat emptor ",negative
" these earrings are very pretty but the post is way too thick. they killed my ears and i had to return them. i would guess the post is at least 2.5 times as thick as a normal post and my ears did not like it!!! ",negative
" i was very disappointed in these earrings. they were only about the size of a nickel and for $50 i expected them to be as large as earrings i have found from several other merchants for the same price. if you are looking for average size hoops -- say the size of a quarter -- these are not the earrings for you. i can only imagine how tiny the $30 pair is ",negative
" my 5-year-old daughter was thrilled with her locket. it is really beautiful. we were both quite disappointed however when the locket itself broke...the loop that attaches to the bail completely came off. she is a normal kid but was not overly rough with the necklace. it is currently at the jeweler's to be fixed ",negative
" we bought this locket for my daughter and had it personalized with her initials on one side and the year on the other. this is such a small locket that it will be very hard to put a picture in it. also the locket is very very hard to open. the top of the heart wasn't closed all the way so the locket kept falling off the chain we had to have it fixed. now it stays together my daughter loves it and wears it every day but i would have bought a different locket if i had realized how small this is and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn ",negative
" the locket on this cable chain is so tiny you will not be able to put a picture in it. after opening the box and being completely disappointed i opened the locket to see how it worked. it would not close properly after opening. the quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money. ",negative
" these were nice earings which i received as a gift off my wish list. but after i wore them about 3 or 4 times one of them fell out and is now lost. the post does not stay in place very well. i am frustrated because i put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an innovative clasp which avoids lost earings. but they did not work well for me. by the way after i first wrote this review i called amazon to complain. they sent me another pair right away at no charge. this suggests to me that others have complained in the past. i appreciate that they were so responive. ",negative
" i ordered this watch and i got a woman's watch. the model number was the same. i don't know if there was a mix up but what i got was definitely not a men's watch. luckily amazon has a great return policy ",negative
" this is way too small for a men's watch both the face and the band -- the band wouldn't even go around my wrist. i think this must be a women's watch mislabled. nice looking but i sure can't use it -- i'm going to have to return it ",negative
" i bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews. i thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches rather than paying $10 each time to have a professional do it. i was so disappointed in this tool. the link remover only pushes the pins out halfway. you are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way. as you can imagine this is not easy. my husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out. knowing what i know now i would definitely have invested in a different link remover ",negative
" the product pretty much snapped in half while i was trying to remove two links from one watch. the other one i tried before this one didn't fit in the adjustment piece at all. so with that said do not buy this product at all. it's very poorly made and terribly annoying to use. instructions are very unclear. i ended up throwing it away and going to a watch shop to get it fixed ",negative
" this supposedly new item looked like it had been either used a few times or someone had left it out in the rain. it arrived with the one-page instruction sheet wrapped around the plastic tool. the silver knob that you can see on the left side of this tool was rusted and would not turn very easily. i'm not sure how this tool is effective in removing stubborn watch band pins. maybe this tool is effective in only removing pins from cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item. when i attempted to use it the entire plastic body would flex and i was afraid that it would snap if i twisted the knob any further. not worth the sale price that it was advertised. the most effective way of using it was to remove the knob and pin from the apparatus and gently tap the end with a hammer in order to loosen the pins. this is definitely not worth the sale price ",negative
" i had loved it at first but i am one to leave a necklace on forever. it started to get all kinked up and i couldn't figure out how to straighten it out. but the company did offer me a discount on a different chain even though it was past their 30 day policy. nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it ",negative
" this ring had such great ratings after visiting it often i finally bought it as a gift. when i saw it in person i was not impressed. it does look like the picture but it also looks cheap. i do realize it costs cheap i just wasn't impressed. it did arrive very quickly though ",negative
" this was a cute locket but far too small to put any sort of a photo in it . the only use it would serve would be a charm never to be opened. not worth the price ",negative
" i bought this watch for a gift. overall the watch is nice but it doesn't work properly. we will have to send it to fossil for repair ",negative
" for $10 these were too good to pass up. first noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece. first time i wore them lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out. this is the second pair i bought... first set was fine. seems like the quality of construction may be slipping (or a different supplier?) ",negative
" though the design is cool the quality of this pendant is poor. they are so light and the color is strikingly white which makes them appear cheaper. they look like toys! i also bought the earrings set with the same design and i'm so disappointed with both. :-( only the packaging is of good quality in this product. i suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design. ",negative
" though evenly matched the color of the amethysts are much lighter than the product image. both stones are feathered in areas and have visible blemishes though these aren't apparent if you are wearing them. about the quality you'd expect from mervyn's or sears on sale. not terrible but not great ",negative
" the color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. a darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. i won't buy jewelry from amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. hsn depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products ",negative
" after about 3 weeks of wearing the necklace the cord came loose from the metal fasteners. the glue used to keep the cord from unraveling was comepletely useless and the cord became unwound. the cord looks very nice but the quality is terrible ",negative
" it's doesn't look like as it appears in the photos...i bought it to gift my husband and i wz very disappointed !! i returned it back ! ",negative
" there two major problems with this watch. one auto-atomic setting do not work as described in manual. second unable to even set time using good old fashion manual way. returned to casio for repair hope they get it right ",negative
" if you check out the page you find this womens watch for $133.99 you will also find the mens version for just $98.00. why would this be? if anthing because of the gold plating and the mens watch being much larger it would cost more to make the mens watch. more size more gold more gold higher price to make. another little thing that bothers me is both watches are shown together with a little better together hook. better for who? there is not once cent in discount for buying together. i own an invicta and have had no trouble with it. i would buy the pair for my wife and i. but i am not going to toss out an extra $35.99 for the womens watch just because invicta and/or amazon feel they can charge more for if anything a product that would not cost as much to make. man it seems that the women would really get hot over this ",negative
" fair warning--had i had the benefit of some of the reviews that have since appeared about this company's watches i never would have bought one. do yourself a favor and read the reviews for the various models before wasting your money. the percentage of watches that work for any length of time is distressingly low ",negative
" i was very excited to get these earrrings for my daughter for christmas however upon opening found that one of the front of the earrings was dented. now i need to return them. other than the dent they were cute. even though they were only $25.00 there should be some quality control by the manufacturer ",negative
" i love the actually pendent the time it got there was great. but i really didn't like how they show the pendent on a chain because i bought it for the whole package (chain included). so when i got it i was shocked that it didn't included it. so buyers beware this supplier doesn't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra $15-$30 even thou they adversities it in their ad. ",negative
" i purchased this watch for my granddaughter as her first watch. however it never worked. i don't know if it had a dead battery or if it's broken. the cost to replace the battery will be nearly as much as i paid for the watch. i will try to resolve the issue with amazon ",negative
" the earrings are nice & a great value at $30. however the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore. the posts are not the typical size one might find in us stores. the posts are more typical of earrings that i have purchased in central & southern america; in fact this is where the earrings were made. i returned them ",negative
" this ring does not look as pictured. it arrived today (almost 3 weeks after i ordered it) and is extremely thin has tarnish marks and the metal filigree on the crown shows up only in random places. it looks like it came out of a vending machine and i'm obviously pretty disappointed. i won't be buying anything from this vendor again ",negative
" actually i only wore it 2 days to work. i took it off at night and put it on in the mornings. on the 3rd day i noticed the silver peeling off. i tossed it. i know it was inexpensive but that was down right cheap. never again!!!! ",negative
" make sure you read the fine print! this bracelet is silver toned not sterling silver. the embossing is also not the greatest - clear on the one side but hard to see the letters on the other ",negative
" first of all i would like to mention that the invicta brandthat exists and produces watches nowadayshas nothing to do with the swiss company that bears the same namebut went into bankruptcy a few decades ago.the actual invicta company is an american one and has bought the rights to use this name. the mechanisms are swiss made or made in japan.about the ones made in switzerland i cannot post an opinion.this particular model(9211)which i purchased this yearhas a japanese mechanism(made by myota i think).every 24 hours it loses some precious secondssoafter a few days it becomes a matter of minutes.in conclusion it has a problem with precisionbeeing unable to keep time with accuracy. i would advise anyone who wants to buy this watch to think twice.of course the discount price is attractive but the watch doesn't meet it's expectasions;i consider that a minimum dose of accuracy is required.the only good aspect about this watch is it's appearance. learn from other's mistakes... ",negative
" this watch looks good but the movement is terrible. i got this watch as a christmas gift but the 24 hour register was synchronized to the hour hand. i must warn you if you purchase this watch then don't be suprised if it doesn't work right. it may look like a rolex but it doesn't work like one ",negative
" i bought two of these one for each of my boys for christmas. one of the two watches never did keep time properly. i even changed the battery. an expensive fix that did not work. ",negative
" this item was a nice gift. the stones were a little discolored but that's what you get for only paying $100 for 1/4 carat earings online : ",negative
" one earring was damaged and instead of replacing it as i requested they fixed it. i will not be using amazon to purchase jewelry anytime soon ",negative
" i purchased two of these necklaces but the first one broke the second time i wore it. good thing i purchased two. ",negative
" the clip holds the money but the credit card holder is a bit scary. it just doesn't work that well. plus it is very heavy. if you put 5 bills in there even without the credit cards this thing is like putting a brick in your pocket. i would not recommend it ",negative
" as title says. there were kind of a water mark on the face of the watch maybe a leak from the solar panel? i did not exchange for another one because it is a cheap watch no point paying shipping back and forth. anyways the instructions were easy to understand buttons on the side a little bit hard to push. blue led on red face looks bad because of the dark face for the solar panel it is not easy to see. this watch is now sitting on my desk collecting dust i am just waiting to see when the solar panel stop leaking and the watch fail ",negative
" this watch was a disappointment; it has a huge dial but the chronograph functions are extremely tiny. it's also an extremely flashy watch - the image on the web-site makes it look classy - not so. additionally the watch is completely useless under low light conditions - it neither fluoresces nor does it have a light-up function. returned it after a week got my money back ",negative
" the product doesnt appear as is shown on the picture at all. its not red and its too small to even imagine.i knew it would appear bit smaller than on picture but this is beyond my imagination.the chain can break any time!!! and the stud!!!!!!!gosh...i cant even see it! now i'm gonna check if its really gold or not!! dont buy this product!save yourself the money ",negative
" don't buy this item...i was cheated...now i am gonna send it back. its really waste of your money. don't go by the price...i will never buy anything from this site ",negative
" like the looks of the watch. however it's very noisy and the clasp tends to come apart after removing the watch. the face can also be difficult to read in bright light (reflection) ",negative
" nice looking but with very serious design and/or manufacturing flaw - after less than 2 month of use in office environment glass cracked without any impact whatsoever. now i'll have to find out if skagen's customer service is any good. for $70 watch i certainly expected better quality. after reading other reviews for this models i realized that many other people had the same issue. bottom line -avoid!! ",negative
" these were the worst pair of earings i have ever seen. they were yellow from a mile away. amazon was very accomodating when i returned them but save yourself the hassle the price is too good to be true with these earings ",negative
" the quality of the stones is horrendous there are significant inclusions which are visible with naked eye from as far away as 3 feet. these diamons should have been turned into diamond dust not set into jewelery ",negative
" these diamonds shouldn't be offered in this size for jewelry. the imperfections in them seriously hinder the sparkling characteristics a diamond is known for. great price - but you get what you pay for ",negative
" i bought these for my young daughter. i understood the basics of diamond ratings and wasn't concerned with the inclusions they may have contained. i expected low quality stones with some particles visable to the naked eye. what i didn't expect was the cloudiness. although these weren't yellow in color they were the absolute worst pair of diamonds i had ever seen. there was no clarity just two milky looking stones. these diamonds should have been grinded and used for diamond dust or chips only ",negative
" i can see why they are priced so low i figured that they would look like the photo or something like it but the ones i received are very cloudy. i guess you get what you are paying for. as for the k clarity i have no idea what that is so i never thought they would look this bad ",negative
" i like itbut i don't like box's watch which obsolescence.i hope my boy friend will love it ",negative
" i purchased this watch as a birthday present for my husband. when he opened it he noticed that the days of the week were in both spanish and english and there doesn't seem to be a way to set it to just one or the other since there were limited instructions with the watch. by the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund. not happ ",negative
" i returned the pearl earings. they were of very poor quality. the colors were not pretty and the shapes were not even. ",negative
" this watch does not work according to the manual. i have tryed to get it to work about 75 times my wife has tryed about at least 25-30 times and i took it to a jewler and even he could not get it to work. this watch is a piece of jun ",negative
" great watchmanual very bad.all depends on how much time you have to invest.it will take it because of sorry manual ",negative
" as per the review i decided to buy the item. i received it. it was very thick and ugly looking. it just looks good in the picture. as mentioned by someone it has plastic back cover which makes it worse. it also is very large and long. so to remove the small braces cost more. overall unhappy and returned to amazon with loss of money in shipping ",negative
" daylight savings time in the us has changed. these watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules. while you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks twice a year it kind of defeats the whole purpose ",negative
" bought this as a christmas gift for a cousin who is mentally handicapped. thought i could program it and have him enjoy the ease of reading the hands and the glow in the dark feature. however it is now january 18th and i still cannot program the watch. frustrate ",negative
" as a talisman it is good but the product/metal it is made of is critical ",negative
" it was larger than i expected from the images thicker too. in my opinion it didn't look as classy as the picture made me believe. i was very disappointed that the regular second hand was not in fact the large sweeping thin hand that's actually only for the stop watch. the regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle. really with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which and the cheaper look of the watch in person i never actually put it on before sending it back ",negative
" these were on my mom's wishlist so i bought them. they just arrived and i'm totally disappointed. i'd return them if it wouldn't cost me and i wasn't so lazy. they look pretty darn cheap for starters. also they came in a little plastic zipper bag inside of a little pseudo-velour bag with a price tag for $3.30 on it. save your money. it's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen ",negative
" the topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth $45 but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page. the shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5/16 long; the larger stone is about 3/16 wide and 1/4 high; the small stone is about 3/32 wide. essentially you get what you pay for ",negative
" i've purchased this watch a month ago and although it's nice the battery died already. very dissapointed.. ",negative
" i bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch. the v-notched end was too thick to fit - i used my pocket knife instead. maybe there's a knack to it but i didn't want to scratch my watch while practicing. the pointed end works very well for pressing in those tiny spring bars and the small recessed auto-set buttons for which a ball-point tip is too big and a needle is too clumsy. but you probably have something around the house that would work just as well (mini-screwdriver the point of a phillips head...

" i was very disappointed with how tiny this eternity cross is. i don't know if the measurements were in the description for it or not or if they were and i just didn't see or pay attention to them but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it's meant for a very young child. the necklace may be 18 but the pendant itself was so small not at all what i was looking for. so i'm going to give this as a gift for a niece. what i was really wanting was a larger heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult. never have found one yet.

" when i received the earrings i got very disappointed because they are very very small. i had to sell them my wife never wanted to wear them ",negative
" my order arrived quickly but upon first use the clasp broke on this necklace. since it wasn't an expensive item i joined the ends together with a small wire ring i already owned since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced...perhaps with another faulty item. as they say you get what you pay for! ",negative
" i recieved it promptly but it didn't work. i took it to walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler. i did that buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right. i've read the manual over and over. my sons did the same. it looks nice but doesn't work and its been very aggravating. i wouldn't recommend it ",negative
" i got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch. after wearing invicta's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist. when i received it i noticed the small scratches all over the crystal. nothing deep but they really pick up the glare. atomic signal i am unable to get it to pick up one. in memphis tn i think i should be in range and all my atomic clocks sync up fine. i have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house. still no good. basically i spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight. lesson learned ",negative
" this looked great when it came but broke in only one day. really poor craftmanship. ",negative
" i bought these for my mom she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment. the entire earring is tiny the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver from not very far away at all they just look like a gray blob very hard to tell what shape. not impressed i suggest you look for something else. i will be returning these immediatel ",negative
" here is an example of the deception of photos on the net. the smallest photo they showed of these earings was 4x larger than the actual product!! we had to put them on our 9 month old grandaughter and even then they still appeared tiny on her baby ears!! rip off never buy jewlery from amazon again!

" i have owned several timex ironman watches over the years. loved 'em all. i don't if amazon sent me one with an almost dead battery or if it's a flaw in the watch. however when punching through the modes everything is really slow. if i go to alarm i have to wait a few seconds for it to appear then wait a few more when i choose to modify it. not quick an easy like my other ironmans. great features though if it wasn't for this annoying delay 5 stars easy. so i don't know to blame amazon or timex for this. either way it is a problem that dropped the score for me ",negative
" it might just be really bad luck but after three fossil watches (1 x blue 2 x titanium) i've never managed to make them last more than two years each. they are really cool look great and the price is reasonable. but this is the third time fossil lets me down. and to get them repaired through the warranty is extremely painful. this time i'm looking for another brand as i feel i'm wasting my money ",negative

" i bought these for my 83 year old mom she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. we thought it would be a good deal for the price. she was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived but as others have noted these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes these earrings are going to droop downwards not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. needless to say my moms ear lobes are very thin as soon as she put them in her ears they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. she was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund ",negative

" when i first got this watch i was thrilled. it has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination. the problem started when i went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists. the guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing. at the time i thought he was just po'd because i didnt buy the watch at the store. as soon as i was home though the bracelet fell apart. what a piece of junk! i regret buying this watch and i advise against it.

" very disappointed in the watch and amazon. the day/date did not work on delivery but i was unaware of it until the end of february when i tried to manually change the date. i found that it was broken at that time about a week after i received the watch. the day/date did change automatically each night. amazon refused t orepalce it because i had the band adjusted. seiko refused t oreplace it but said they would repair it and have it back to me in 3-4 weeks! had i purchased it from a reputable local store i could have exchanged it for a new watch.

" seiko has produced a loser of a watch. i really liked the design and seiko reputation of building a tough watch. i have purchased seiko divers in the past with no problems. i didn t know these watches were made in singapore. maybe this is why my monster doesn t work. who knows toke to authurized dealer for repair . he wanted $ 175. dont buy seiko ",negative
" pardon me if i also wish to review anonymously. i now can come forward with my negative experience with the seiko black monster too after seeing a handful of other ex-owners post theirs. i had my seiko black monster skx779k1 for about three weeks when it also did a freeze of all its movements and sounds. no sweep motion no tick-tock of any sort. but unlike someone else's experience mine never sprang to life anymore. after i shook it gently sideways to wind it up its second hand moved for only about 10-12 seconds then stopped again. i did this watch cpr several times but still always failed to resucitate it. my watch also was forming a light miss on the inside of its crystal a day after i used in while doing the dishes of all things. this is a divers watch? i already packed it up last thursday for return and dropped it off at my local usps and im still thinking whether to give it a chance and get another black monster or to get an entirely different model or brand. i must day that i am disappointed big time in this watch! i loved the way it looked and it really made me felt bad to return it. but to me a watch is an instrument first an accessory only second.

" i would rate this zero stars but the system will not allow me to do this - hence the one star.i bought this watch for my wife as a 2006 christmas present. the crystal subsequently cracked due to temperature changes. the elegant design of a thin gold rim holding the crystal cannot stand large rapid temperature differences. i went to my local jeweler who was very familiar with the crystal issue with skagen watches. i called skagen seems they are aware of this problem too. however the only option offered was to send the watch back for repair -pay $25.00 for repair of the crystal pay $8.95 for s&h and then pay insurance and return postage. as i paid $65.00 for the watch i consider this a total ripoff. i would not buy another product from skagen and recommend that amazon discontinue selling any skagen products until they become a responsible corporate partner. it is a pretty watch and seemed like a good deal - but it is not turning out that way. or you can buy this watch and only wera it in warm climates ",negative

" i love this watch. it has radio controlled time so it gives you exact time automatically. easy to read numerials. watch is attactive. the only down side is that it is a little bit on the heavy side. ",positive
" the watch is solar powered and time is synchronized with an atomic clock. i'm not sure how that works (radio waves?) but the watch is extremely accurate. the watch charges easily - put it under a light when you take it off- and it has a powersaving feature that kicks in when there is no light source (i.e. it's dark). the buttons/settings work similarly to a battery powered g-shock but there is a little more complexity because you have to set your home city for the atomic clock sync to work right. it's the first casio i've owned with a metal band. unless you're a gorilla you'll need to remove some links from the watch band. i did this myself but you may want to take it to a jewelry store cause they have the right tools. i love the watch. it is everything you would expect from a g-shock ",positive
" the strap/links on these g-shocks are quite oversized: when i first got it i could fit the watch around my legs! (you'll most likely have to get the links adjusted). ironically the four side buttons on the watch is small. so even if you have a huge wrist you'll probably have trouble pressing the buttons! (not for huge fingers) ***beware*** the picture shows the four side buttons on the watch in silver but the left and right side buttons on this model is actually plain black! it is quite misleading! the silver side button is actually the mtg920dj model (which is the 2005 version). according to casio the mtg920da was actually released in 2004 with black side buttons. if you search the casio website it will only display the mtg920dj (their most recent version); most websites that still sell the mtg920da are just taking the latest mtg920dj version picture from casio's website. the mtg920dj seems to have the same features as this one (mtg920da) except the four side (left and right) buttons are in silver. for those of you wondering about the three circles on the watch: the first one on the very left is basically a wannabe-analog display - basically every five minutes a bar increases (or decreases when it gets full); it's just mostly there for cosmetic reasons. the second one in the middle is the battery status; it has an l (low) m (medium) and h (high) and the bar would display in one of those areas. if you get out in the sun a lot or know an area in your home where the sun shines a lot then you won't have a problem with the battery ever going below high. moreover it has a power saving feature; the watch will go into sleep mode (display off) when it is in a completely dark area for a long time. finally the third circle on the very right is where it tells you what options are enabled/disabled. it shows spl (split time for stopwatch) dst (daylight saving time) sig (hourly signal) alm (alarm) snz (snooze) and auto el (automatic electro-luminescent backlight - the backlight turns on by tilting it a certain degree towards your face without having to manually press the backlight button.) keep in mind synchronizing with the atomic signal is not instant: it usually takes around 3 minutes (at least for me i live in california.) and if you're in a busy area or near an electronic it might be difficult; try again or move to a different area. moreover it should show you the strength/level (4 levels) of the signal (while you're synchronizing) with a satellite icon on the watch. there is also a feature that automatically synchornizes for you while you're sleeping at 2:00am 3:00am 4:00am and 5:00am. therefore it's not always necessary to syncronize it yourself because by the time you wake up it should be ready to go. overall this watch is attractive and fun to wear. the atomic radio signal feature is very cool; having the official time is great - right to the precise second! i've had this watch for months now and i enjoy wearing it daily. this watch does have a lot of feature - except it's a pity it does ***not*** have a countdown timer! pros: - cool design - water/scratch resistant; g-shock are known for their toughest watches. (update: i've worn this watch daily for almost a year and a half now and not a single scratch - still looks brand new!) - solar power; battery life is excellent; never had the power ever go below high. power saving feature. - position of the time and date is easy to read at one glance. - metal strap - can display world time with local time cons: - the side buttons are small and tight to press (must use like the very tip of the fingers) - atomic signal takes too long manually and it usually is not possible to synchronize while wearing the watch; if you're inside the home it is usually best to take off the watch and leave it near a window. - alarm beep can be a little longer perhaps (even my inexpensive timex watch would beep and it would gradually beep faster which i actually like a bit better.) - no countdown timer. (how could they forget this?!) also try to research other models instead of finding out the hard way (like i did about the side buttons) before purchasing. ",positive

" i've owned several watches including the older g-shock and the casio men's g-shock atomic solar watch # gw1400da-9av (among others). first there are so many g-shock models to choose from. you could have bought the # gw1400da-9av (the stainless steel model) for the same price ($75) during the week of july 24 2006. this watch simply has everything one ever needs for time functionality: solar power (no need for daily rewinding kinetic body movement or batteries) synch with the atomic clock in colorado (ultimate accuracy) time zone adjustment (ease for jet setters) light button (which also goes off when you tilt your wrist) stop watch functionalities day/date functionalities and countless other time-related functions. in this respect it's much more functional than a patek (even the complicated wrist watch models or the more mundane rolex etc.). of course it's a lowly casio costing a mere $75 (vs. $75000 for a low end complicated patek) buyers should be aware that the watch is purtty bulky probably 5/8 to 3/4 in. thick. one needs a sporty forearm/wrist to go with this watch. for the fun of wearing it couple times a year the price and just to look at it as part of a collection of watches i'd highly recommend it.

" i got this watch one week ago. its very good looking watch. its $85 but looks like $150+ watch. all of my friends are asking about this watch as it catches others eye very easily. it upper dial (having number 05-15-25 etc.) rotates clock wise; this is a functionality to keep the time accurate while fast driving. its bit heavy but now i am used to it. i would recomend this watch to everyone who like heavy looking watches on their wrist ",positive
" the earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find. my daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one. but that is no bash on the earrings the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment. i would definitely buy them again. ",positive
" i got these today and was so shocked when they arrived wow these are amazing hoops for 25 dollars. i am more than pleased don't have an idea what some of the other reviewers were complaining about i am floored at the price and the quality at the same time. with free shipping these are a must great gift idea and everyday earrings. amazon got them to me in a matter of 4 days and i'm in hawaii they also came beautifully packaged i'm in love with them don't let these sell out ",positive
" these were perfect the girl liked them they're the perfect size not very expensive great gift ",positive
" i sent these for my cousin (who has everything!)on her 16th birthday. when i saw them later they were smaller than i expected----but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated. they are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones. plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold--i would recommend these ",positive
" i have shopped with this company before and have never been disappointed. fast shipping and delivery reasonably priced and always what you expected ",positive
" this invicta 2699 watch it's a nice watch the case of stainless steel polished looks very well solid. with transparent case back although there is nothing exceptional to look at. dial of mother of pearl clear and clean with not too many words or other dials on it looks elegant the roman numbers are very good for that dial; the hands are big enough to be seen even in poor light conditions. the movement is a miyota automatic with 21 jewels works fine for the price. it has poor power reserve so if you do not use it for 24 hours it will stop nothing to worry about ",positive
" exactly what i wanted at a great price ",positive
" these have quickly become my favorite pair of earrings. they look substantial when worn but they are lightweight and comfortable. they go well with either silver or white gold necklaces. they are shiny and have a classic appearance. plus the snap bar locks them securely in place. buy them and you won't be sorry! they also make a great gift item ",positive
" i didn't expect the earrings to be so beautiful and they're really easy to wea ",positive
" silver insanity continues to produce gorgeous items of celtic jewellery. the drop hook earrings come with nice size faceted oval synthetic amethyst stones. very light weight. looks like you would pay 4-5 times the price. silver insanity just delivers time after time ",positive
" quality of leather looks nice. i can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off. it's metal squeazed to leather and that's what i expected. you just have to keep an eye on it and don't sleep or shower in it. it looks nice ",positive
" these are so beautiful. picture does not do them justice. gorgeous celtic knot design ",positive
" these earrings are very good quality sent to me quickly and in a jewelry bag. a very nice gift ",positive
" i was getting worried if it would arrive before my girlfriend went home for the holidays. then as promised it arrived today last day in the estimated delivery window. hey its christmas i understand shipping sucks this time of year but i still would have been angry if it was late. ok item itself looks great i love the chain that came with it. the box looks a little to cheesy on the outside to be romantic but the wrapping was high class enough to make up for the box. im sure my girlfriend will love this it will go great with her tattoo ",positive
" this necklace is well made very lovely. i am very pleased with the quality ",positive
" this is a great watch for a woman! i can't see it fitting a man and the watch face is too small for a man. i ordered it for my sister who has a large wrist and it is perfect for her ",positive
" my watch band was wider than the tool allowed so i used a milling machine to let it accept 1/8 more. ad should have stated how wide a band would work in this device. otherwise worked well ",positive
" tool works pretty well. product slightly different than picture not quite as good of quality as pictured. worked on several brands of watch bands. seller was prompt ",positive
" good product for a good price. this is an item u can't do without. would buy from vendor again ",positive
" i got it since two month ago and it looks cool. i like it. ",positive
" it is good and nice design. but it is little bit heavy. ",positive
" my husband had seen this watch advertised in a magazine and fell in love with it and had to have it. i searched at tommy stores large department stores and was not able to find it anywhere except amazon.com. the watch arrived as promised and my husband loves the watch. ",positive
" i need this bracelet for someone heading for the military... she would love it very much ",positive
" this quote became my all-time favorite the first time i read it. i was so delighted to find it on a piece of jewelry! i had it on my &quot;wish-list&quot; for over a year -- this year my husband finally took the hint and bought it for me! it's a beautiful piece is very comfortable and is made of quality silver. i highly recommend it for anyone who finds herself needing a boost of self-reliance throughout the day ",positive
" i have a disabled child and i got this as a gift from my husband and children. i look at it and i feel so greatful for the family i have. ",positive
" i have been suffering from depression since i was 15 years old. my mother bought this bracelet for me at the age of 21 as a surprise (after some hinting; i was patiently waiting to buy it on my own!) i must say it is one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts anyone has ever given to me. i don't believe i have taken it off for a single day in the several months i've owned it; it fits perfectly matches everything and its beautiful message keeps me more centered and hopeful. it also keeps me feeling close to my mother while i'm away at college. she doesn't know it yet but i hope to buy her the same bracelet for christmas. it's a simply amazing gift for yourself or someone else ",positive
" these were slightly smaller than i had hoped but they're pretty and they do the job ",positive
" excellent quality - the post is smooth and does not abrade the ear as some inexpensive earrings do. the ball is smooth and shiny with no ripples pits or other defects. i am very happy with this purchase ",positive
" the item has arrived in perfect timing. the earrings are good quality but not the best one ",positive
" i purchased these at $16 in december 2006; they are currently running for $15 which is so worth it for 14k white gold earrings. at this price you should be thinking about next year's christmas presents. otherwise if you are looking for a treat for yourself you will not be disappointed. the reason they lose a star with me is that for the 7mm size the earring backs should be larger; they are on the small side ",positive
" gave these to my wife as part of a birthday gidt and she loves them. she says they feel more comfortable than most stud-type and they look great ",positive
" these earrings are great. they are the perfect size. i would recommend these to anyone who likes a classic look. ",positive
" these earrings were a great value for the price! they're small and delicate enough to wear out but also look very polished for work. i would recommend them to any and everyone ",positive
" this is a great looking watch and i like that it is lightweight. i took it to the jeweler to have a few links removed. it's just techie enough for a geek like me (updates via satellite days of the week in several languages etc). enjoy. ",positive
" i was a little apprehensive about these waveceptor watches after reading reviews for them. common complaints included scratches on the face atomic synching problems and difficulty setting up the watch for the first time. i received my watch and it was in perfect condition no scratches light or otherwise. it is light but the construction feels solid. i was wondering what the initial setup was going to be like since others had claimed it had taken hours(!!!). it literally took me 15 seconds. it involves holding a button down for 5 seconds and pressing the other button a few times. once it was set up the watch immediately synched itself to my local time with no problems at all (i live in central florida.) i've only owned the watch for a day now and i must say i'm impressed with it so far. i haven't experienced any troubles mentioned in the other reviews and i'm very satisfied with my purchase. also i chose the super saver shipping amazon told me it'd take 3 weeks to get it to me. i received it in 4 days ",positive
" this watch is a high quality item for low money. you might think at first the color of the face is a little loud but you grow to like it and as most of you know if you have to grow to like something you like it for a longer time than something that just grabs you quickly. it keeps perfect time at all times as it is updated with a signal from fort collins colorado every night. i would definately reccommend this item/brand for anyone looking for a watch ",positive
" this is a great watch for my husband mike. he has wanted a watch that he didn't have to worry about changing the time on all the time. he travels often in his work. i also has a nice lighted face which is easy for him to read. getting older posses some vision problems so being able to read the time on your watch is a wonderful advantage. he also likes that it is on atomic time and energy ",positive
" in locker rooms and office corridors across this nations a battle rages for the souls of men. perhaps only the fratricidal dispute between boxers and briefs has more violently bloodied the masculine nose of our generation than this battle. yet the jury remains out: wallet or money clip what'll it be? lives and careers are savaged by a choice of one over the other yet the passion that drives guys in the direction of the traditonal leather wallet or - alternatively - to the minimalist money clip continues unabated. the titanium money clip scores a victory for the latter. small lightweight attractive it cleans a hip pocket out straightens the hang of the trouser and facilitates the quick snatch of a bill when the wallet guys are still sorting through receipt they carelessly shoved in with their banknotes. the only complaint regarding this product is that it requires five or six bills minimum before it has a sufficient wad to clasp firmly. other than that ... well ... i can't even remember where i tossed my wallet ",positive
" product matches expectations; no problems. some other customers complained about how lightweight it is. to me it seems like what you should expect from titanium (after all that's why they use it to make aircraft). the predictions of it getting sprung (losing its spring tension) were more of a legitimate concern to me but i've had it for a month or two and it seems fine. it seems no more likely to do that than any other money clip which is to say maybe it eventually will or maybe it won't them's the risks of life. go for it ",positive
" i purchased these earrings for my infant daughter. since most earrings are too large in my opinion for a 3 month old's ears this was the perfect solution. as my daughter likes to lie on me when taking a short nap the first earrings she had poked into me and it was uncomfortable for me. these are small enough not to bother me. the prongs do cover a bit more of the diamond than is shown in the pictures but they are still very cute. i also like the backs as they screw on to the posts and are nice and safe for baby's head ",positive
" i needed something to express how i felt in a way that few words would say exactly that and the yin yang necklace did it for me. ",positive
" i purchased this item as a present for my friend and i. the piece is beautiful and is a great gift for anyone. i myself have the yin half of the duo. the only problem is that the black paint in the yin half is easily washed away. now i don't mean that it all washes away but it does erode. the yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint however but i do worry about all of the paint eventually going away. other than that minor defect the necklaces are wonderfull. i'll definately be buying from this seller again ",positive
" it's a beautiful necklace and it was worth the cost. it's not filmsy or cheap it's durable and great ",positive
" the necklace arrived quickly especially considering that it came from thailand. good quality for a good price. thanks for good service. will be buying jewelry from this seller again ",positive
" this is a very pretty omega that goes well with many different pendants and looks great all by itself ",positive
" this was an inexpensive ring for a great price. it was a good buy for a hs niece who loves her celtic heritage and the color blue ",positive
" it was just what i wanted - i wear this ring on my pinky finger and it looks perfect. color clarity and triquetra pattern are striking ",positive
" i didn't realize how picky my taste is with rings until i scoured amazon for hours looking for something that would interest me. this ring is one of the few i found and i am far from a fan of having stones in my rings. it has a nice low profile. i've yet to have it catch on anything. i'm also not a fan of open knot work on rings but this again managed to sidestep that distaste. the stone has no backing so it gets an interesting red tinge in the middle tinted by my finger ",positive
" i read the reviews of the other buyers while i was purchasing ing this ring. the first review makes it sound mediocre while the other made it sound perfect. i promised myself i'd write a true review of the ring once i recieved my own. the stone is neither large nor gawdy. the silver pattern is slighty thick for my tastes however not noticably thick. the stone is not high nor fake looking. the picture gives an acurate display of the product. all in all it's a beautiful ring and a lovely buy for the price asked. ",positive
" i was concerned the stone would stick up too high on my finger instead it's the perfect height. i was concerned about ordering off the internet but i'm very pleased with the speed of service and the quality of the topaz is very good ",positive
" i'm quite happy with these and writing to say so because other users' comments were very helpful to me--especially the person who said that the earrings were substantial: i.e. though diminutive they have bulk so are visible with nice warm glow ",positive
" i bought these earrings for my 10-year old grandaughter for christmas. i think she has worn them everyday since - she loves them. they are not large hoops; if fact they are a bit small -- but perfect for her. for an adult i think a little bit larger size would be better. all in all i was very pleased with the earrings; the quality is very good. ",positive
" when i first ordered these i wasnt expecting anything of high quality since their price was so low. it was more of a side gift for my girlfriend. but upon recieving i was taken back at how nice they really look. you cant pass these up for the price. shipping was very fast too. ",positive
" this cute little watch comes with a real eye patch. my son loved it because he also wears an eye patch for his crossed eye ",positive
" this was a stocking stuffer for christmas. my grandson loved it and it is performing well ",positive
" this is so cute and if you are a pig collector you need to add him to your collection. the blue eyes and rhinestone ears are what make it. nice pink color not too bright or too dull and so small it's cute. the little compartment can fit a few rings or earrings in it. very very nice ",positive
" don't let the price of this cat necklace make you think it is tiny and almost invisible!! it is a very good size and the carving is great! it was so inexpensive that i bought two of them. i'm thinking i might give one to my fellow cat lover friend! great item with a great price! ",positive
" i bought this item for my grandaughter whose birthday is in august. i think she will like it a lot. i know i did ",positive
" i was impressed with the quality and detail of the ring. the person i bought it for loves it and as a jeweler herself that says alot. i was afraid of the metals when i bought it but she has had no problems. overall the ring is a gorgeous imitation of history and i would highly recommend it and the company i bought it from ",positive
" it is what he wanted and you provided it for him thanks i made points as a good grandmother ",positive
" this is a very grown up looking watch and my son who is seven loved it but it bothered him that it didn't fit very well. the velcro part didn't go very far so it was too big and we ended up putting this one away for maybe next year and buying another timex that was easier to adjust which worked pretty well by the way. ",positive
" we bought this watch for my 8-year old-- who loves it. we deliberately wanted him to develop his time-telling skills (i.e. no digital watches please!) and have a cool watch too. the velcro strap the second hand water-resistant qualities (i can wear it in the shower mom!) and the indiglo face (very cool in movie theaters) made this a great buy. ",positive
" very well satisfied . it's great for a kid to learn to tell timeand the design with velcro strap makes it very adjustable ",positive
" i bought this as a holiday gift - they're a nice size clear stones with good purple color. i'm very pleased with my purchase particularly considering the price. if i were to change one thing i'd have preferred larger backs and a sturdier post ",positive
" my friend loved the watch and helped to bring her out of a bad mood ",positive
" the watch is very colorful. it is even safe to wear in the shower. however the watch cannot be read in the dark and the hands are even hard to see in daylight. it takes an extra few seconds to figure out wear the hands are. but adults who can't get enough of harry should consider this watch ",positive
" it's a good value for money -- too rough on the edges ",positive
" i have no problem with the watch. i actually bought it for my son in law. he seems happy with it. it updates the time and date almost every night he says. even though it keeps very good time without an up date. ",positive
" my husband likes watches and is a bit of a geek so this was the perfect christmas gift for him. i was a little bit apprehensive when i recieved it but it works just like it should. it is not apparent from the discription but this watch does have the date feature. i couldn't have gotten him a better gift for the price he wears it every day ",positive
" i bought this watch two months back and am using it as a casual watch. but it would go with a formal dress even. works as promised; i have tried synching this watch in two countries three signalling stations and several time zones and it works perfectly well. to quote the cons it is a bit chunky but that's ok since i'm using it as a casual watch. the back of the watch is plastic which makes it look cheap but don't know if there is any specific reason for that. also it would've gratified my every needs had there been an 'indiglo' or 'nightglo' feature. in complete darkness the irradiating hands look fine but if it is half light then i have to spend a second or two searching for the hands. these are minor things and i am a perfectionist so here i stamp 4 stars on it. ",positive
" works like advertised. syncs well with atomic time from colorado (i am in california). looks nice. ",positive
" i bought this as a gift for my husband. he loves it it works great looks great and the price was awesome! the bragging points of this watch are that the face is large the numbers are easily readable it keeps great time because it is atomic and the hands and numbers glow in the dark for nighttime viewing. the model we bought had a metal-link silver band and i wish i could have bought the plastic/leather band but it was not available at the time. the silver band looks great and my husband liked it but for work he has to have a non-metal band. we replaced the band with a plastic/rubber one and the watch is still looking great and my husband can use it for work or dressy situations! i can't believe the great price we got this watch for. it is really a perfect watch for men. ",positive
" (...) the watch has a nice weight beautiful face and is generously sized. i need to have several links removed before i can wear it. it comes nicely packaged although at first i didn't think that instructions and warranty paperwork were included. they were hidden inside the top of the watch box. it was difficult at first to pull out the pin in order to set the time but once i got the pin out it was a snap to adjust the date and time. all in all an excellent watch for a great price! ",positive
" i've only had this watch for about a week so can't really comment about the long term durability. however it is ultra cool watch. although i've not got a scale handy at the moment but it seems to be lighter than my ipod nano. really a featherweight watch and therefore very comfortable to wear. the dial color really can't be adaquately captured in a picture. it is very attractive much more striking than the image indicates. several people have asked where i purchased it. i'm very happy with this choice ",positive
" this skagen watch is full of class yet it's perfect for casual wear too. very thin so it's not clunky like a lot of other watches. titanium black... and the band is black metal as well. had to bend the clasp a bit to get it to hold but now it's perfect. and because it's not an expansion braclet it's very easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist. i hope to have this for years to come because i've not seen anything like it. and the price is right too ",positive
" this watch is so light and thin but so good-looking that even my husband who doesn't like watches weighing him down wears it every day. after three months i don't see any wearing away of the band and the face seems to really resist scratching because it still looks perfect ",positive
" the watch is everything i hoped for except i wish the blue dial was a little brighter blue. handsome as is just not impressive or eye catching. other than that minor complaint it is very slim and very comfortable to wear. you don't even feel it on your arm ",positive
" don't buy this watch unless you want it (and your good taste) to be admired. it's just beautiful sort of like man-jewelry for guys that don't wear jewelry. but i plan to wear it only when i wear certain clothing to certain events. i have other watches for other situations ",positive
" i loved this watch the moment i put it on at macy's. i get home to see if i could maybe get a better deal than $135. as always amazon comes through yet again with a price of $69 plus i don't pay sales tax on it. sold! if you've not seen this watch in person the pictures definitely do not do it justice ",positive
" this watch is for occasions only. you wear this one to weddings dance parties and or formal occassions. 1 you don't bring this to a fishing camp or use it climbing a rock face. 2 it's not a chonographic face so not for military so its not roughed enough to take out into the wilderness to go romping through with your m2a1 rifles. its sole perpuse is to get stares and look pretty on occasions like birthday events. let your girlfriends buy it for you guys. i bought it because it was titanium mesh not because of it's latching method. again its almost 18th century... it's 21 century material used in place of a 18th century design ",positive
" great looking watch... looks just like the photo if not better. very pleased with the quality and for a very affordable price ",positive
" i had been looking at the skagen watches for six months and could not find any sales. they are priced around $110. when i saw this particular model for $69 i was excited. i read some other reviews on other watches and was cautious when some said that they purchased watches that were not in boxes and had no instructions. this watch arrived three days after i ordered it and was in a beautiful box just like i had bought at the store. it was brand new and i love it. i especially love it when i get something new on sale and a great deal. amazon is a great place to order. i get merchandise very quickly and at a great price ",positive
" this necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift. she wears it everyday with every outfit. it looks great with jeans and a t-shirt and with an extravagent dress. ",positive
" this is a perfect anytime gift. i bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it. we have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top. perfect for any occasion. she'll love it. this will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anything plus it's under 100. can't beat the price. thanks amazon ",positive
" i wore the phoenix necklace at my first trip to the magic castle where i got compliments from the waiter and some of the magician ",positive
" i came across this looking for angel pendants. i bought this one and the matching earrings. i absolutely love this pendant! wear it all the time and always get compliments on it. you can wear it year round! one of the earrings fell out of my ear the first time i wore it! wouldn't recommend those! but this winged pendants is beautiful ",positive
" i was pleased with this item. my only criticism is that it is smaller than it appears in the pictures so i was decieved. i was hoping for a larger pendant.. however my wife really likes it and it came with a nice little velvetine bag in which to store it.... ",positive
" i love this pendant every time i wear it people want to know where i got it back in the 70's we bought items that reminded us of the eagles and lynn skynn's free bird. so when i wear it it reminds me of the good old days. yeah i know it's a pheonix but whn i bought it was called an eagle.(ebay ",positive
" i had the pendant in 3 days insted of 3 weeks! and that from the us to the netherlands. many thanks for that. the pendant itself is perfect very detaild and it looks great. ",positive
" my girls love them. the face of the watch is clear and easy to see. they also like that it lights up ",positive
" these watches are just as cute as they look in the ad. this is 1 of 3 i bought for christmas. all 3 girls really like them. no one has had any trouble with them ",positive
" i had an issue with my ring not being delivered in a timely matter. i got in touch with the company and they had a new one delivered to me the next day. the person i dealt with was very professional and i would definitely buy from this company again ",positive
" i bought this for my wife for valentines day and she was elated. she said they were the perfect size and weight. when she's happy i'm happy ",positive
" these earrings are perfect! perfect in size color and weight. they're not much bigger then a quater and very light in a beautiful white gold shine. yes the post are thicker then most but after a few days you get use to them. i had a pair like these that were given to me as a gift and i lost one. when i found these on amazon i wasn't sure how much they would be like my other. they are a perfect match and my old pair was at least 7-8 years old. if you want a perfect hoop that is good for day or night these are the ones ",positive
" i was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick. however i think it's a decent buy for only $30.00 i bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend. it comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch. very clean presentation when you open it up. the white gold really shines. the free shipping was fast...and i do mean quick. i ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day. i've never had a quicker shipment for free before. if your looking for a great deal on white gold earings i think you've found it ",positive
" the picture for this pendant is deceiving; it is a lot smaller than it appears. i know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is. nevertheless my wife likes it very much and that's good enough for me. the price was right at $18.00 so overall i think it was a good buy. ",positive
" being part irish and born 3 days after st patricks day hence my name i was lucky enough to find this item at amazon.com and it is a top class item with a good finish. the ring seems to keep it's shine with no maintanence required. as usual the service and delivery at amazon.com is second to none. as an american living in australia there are so many things i can't get in this country which is why i get things like jewelry from them. couldn't be happier with this ring ",positive
" my cousin is pleased with this gift and began wearing as soon as she got it ",positive
" i bought these for my sister for christmas and she absolutlely loved them ",positive
" i was pleased when i received my earrings however they're smaller in reality than what's pictured on the website.but they're still pretty ",positive
" very lovely for a good price and came less then a week after i ordered it with standard mail. was very impresse ",positive
" jewelry&watches live well... you'll be always in a high spirit if you purchase this bracelet. it's a really good gift for your friends ",positive
" the bracelet looks more expensive than it is. i like wearing it ",positive
" although i've only had it a few weeks i have had many compliments and questions on where i got it. it is detailed and solid with a great message. would recommend it ",positive
" loving the look of the rolex daytona i spotted this watch on amazon and just had to have one (at the price). arrived in a well padded display box with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic - so no scratches. taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes. the watch looks great - better than the images on the web - and it works as described. other posters that have had issues should read the manual! it does all of the chrono functions and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc. - fantastic ",positive
" the watch looks and feels great. i did a lot of looking around before i decided on this watch and i'm very happy with my choice! i would recommend this watch to anyone who is in the market for a very good watch at an even better price. well done invicta and amazon on a great product ",positive
" i sent this watch to my five-year old grandson as his birthday gift. he was very proud wearing it because the second hand had a soccer ball on it and the strap did not need adjusting. besides he started playing soccer at that time. ",positive
" i am not much for this watch but it is exactly what i paid for. i knew it wasn't going to excite me becasue it's a kids watch. it's ok for a kids watch ",positive
" i am the type of person who has to have a watch on; i feel lost without it. therefore my watch has to be something that i can wear every day. but i also wanted something that can go with a dressier outfit. and this watch is wonderful. i've heard that skagen is a good brand and it's true. it's very lightweight beautiful (i love the little crystals at each number) and durable. great buy ",positive
" - price point was excellent - product quality is really good - shipped on time - was priced 50% compared to dillard's locally and no taxes no shipping fees: ",positive
" i bought this for almost 50% less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase. the only trouble i have had is with the clasp. it is a little tricky and you have to make sure that is catches correctly. i found my watch on the floor recently because the clasp came open ",positive
" it's not the most expensive watch but it doesn't have to be. it's a looker of a watch. classyclean and sharp looking. mesh band on the wrist (any- i have a skagen also) is most comfortable and easy to use and sure locking. terrific buy & price ",positive
" the watch is extremely reliable. i've had it three years and it's never lost time and is running on the original battery. i wear it every day so it takes a lot of abuse. it's simple design is elegant enough for me to wear to work or out for a casual evening but casual enough for me to wear on weekends. the mesh band is the most comfortable band you will ever wear you don't even feel it against your skin. i have a two-tone movado and i far prefer my $89 skagen to my $900 movado. my skagen is also easy to read the time. i just love it more than i can say. i own numerous watches many from switzerland. but the skagen is the king of my lifetime watch collection. simplicity as its very best ",positive
" this watch is great looks great and feels great. the hands clicking sound is almost none! overall nice watch very happy with it. ",positive
" i've purchased this watch from mid-watch company- as you can see it's a fab casual watch and is worth the price. the service was great and on time and i am very pleased with this purchase. thank you ",positive
" the learning curve on this watch if you use it for fishing may take some time. the moon phase is nice to know about and the sunrise and sunset is pretty cool too but i didn't give this watch 5 stars because for the money it didn't give me the one option i used more than any other on previous cheaper watches a timer. this one has the stopwatch but there is no timer you can set for say 10 or 15 minutes. it keeps great time so far but that's typical of casio. the backlight is very bright enough so that you can almost use it as a flashlight and the option on this model where you can set it for the backlight to come on everytime you hold your arm a certain way is cool. if you're looking for a good water proof timepiece and you don't really care about the timer issue this is the one. and yeah i'm vain about what it looks like on my arm; it looks manly and cool ",positive
" my son loves his new timex watch. it has an elastic band that is easy for him to slip on and off. he wears it every day and he is getting so much better at telling time! if you push a button the face lights up. my son enjoys using this to tell time in the dark ",positive
" i bought this for my boyfriend. he absolutely loves this product. it holds his money in the clipper and his credit cards on the opposite side. it's beautiful silver and looks very professional. ",positive

" the fossil watch bentley gunmetal it is an excellent purchase because it is a watch of high quality and to a good price. if they want to have a quality watch and that it likes the people who know they do not doubt in buying it ",positive
" apart of great look and seem durability it is strange feature in such kind of dial. you have chronograph but you do not have idea where it stops. 23 or 26 seconds? difficult to find out with such a dial.. ",positive
" i really like this watch. looks nice and has all the features i wanted ",positive
" i received this watch from santa and boy did he do a good job. i love it! it is a very nice watch and it has handle the russle and tussle of a single-mom's life without much marks. can't beat the price. ",positive
" even if you are not buy this watch. i am a nurse much like many of the other reviewers. in fact i bought it due to their reviews. it is a fantastic watch. easy to read has an illumination option and a handy date feature. the only trouble i have is the size of the band (too long). i will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out however the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy (it's not). don't even bother looking for another watch this one is a steal ",positive
" the wife has a hard time with watches and this one has made her very happy ",positive
" i was a little surprised at the size and weight of this watch its almost 0.5in thick and the bezel is a full 1.5in across so the case is a bit bigger than that. the mineral glass crystal seems substantial and durable but the clarity is just average. in addition to having glow-in-the-dark markings (which don't work too well) on the hands and dial-markers it also has an indiglo style back-light (which does work well). the bezel only rotates counter-clockwise and it seems very tight at first. overall it's a decent everyday watch. ",positive
" the styling on this watch is very nice. the silver and the grey colors look really good. the lightweight titanium is great and the size is just right. now for what i don't like about it...first after purchasing online i took it to a jewelry store to have a couple of links taken out...i'm out $15 for that. the the clasp pin has broken twice another $20 for repair. and the watch is loud. when i'm driving to work or am sitting in the office and everything is quiet i can hear the ticking....i don't guess that should bother me..but it does ",positive
" the watch is very lightwieght and is scratch resistant so far! i wear it at work everyday and its holding up great! enjoy the watch and always buy from amazon ",positive
" i bought this watch because i wanted something inexpensive but still professional looking. i like the lightness of the watch the thin size and the simple design. it does make an audible ticking sound that is louder than i would like but still not very noticeable. if you haven't seen other comments about getting the watch sized pay attention. i took it to a professional jewelry repair shop and they still couldn't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches. i would recommend having any size adjustments done by a professional jeweler who has been selling this brand of watch for a while. the jeweler i went to has a good reputation but does not sell skagen. ",positive
" exceptional value in a classy and understated design. keeps time in a superior fashion highly recommended ",positive
" the casio g-shock atomic solar watch #gw1400da-4av is sort of middle of the road in terms of price (i paid $99). it's not cheap but it's not too expensive either. the display diameter is not large but it is a thick tough-looking watch (a real man's watch... :) ). it's also on the heavy side. so if you're looking for an elegant thin watch look somewhere else. when i first got it the power source was at 50% charge. after leaving the watch on my desk facing up towards a desk fluorescent lamp that was left on the charge reached 100% the next day. the solar cell seems to be working. the time is accurate too. i checked it against the computer time (which also gets synched everyday). it comes with a small manual (with very small text) but i found that there's really no need to use the manual at all initially. it works right out of the box and all the factory settings were correct. (the manual will come in useful when you have some time on your hands to browse through it to get a clearer idea of all the available features.) the watch's steel wristband was much too large for me and i had to shorten it (removed 4 links actually). i used a swiss army knife blade to accomplish the task. the knife tip has to be strong enough to apply pressure to the spring loaded rod that holds the links together but small to get into the small area between the wrist band metal links (watch for the arrows: these tell you where to apply the pressure). you need to push down on the ridges of the rod and out (away from you). (down so that you can make the rod shorter and out so that when the rod is shortened the wrist band link will pop out). i did accidentally scratch the band but it wasn't too bad since the scratch was on the inside. (it's easy enough to shorten the wristband and almost everyone who gets this watch will have to do this.) be careful not to slice your finger open. always turn the blade away from your finger when applying the pressure. overall i give it 2 thumbs up for looks and functionality. (note: this watch is sold by multiple vendors on amazon. you should check for the one that has the best price. when i bought it i wasn't aware of this but found out later a little too late) ",positive
" as other people have pointed out this is a very solid watch. i really am not afraid of it breaking if it falls or anything like that. however this is partly due to its enormous thickness. it's not that the diameter of the watch is surprisingly large - it's how thick it is. if you have a small wrist this watch is probably not for you as it will be very noticeable. it's also not especially light obviously but it feels comfortable enough. it keeps excellent time and i've had no problems with the automatic signal searching ",positive
" this watch is great. it recharges itself self adjusts with the atomic clock world time auto lighting etc... just to mention a few features. as this is from the g shock series it is really sturdy and scratch/water/weather/heat/shock resistant! it has both the digital and the analog hand to view the time(whichever is convenient). this synchronizes with the atomic clock(time and the daylight savings) which means you need not adjust the time. another interesting feature is that if you tilt your hand in the dark towards you then the watch lights up showing you the time! there are a few cons. there is no seconds hand on it(but there is a digital second indicator). this watch is slightly heavy and huge. but after a few months you get adjusted to it. you need to go through the manual as there are so many features and you have only four buttons ",positive
" this is a very nice affordable watch. i like not having to replace batteries and knowing that it will always be accurate. people who own $1000+ watches ask me about it a lot. when i tell them that it is solar powered and automatically synchronizes with an atomic clock every night and that i only paid $60 for it while on sale from amazon they immediately tell me that they paid too much for their expensive inferior watches ",positive
" it's a very stylish watch and i get compliments on it all the time but the display for the functions like stopwatch alarm and date display are small and hard to see. also the date is off and i haven't been able to properly set it ",positive
" i bought this watch as a gift for a friend who requested this exact one. he loves it. personally the lights that come on and off far too frequently for no reason would be a little too much for me. it is certainly the largest wrist watch i have come across but if this is what you're looking for and knowing that it is a g-shock which makes it a great watch this is the one for you ",positive
" this watch does a lot in a large light case. i was impressed when it set itself during the recent time change. very nice ",positive
" the watch is an excellent timekeeper. automatic calibration really works (although some reviews i'd read indicate otherwise). i like the dial features (changes to dst calendar knows how many days in a monthetc.) do not though travel with this watch for a while without the instruction book. the four control buttons take some time to figure out and most of them are so rarely used that when you do need the stopwatch or one of the various other options you'll likely need the book (at least i did). also understand that this is a big watch--probably at least twice as thick as the watch you're used to and considerably heavier. it will hang up on a jacket or anything with long sleeves. the g shock though is tougher than a hammer and if you don't mind the bulk i'd recommend it. rlm in iow ",positive

" i've seen very inconsistant reviews for silver insanity items. i received this necklace for christmas last year and it's pretty nice. generally i always receive a compliment when i wear it. for the price it's worth it. if you're looking for something nicer you're simply going to have to pay more ",positive
" i own many watches including some very expensive ones. such quality & looks for 1/10 of the price ! this watch is classy and the quality is second to none. awesome ! ",positive
" i bought this watch for my husband and he absolutely loves it. he has received many compliments. it is high quality and arrived in perfect condition. it is great as an everyday watch and still nice enough to wear for dressier occasions as well. almost bought the watch at a dept. store but saved $25 using amazon. great product! ",positive
" i recieved this watch for christmas and i'm still blown away looking at it. had to take it to a jewelry shop to remove a link (my wrists are small) because the links are difficult to do themselves but that's probably just for emphasis on quality. it came in a fossil christmas tin very well packaged. i'm very satisfied and recommend it for someone looking for a nice dress watch for their collection ",positive

" recently i got into a more grown up field (commercial real estate) and decided i had to look the part. i decided i needed a great watch to go with those new brooks brothers suits and got an invicta speedway. at over a little more than a hundred bucks it was the greatest deal of my life. i get compliments on it especially from women almost every single day. several of my older colleagues mistook it for a rolex daytona and flipped when i told them the price. i highly recommend it. furthormore i have found that invicta is an amazing watch company to say the least. around the same time i also bought the 8926 pro diver to use as my casual watch and also get endless compliments. it is amazing that i got both of these watches for less money than a run of the mill seiko or citizen. they will have have my money and compliments for years to come ",positive
" it's a great watch for the price. i think i paid $130 for it. it runs great keeps good time and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money. high quality work very close in look/feel/weight to a r*lex. we'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time but other than that it's a great watch ",positive
" has the effect of thousends $$$$ watch. i love it. one of the best deals i`ve had from amazon this last years ",positive
" believe it this is a stunningly beautiful watch and no one will guess the price unless you tell them. it gets more attention than my gold rolex! as for the weight it is normal for stainless which means a solid feel and you know it's there. if someone wants a flyweight watch why would they buy stainless steel? it reliably functions exactly as described. you'll love this watch. buy the 5-year extended warranty for $25 and enjoy it. p.s. if you need to remove links just put a smoothed paperclip in a vice to push the pins out. no big deal ",positive
" the watch was even more attractive than it appeared. i had none of the noise problems that were described in other reviews. the mesh bracelet is not as comfortable as the leather bands i am used to. in low light it is sometimes difficult to see (my eyesight is good). but basically i am very satisfied ",positive
" received this watch in timely manner very pleasantly surprised at feeling of weight solid construction and ruggedness. had about given up at getting a watch with digital dial that was not a casio plastic watch. have recently bought the soloman stainless version and a gold vestal model. will let my relatives choose which watch suits them as a gift. gene setchell ",positive

" i read the reviews on this diamond just before christmas when it was on sale for $99.00. the diamonds are better then expected and i consider them to be a fine purchase for 99 bucks. no visible flaws. i am sure if i used a loop i could find some but no visible yellow on these and the clarity is fair. their great for $99.00 diamonds ",positive
" this one is excellent for the price. good build and accurate. i wish it had alert function ",positive
" my friends purchased this watch for me in 1998 as a graduating college/leaving for the army gift. i have worn it daily for nine years. it survived the hardships of an army lifestyle (i wore it daily then too) and is still going strong. i have replaced the battery once and had to have the date bezel removed (the thin silver border) because it popped out after my toddler daughter beat on it on the ground various times (yes i should have moved it to a higher location). the lens has minor scratches but nothing that deters from its simple function and aesthetic charm. this watch has never failed me. it is simply the best most durable watch that i have ever owned ",positive
" very handsome easy-to-read face and date window; especially like the day/date display. most watches in this price range feature date only. excellent value ",positive
" i got this set as a party gift for a sleep-over for my kids. they loved it and the price was really hard to beat ",positive
" the dial is big for some people but being it's a diving watch i would expect nothing less. this is a beautiful piece of machinery and i wear it everyday ",positive
" i'm a pretty big guy so it doesn't look out of place but this is really an extra large watch that is also quite heavy. it runs well keeps good time and the movement has a very good reputation for reliability. if you're an extra large person and don't mind a heavy watch you may be interested in this. if you're average size or smaller i wouldn't recommend it. personally this is my weekend watch because it comes across as being pretty bullet-proof in normal use ",positive
" i like this watch it's good price and also cool look ;) hey guys you will not lose anythings if you have one like it : ",positive
" yeah it's a money clip alright. going from an overfilled wallet down to a 5 card/cash only clip was surprisingly easy. i found that i was carrying a whole lot of stuff in my wallet that i didn't need and was just causing my wallet to get bigger and bigger. with just 5 cards a couple receipts and a little cash this clip is much more comfortable easier to manage and looks a lot better than my old wallet. i do agree with the previous reviewer about the clip forcing the cash to bunch up under the clasp when it's closed. however it doesn't take long for it to become second nature to keep the cash pulled out a bit before securing it down. i haven't used any other money clips so i can't compare this one to others but if you use a wallet i can say that this is hands down my new preference ",positive
" i've had this for a week it may not function as well in a year and that is something you might want to keep in mind reading this. so far however it's been a great replacement for a wallet. don't get me wrong i still have my wallet and will likely use it when travelling. but for everyday use this is far more practical and comfortable to carry. it's also as easy on the eyes as it is in the pocket - equally pleasant to carry and look at. feels sturdy and durable; light but not flimsy. this can hold upto 5 cards and maybe 20 bill notes. be warned however although the clip does hold 5 credit card-sized cards (id's and whatever else you may have) it is only really easy to remove the topmost and bottom most cards. that is if you have 5 cards you use quite often you may want to look else where. personally i have an id on the top and my credit card on the bottom. the other three cards are ones i almost never use or use very rarely. one of the concerns i had purchasing this is whether or not it will securly hold less than 5 cards. it does (there are pressure clips on the sides of where the card goes in) but i wouldn't recommend it. just didn't feel safe enough even with 4 cards. something i did not foresee purchasing this is that the clip secures the money very tightly. consequently: 1) when you press down the clip it drags the money back a few millimeters. if you put the money in too far back it'll crumple it up. 2) when secured you can't just pull out a bill you will have to lift the clip up. the first point i've found a little more bothersome than the second but after playing around with it for half an hour or so i've got the hang of clamping it without crumpling the money. that being said it really is a very nice item and would be an awesome gift to give to a friend husband father or for your own personal use - if it suites their or your dress style. (if you are wondering why it is a 4 star and not a 5... well for no real good reason. it does deserve 5 stars but the little issues with the clip tugging on the money as you clamp it down - although it means money is held more securely - that holding less than 5 cards didn't feel too secure and pulling out any card other than the top and bottom most cards is difficult dropped it down to a 4. it may just be that these are issues that were neccessary to keep the product as fanatastic as it is. 4.5 stars might have been a welcome option this is as close to perfect as it gets.

" the ring is better in real life than the picture but you still get what you pay for. ",positive
" this pendant is really nice. i bought it as a gift. it is just the pendant so you do have to get a chain. ",positive
" they are comfy and i am able to wear them for long periods of time where with some other metals i can not. the thing is i have smaller ears than some people so the stones are a little big for my ears i think but other than that they are just fine ",positive
" i just recently had my ears pierced and needed something small that i could wear continually on a daily casual basis without the earrings looking too dressy. these earrings are just perfect for that purpose. they are simple elegance with genuine pearls and sterling silver findings. they are even confortable enough to wear while sleeping. i am wearing the white pearl set right now. love them! ",positive
" i love these! they are such a good deal for the price and come in a nice box. they are much better than what i was expecting. : ) colours are a nice pastel and would go with lots of different things. pearls are large but not too large - just right ",positive
" we happened across these as a gold box item and decided they were the perfect size and color for our daughter as an easter present. they came nicely packaged and are some of her favorites. my wife now wants the same in different colors : ",positive
" all right so these earrings are absolutely adorable! they are fun and go with anything! good size. good quality. i would buy for someone as a gift ",positive
" these earrings are really pretty. there are not real great variations in the color between each set (they are all pastel after all!) but each has a beautiful sheen and color. they are also set very firmly on the backs - i was worried that for the price they wouldn't hold up. but they are very nicely made. the packaging was okay but not deluxe. what i appreciated was that there was a little flyer enclosed telling how to take care of pearls which i found informative. all in all a good purchase and well worth the money ",positive
" i am very pleased with the pretty shades of the pearls and the size was even bigger than i expected. the only thing that would have them even better was bigger flat backings. i have very small ear lobes so they flopped forward. i remedied that by changing the backings. i am wearing them with so many things and really enjoying them ",positive
" as with all natural pearls the shapes are not perfect. only cultured pearls are perfect because man controls them. the dye is uniform and the size is perfect big enough that they can be seen easily. the colors; pink white gold and lavender are clear. even the green is a clear green just not my favorite green ",positive
" i was skeptical about this watch because of the very low price but i was very pleasantly surprised. it has a quality finish and band is comfortable and works great here on the east coast. it reliably synchs with the colorado time signal so it's always accurate. great watch for the money i highly recommend this yellow dial watch and its black and blue dial siblings ",positive
" i purchased one of the casio men's atomic waveceptor yellow dial watch #vq200hda-9bvcf from amazon. this watch is great it updates the time automatically (just switched to daylight savings and i didn't have to touch a thing).instructions say to position watch in a window or where it has view to the sky for updates my watch was in a drawer under a marble top and it updated just fine.i saw in other reviews complaints about the plastic back this is a must to allow the auto updates. again cool lookinggreat watch!!!! ",positive
" this watch is pretty much exactly what you would expect from the picture. the case is a bit thick and the backplate is plastic but that might reduce overall weight and compensate for the size. it certainly doesn't feel like the lead weight my fossil watches seem to be. i have a smaller than average wrist and it was easily sizable down with the proper tools. atomic time reception is good even as far south as i am and it rarely misses updates. you can force an update if you feel like it and its really easy. what is not easy is the initial setup. i've never had to really read a manual on most electronics but you will need it with this one. keep that in a safe place for when the battery dies. at least for now the price is a deal for the functionality and quality ",positive
" it is a nice watch for the dollar spent on this item. the catch is that it will work with the concept of wave-ceptor. and it adjusts time according to the place you are in. so...good watch..! ",positive

" i just bought this pin to put in my hair for my upcoming wedding i love it! it's really sparkly and gorgeous. i also accidentally dropped it on tile flooring and it didn't break. very nice pin ",positive
" first impressions: it's a nice watch with a clear look. i was a little worried about the lack of backlighting but was pleasantly suprised that i was able to see the luminescent dials clearly at any hour of the night. pros: quick atomic time synchronization (usually within one to two minutes after the initial synchronization). simple to use. cons: case is described as stainless steel but back piece is plastic. originally listed by amazon as a solar-powered watch but instead powered by regular battery. battery life expectancy about 2 years though it may lost longer by disabling the auto-sync feature. overall comments: this is my first atomic time wrist-watch. it automatically synchronizes with atomic time once at midnight (a function you can disable if desired) or on-demand with the press of a button or two. it does this by scanning for a radio signal. according to the instructions you're supposed to leave this watch near a window with the 6-o'clock side facing the window for best radio-signal reception. reception can of course vary depending on your location but the watch has successfully updated several times even while i was wearing it. i like watches with flat crystal surfaces because it allows me to paste a pda screen-proctector (cut to size of course) on them which keeps the crystal from scratching. the crystal on this watch is only slightly curved and in only one direction meaning a screen protector sticks nicely and evenly to it. the watch is waterproof to 50 meters which (in casio terms) means you can go swimming with it but you should not press any buttons underwater. i try to keep my watches away from water when i can but it's always good to know that it should survive most water-related mishaps ",positive

" lovely jewelry great price but the clasp is pretty tough to work. this is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers. i'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert-key type clasp. it's probably a great choice for very occassional use though with the quality and price it really is a regular-use type of necklace. i think it's best suited for the nimble-fingered traditional-fashion person ",positive

" if you are trying to buy a decent set of pearls and don't really have a good frame of referance - these are for you. my wife was a jewler and she likes pearls. i bought these and got positive feedback. i was nervous but when they showed they were heavy and looked great. you will be ok if you go with these ",positive

" this watch comes in a cute box which shows what's inside. the contents are nicely spread out and the presentation is certainly appealling to the eyes of a little girl. excellent product ",positive
" i ordered this jewelry piece with the gift box and card. the box while attractive at first glance is flimsy got slightly crushed in transit and the ribbon on its top is frayed and pasted-on. the card that came with it is much too large to fit inside the box or even on top gracefully and the message inside is not centered making it impossible to trim down. said message inside appears to have been written in plain old times new roman script. i could do far better on my own printer and for the cost i could get a much more attractive card at a store. i will say however that the piece itself looks every bit as nice as it does in the photos. i might order from silver insanity again but i'm not paying for any of the frills- they just aren't putting enough work into it to make it worth it ",positive
" these are beautiful earrings. they are a bit small but the stones are vibrant and rich looking. my only complaint is that the post part of the earring is not very substantial and i feel as though i need to handle them very carefully. they are extremely comfortable and have just the right amount of movement to them.

" i received these earrings today and am delighted with them. i read the reviews carefully so i knew the actual size of this item and the only surprise was how exquisite these little earrings are. the presentation (bag and box) is beautiful -- looks like materials you would be given in a traditional jewelry store. i've posted a couple photos in customer images so you can better visualize the size and see what the earrings are housed in ",positive
" paid $45 for these and worth every penny. they are delicate the color is brilliant the stones are very clear. i wore them to work as soon as i got them and received more than a few compliments on them. they would make a wonderful gift for someone and even better for yourself ",positive
" they are beautiful and delicate. i just love the way they sparkle. thanks amazon ",positive

" another nice inexpensive tool that makes tedious work go much faster and easier ",positive
" the bracelet didn't look as i expected from looking at the picture but is very pretty. i didn't realize it would be so delicate-looking because there is nothing to compare it to in the image. it is very nice though. it is small/thin the kind of thing you might wear with a dress yet seems strong. the metalwork seems done well and i think it's a bracelet that would be right for wearing someplace special ",positive
" the watch is just as discribed. it is heavy and large. the person i bought it for had to get several links removed. it would be great for a larger man ",positive
" it's a fantastic watch. a little heavy and bit of work is required to adjust the band. overall the nice blue background stands out quite nicely. it's on the money with keeping time too ",positive

" i bought this for my sister for christmas. i have a similar one that is bigger that i bought while in charleston sc. she fell in love with mine and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question i decided on this one. at first when it arrived i thought it would be too small but my sister does not wear large neclaces earrings etc... turns out she loved it. it was just perfect for her especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive ",positive
" the 18 description is for the necklace on it's longest extended setting. without using the extended part of the chain it is really closer to being child sized. it is pretty and will end up being a gift for my daughter rather than the friend i had intended to give it to ",positive
" i bought this for a 2006 christmas gift and i am very pleased. i know my daughter will be too. it comes in a pretty purple velvet bag a nice box with cotton and includes instructions on how to keep it nice. i got it at a great discount at one of the friday sales ",positive
" i am 89 years old and i love this necklace! whoever said old ladies can not wear fashion things are nuts! i wear this with everything......... from my fridayy night bingo nights to clubing in l.a with lindsey and pari ",positive
" i received this pair of hoop earrings as a christmas gift from my boyfriend. when i first open the box i thought they were earrings for an infant. the earrings are very very small; however they are cute. as i started wearing the earrings i began to really like them. they are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession. if you really like dainty jewelry i highly recommend this item ",positive
" i received this watch yesterday and would like to counter some comments in other reviews. the watch i received has no scratches on the crystal. it was packaged nicely. it does not seem too thick. it does not appear cheap or lightweight. although the back plate and two buttons are plastic the rest of the watch is sturdy metal and it feels solid. the wristband is just the right size for me although i do have a gorilla wrist. i didn't find the manual difficult to understand. the watch attempted to auto-sync overnight but didn't get a signal so i manually sync'ed it the next day according to the instructions with no problem. easy-to-read dial low price (about $35) overall a great atomic watch worth twice what i paid ",positive
" nice watch that keeps super accurate time. however it is very basic showing only the time and date. it would be nice if it had backlighting but the hands do glow in the dark for some period of time. it is a little tricky to pick up the time signal so i would recommend finding a place in your home where the signal is strong and leave it there every night. ",positive
" this is so very handy. you can adjust your own instead of dropping it off at a jeweler and waiting for it ",positive
" i ordered these earrings a little over two months ago and i am very happy with them. they are very light weight and they do not pull on your ears. the size is perfect; very in right now. you do have to pull on the stem pretty hard to get them off because the clasp is very tight. however so far so good. they have not broken and the clasp has not become loose or anything. i even accidentally left them in a pocket once and they were put through the washing machine. they were completely fine afterward. i do wish the earrings had been about $20 less expensive. but overall i love my earrings ",positive
" i have had this watch for more than 5 years and wear it daily. i purchased it in cayman is and i think i paid a lot more than the amazon price. i love the eco-drive as it never needs attention. about a year ago the eco-drive mechanism went bad and i sent it to citizen. they replaced the mechanism for free saying it was their issue. kudos to them on that. i have been able to scratch the crystal but only after heavy abuse :) the number band around the outside still turns as well as the day i bought it. the numbers on the metallic band around the face have never worn off but the outside of the band has a nice smooth edge to it now. the lettering wore off the band after about a year so if you plan to use the dive table that is on the band don't wear it daily. else be smart and carry your own dive table on the old plastic card or on your dive computer. the band has now finally worn out after 5 years (which is how i ended up here). the two small strap holders just broke off in the past 2 weeks (they wore through) and the band is cracking but only in the holes (still holds just fine). i would buy this watch again and obviously recommend it. ",positive
" i have owned this watch for almost 4 years now with absolutely no complaints. after going through several cheaper watches to wear at work and on a casual basis i decided to spend a few extra bucks to see if i could get more wear out of one and i am sold on this one. i work in a facility that deals with chemicals that are hard on watches and i also work with mechanical equipment that is hard on crystals and this watch has held up in my working environment quite well. because i am not a diver i am not sure that this is a good diving watch but i do fish and play in the atlantic and this watch has held up through use in the sand and salt with very little care given to it. i am still on my first band and battery and the watch still keeps accurate time. the band is starting to crack a bit but after what i've put this watch through i am surprised it has held up this long. the crystal is a tad bit scratched but the other watches that i have had would have blown apart or would at least be cloudy from the blows that it's taken ",positive
" the first watch had a broken crown the date could not be changed.to amazons creditthey sent me a new one right away.this watch is fine.i needed a rubber band because i am in water a great deal of the time at workand i live near the ocean.i am always in the water with my children.so far the watch is great and has held up to expectations.no problems except when the first one was shipped broken.i would buy it again ",positive
" i love the look of this watch! i have enjoyed it for almost two weeks now and it has kept perfect time to date. originally i was attracted to the seiko skx173 which i came across first. however i was concerned that the physical size of the seiko might be too large for my wrist plus reviews indicated its automatic/mechanical movement might not be as accurate as i wanted. later i found this citizen watch which looks virtually identical yet it is smaller (diameter 38mm vs 43 height 10.5mm vs 13.5) and has a more accurate battery-driven quartz movement. it also has a longer warranty (5 years vs 3) which probably indicates that the movement is more likely to be trouble-free than the self-winding seiko. the only negative i have encountered is that it (as well as the seiko) come with a fairly bulky rubber strap. while this is more comfortable than i expected it does tend to interfere somewhat with the drape of the cuff when wearing a long sleeve shirt.

" i wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son - and came upon this ring. when it arrived i really was in awe of just how beautiful it is! it is a larger more bold ring - definitely more masculine. this is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love. it's too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only 12. hopefully i can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice ",positive
" i love these earrings! they are simple yet elegant. what's really great about them is that for a change i can wear long earrings without feeling that my ear is being pulled to the ground!! ",positive

" sounds a little strange but i needed another digital watch just to have a hourly chime so that i could do hourly reality checks that make it possible for you to have lucid dreams. ok nevermind. check out stephen laberge's books for more on that. i've had it for only a couple of weeks - bought it at a certain nationwide store that has a crosshair symbol as the emblem - and then accidentally saw this page on amazon so i thought i'd review it. it's very comfortable as another review said. it looks great. at first i was a little self conscious about wearing this big thing when i first got it home and tried it on but come to think of it it's not that much bigger than my seiko diver's i'd highly recommend it. defintely happy with it even though i won't be using most of the many features on it ",positive

" excellent watch at a great price. the teal color is absolutely beautiful and i love the style. i have several fossil watches and no complaints. they are easily adjustable water resisant and polish up nicely to look like new again ",positive
" amazon shipped the watch very quickly it arrived two days before they said it would and i was very happy with the weight and styling of the watch. a good purchase i think to myself. the only piece of styling i was not happy about was the large magnifier above the date on the watch which is not visible on the amazon photos. when i pulled out the crown to set the time and date i got that sinking feeling that something wasnt right and that feeling was followed by the whole crown comming out of the watch. i was able to put it back in and set the time but setting the date was not possible. i used amazons online return procedure filling out an html entry field box about the problem and printed out postage and a barcode to put in the box. i took it to the post office and the shipping was free although the post office was not able to insure the shipment which kind of worried me. that was 4 days ago and i still havent heard anything from amazon about the return although they did say expect 5-9 days to process returns. i hope it all goes well and i get a replacent watch. i did read about this same problem on other amazon reviews for similar watches by invicta so it is worth looking into before purchasing.

" i ordered these for my 18 month old daughter and was a little nervous i had never bought earrings on line before i wanted something with the safety backs but i had expereince with some backs that screw themselves off. i loved the butterflies and wanted to try them! my daughter has had them in her ears for a few weeks now and we haven't had any problems! i keep checking the backs and they are on nice and tight. i wanted a good quality earring so she didn't have problems with infections...and we havent! i will definately order from here again ",positive

" i bought this set for my wife as a valentine's day gift. she really liked them! they are a good size and color so they give a striking impression from a distance. the earrings come in little plastic ziplock bags all packed inside a not too special velvety bag. if you purchase this as a gift go the extra step and get something to make a better presentation. i went to wally-world and bought a $3 wooden jewelry box which conveniently enough had a heart-shaped decorative glass in the top. it was well received.

" this is not the first tool i'ld add to my work bench but it has some pieces i'm glad to have. i re-sized my watch band in just a few minutes and only had one little incident with doing something the wrong way. did i mention that the instructions are somewhat lacking? in hind-sight i should have figured it out before i made the mistake but that's hind-sight for you. if your good with working with tools and you have a need to adjust a watchband at least every christmas then this is a good deal ",positive

" great kit for working with watches. the tools were quite good quality and not flimsy and cheap. the case was also good and thankfully wasn't just the typical throw away plastic crap. the inside of the case is firm foam that keeps the tools nicely in place. the case itself is firm black leather-like material and snaps closed. the kit contains a hammer band holding base and several different sized pin drivers for removing band pins. also includes the clamp type pin remover (the blue thing) a set of screwdrivers and a thin but sturdy wedge for removing watch backs. all in all i'm quite pleased with the product. it was just what i wanted and wasn't very expensive ",positive
" atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive u.s. atomic clock in ft. collins colorado. thus all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. casio makes -- and amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes but all are equally accurate. the casio g-shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models such as this never require battery replacement. atomic accurary solar power and g-shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price ",positive
" keeps time very well(obviously). no problems getting signal to sync with atomic clock. chrono second time zone all other functions work well. love the light function better than any indiglo i have owned. only quibble is that the alarm needs to be louder ",positive
" this is the best g-shock i have owned. it looks sleek as well as casual. i had no trouble receiving the nightly signal (i live in northern new jersey). the solar power is an added bonus. a really good deal for the money ",positive
" i've had a couple of casio watches in the past pathfinders to gshocks. this watch is not too big though it has a pretty thick face the material looks and feels pretty sturdy. setting of the watch is not too difficult it's similar to other casio watches. i did not have problems getting the hands to match the digital time it appeared to do it automatially although i believe you have a feature to intentionally set them out of sync. radio atomic reception is great (austin tx). the light is based of two led's on the left and right of the watch face. although it's not as bright/easy to read as the full illuminator watches that casio/timex has it sufficiently lights up the screen to read the time and is quite pretty. pro's -great value for 79 usd you get gshock solar atomic metal band -as a previous reviewer mentioned you can remove links from the watch in about 10-15 mins with a sharp tipped knife con's -a little heavy -digital readout is tiny but adequate (the watch can actually display the current time of day in that tiny circular lcd panel) -no countdown timer -alarm is really short and pretty soft but that seems to be the case of all casio solar watche ",positive
" i'm a bit of a collector it seems (by as many watches i've accumulated and rotate out in use)... and i'd compare this watch to my others (citizen seiko vostok casio) quite well. band is well built and easy to resize myself with the tool. no problems with losing time (wish these things did dst themselves!!!) and date although somewhat hard to read does its job. the numbers on the dial are easy to read and each one (1...12) are phospholuminescent and easy to read in the dark with normal light exposure. the watch isn't heavy nor is it on the light side for waches like this and having buttons on the side has proved useful when timing things - sit-up competitions runs etc... overall very pleased ",positive
" since i had never purchased a watch by croton i did not know what to expect. the watch came in 2 boxes the first being a black cardboard box detailing the croton brand in silver on the top center of the lid. inside of this box the watch itself is encased in a nice padded black leather case with the croton name embossed on the top center of the lid. on the inside of the lid there is a pocket that stores the instruction guide and a warranty card which is neatly concealed behind a black piece of material with the croton logo in silver text. needless to say i will feel good presenting this gift to my boyfriend. the watch itself has substance to it. the shape of the watch face is unique as it looks like a more rounded rectangle. the face is blue and what is nice is that there is a bit of light texturing on the face. the blue color seems to change from dark to lighter depending on the lighting in the room. the numbers are clearly visible but the date is a bit on the small side but not terrible. when i took the watch out of the case i noticed that it was not running and at first i feared that the watch battery was dead. this was not the case however i found that the watch pin on the side was pulled out which had stopped the watch. i am not sure why this was done perhaps it is done to conserve the watch battery? the back of the watch has the croton name etched into the center and underneath it states that it has a sapphire crystal japanese quartz movement and the water resistant details. as for the bracelet it does not seem to be as heavy as i thought it would be but i will have a better idea after my boyfriend tries it on. however i am expecting that he will need to get the watch sized to fit his wrist but this not at all surprises me as this has been common practice with many of his watches. as other reviews mention the instruction booklet is not for this specific watch and is not so helpful. all in all i think this is a nice watch. its design is simple yet elegant. i think it will be a good business casual watch as it can be dressed up for the office yet be worn after hours and on weekends. another nice feature is the fact that it is water resistan ",positive
" i just received this watch and i have to say it's very sharp looking not to mention has some weight to it. this is not a flimsy watch by any means. it's all stainless steel and the clasp is the easiest i have ever had to negotiate of all the watches i have gone through over the years. it's very secure lock yet simple to unclasp. i would recommend this watch to anyone. also it's dressy and casual ~ all purpose watch ",positive

" ever notice how hard it is to find a watch that really fits the arm of your 6-year-old? not any more. this not only gave my kids a watch that actually fits it was fun for them to assemble them and they are still mixing up the colors of the bands. you can simply add or subtract links to get the perfect fit. the different links provided means if it breaks there's plenty of spares. there's no spare clasp pieces so if they break the clasp they're done but the clasps are quite sturdy the kids have broken a couple of links without breaking the clasps already. they have learned to be aware of the watch on their wrist so they haven't broken any more links since the first few days (and there's twice as many links as what we need). overall this was a great product that my kids enjoy.

" these watches are awesome. my two sons ages 6 and 8 are crazy about them. they get to customize it to their own likings which makes it easy to tell their watches apart. when they get tired of it being the same way they just change the lego pieces around (which helps them in patterning skills and math) and they have a different watch. my 8 year old had no issue changing his around but the 6 year old might have touble with this since the peices are tiny and snap tightly in to place (that's what mom's are for). this is a great beginner's watch but also large enough for older users. i wore it and thought it was great as well. it was very fun to wear everytime i looked down at it i smiled. in the day and age of digital mania it is nice to have something so fun for the children to be able to tell regular time. the price was very reasonable especially when the chances of it being lost are very great. i highly recommend this watch. i wish they had girl colors ",positive
" i purchased this watch for my 7 year old son. it is a eye catching and because it's lego it was an instant hit. it has numbers on the face (not roman numerals or lines) which is important when they are beginning to tell time. the price is fair. the only complaint he has is that it is very difficult to put on and because the band is plastic...it gets a bit sweaty. all in all it's a fun cool! watch.

" i must say i was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews but they are for my two year old so i figured they really couldn't be too small. and they are not. i also purchased other earring from some other vender for a lot more $ and guess what the quality of theese is soooo much better. all in all yes they are tiny but very cute and don't lack detail! will buy again ",positive
" the shape of this pendant is very flattering (elongated draws the eye downward). it looks great with the windows hoops i purchased at the same time. the chain is nice and as with all zina sterling - the silver is very polished and beautiful ",positive
" i wear it almost everyday and it's a lot of fun to change out the wrist band ",positive
" i bought this watch for my 5 yr old and though it works just fine the watchband is way too big for him. fortunately i am handy with a sewing machine and was able to take a pinch in the band but it makes it bulky and uncomfortable. therefore he only wears it in bed so that he can play with the indiglo feature in the dark. as soon as he gets up in the morning though he takes it off. ",positive
" i just bought this ring. it is really beautiful. it is a litttle bigger than i thought it would be but it fits good and was shipped quickly. it was a really good buy. ",positive
" pretty pendant for the price. the chain is very light but the pendant itself is nice and hangs well ",positive
" this is the second item i have ordered from this company and i am extremely pleased with the quality and value for my money. i would recommend them to anyone ",positive
" these earrings are quite nice. yes they do look brown up to the light but they are a definite red when backed with any type of shadow. they can be worn to accent an elegant look or add style to a friday casual look. they may not be heirloom quality but could last quite a long time in the modern costume jewelry category. ",positive
" fast and easy ordering received frequent order status updates. received order as expected (fast). i love these earrings. i have worn at least one day a week since i receive ",positive
" i love puzzle rings. in england it's real difficult to find them i love the jewellery on amazo ",positive
" i bought this as a present for my daughter. i was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring. (if anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together check wikipedia. i believe there is even a video.) i highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver symbolism and something just a little bit different ",positive
" nice ring fast delivery. i still need to check it out because my daughter says it doesn't completely break down the way my old puzzle ring did ",positive
" this watch is a delightful present; amazon did a great job in delivering it on time and in excellent condition and as stated in the previous review it does look better than even on the picture! keep up the fantastic work amazon you guys are a great realiable trustworthy source to send out gifts to loved ones in the us ordered from outside the us. [... ",positive
" this is a very nice watch. the pink mother-of-pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft. the date is a little small but the watch is so nice that i didn't even care. the only complaint i have is that amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside. i had to get a new battery on my own but as soon as i told amazon they credited me the $10. that was great but they should have sent me a watch in working condition. otherwise the watch is highly recommended. even nicer than in the photo ",positive
" i like the stop watch functions that this watch has. i also like the seperate dials for the different timekeeping functions. unfortunately this watch is hard to read in bright light. such as sunlight and well lit spaces. overall though i like this watch because it looks good. well it looks good on me anyway ",positive
" it's great looking the crystal positively gleams. folks comment on it all the time. i love this watch so much that i've bought it twice (lost it and simply had to replace it) ",positive
" great value looks and performes great!!!!!! has a lot of class and goes great with any type of apparel. only down fall occurs when placing the alarm it's kind off complex. ",positive
" i have owned this watch for over a month now and i can note the following: the watch has a diameter of approximately 40mm and is around 10mm thick. both these number seem average and it looks good on an average size wrist. the watch is a bit heavy but sits comfortably on the wrist. the bracelet rarely pulls the hair although i have plenty of it. the watch is easy to accumulate scratches but not on the glass. i have scratched the steel around the glass (as well as other places) but the sapphire resists remarkably. the time keeping is very accurate compared to the atomic clock on the web. after a month it has advanced less than half a second ahead which will result in a six second difference at most per year. i guess results may vary between different watches but it seems nevertheless impressive and trustworthy enough. the timer is very easy to start stop and reset with one button pushes. very fast and convenient. the alarm can barely be heard so is not appropriate for waking. it is useful though for reminders in a noise free location. not difficult to set but takes some time comparable with setting an alarm on a cell phone. since it is relative to the secondary time keeping mechanism you can have a second time zone set and advance the alarm relative to that. this watch does not seem to attract special attention to it and has not gained any comments so far without me bringing it in a conversation. is pretty conservative but i personally like that. the price of this watch in amazon seems to fluctuate between 100 and 140 dollars. if the price is higher than 130 i would wait a tad but not hold my breath too long. it is definately worth the money though since i have seen several seiko watches like this one enter their 20 or 30 years of age and still continue strong. for a dependable accurate water proof watch for every occasion most probably you cannot do better than this ",positive
" i ordered 2 watchesone for each grandaughter.one arrived with dead batteryhad it replaced and both are working well.they where well received by the granddaughter ",positive
" got this today and can't stop looking at it. it's beautiful. all who have seen it want one. i cant wait to try more of their jewelry ",positive
" i actually bought 2 different pair of diamond ear rings. the 14k gold ones were the keepers! they are pretty and big enough to use as a second pair in my ears! thanks to amazon for this offering ",positive
" i bought these for my wife and she really likes them. they're small enough that she can wear them day-to-day but they're nice enough for formal occasions as well. this is a very versatile set of earrings at a great price ",positive
" i couldn't belive my eyes when i saw diamond earrings with such an affordable price! i definitely think that selecting white gold is the way to go because it won't distract from the mesmerizing glamour of the diamonds. all my friends were wowed and shared that they will also consdier buying a pair. i am so happy. ",positive
" these earrings are very small maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each. they do appear white (i don't see any yellow tinting) with a slight slight bit of grey which i prefer over a super white look (as you might sometimes find in a cz). these earrings catch the light nicely showing a bit of rainbow effect. they aren't super super sparkly or faceted but they do possess shine and detail. i am very happy with these earrings as they are just what i wanted: something petite and real set in yellow gold and with a nice clean and believably sparkly look! i also like the fit of the earrings backs very tight and secure. ",positive
" i really like it it's an excellent watch and also a very elegant one ",positive
" i bought these for my wife and she liked them very much. 7mm is not as small as you may think. i certainly wouldn't buy anything larger in this style. i got them on sale for $15.00 can't go wrong with that price for 14k gold ",positive
" i bought these earrings as a christmas gift for my wife and they look great. my wife has long dark hair and the 7mm size really stands out. they came in a dark blue velvet jewel/ring box which comes in another dark blue box. my wife really loves them so that's a bonus for me. they are a nice little something for yourself or as a gift ",positive
" bellisimos los zarcillos los uso muy a menudo y el tiempo en que hice la orden fue bien rapida su entrega su tamao real concuerda con las medidas que ofrecen ",positive
" these earrings just arrived and for $10 (friday sale) you cannot beat this value. luckily i bought two pair one as a gift and one for me on the off chance i liked them. otherwise i thought i could hold the second pair for one of my granddaughters. no way; the second pair is mine ",positive
" the box is soft and very durable. but it is a bit big. ",positive
" this heart box is great for your skagen or other brand watches or you can use it as a jewlery box for your bracelets. the box makes a v-day or anniversary gift even more special. your loved ones will appreciate the box as a sentimental reminder of the special gift. the watch pillow is plush padded box top and outside & inside box is lined with velvet ",positive
" i am not the type of person that wears jewelry but when i went shoping for a watch because i needed one one brand caught my eye...fossil. everyone knows fossil so everyone knows that they make good watches. i like this watch because of the color and because it has the day # on the face. it is like your everyday watch but with that bling look. very cool and very james bond. if you know what i mean. i plan to wear this watch everywhere i go. you should get this one not only because it looks cool but because of the price. you know that $$$ makes up your mind for you ",positive
" i bought this along with the butterfly pendant and 18 chain for a christmas gift (06) for my god-daughter and she loves them both. i loved the price! the earrings are a perfect fit with the necklace. she says she only wears them to church and special occasions. a great gift for teenage girls ",positive
" i'm very pleased with these earrings. they are a good weight...they aren't so heavy that they drag at the ear but they are substantial and a perfect size. i'd recommend these to earring lovers ",positive
" these earrings are beautifully made look great when put on and come at a great price. all these ingredients make a stunning value. i am a very pleased customer. ",positive
" i had these on my wish list and decided to order them for myself after christmas after looking in stores and not finding anything that looked quite the same! they just arrived and all i can say is wow! nice look substantial size and plenty of statement. picture does not do them justice. all i can say is don't hesitate you will be dissappointed if they sell out ",positive
" how can you go wrong with these two-tone hoops? they are stylish and substantial and perfect for both white and yellow gold lovers. highly recommended for yourself or as a gift ",positive
" my 26 yr old son got this for his birthday. he loved it and wears at always ",positive
" i bought this as a christmas gift (06) for my god-daughter michelle. she absolutely adored it. she told me she only wears it to church and special occasions. i loved the price ",positive
" this is a great choice for a business casual style watch. with it's crystal clear face and smooth shape it complements most business attire nicely. the adjustment button doesn't get pulled easily so there is less chance of accidental time loss. after several weeks of wear still no scratches on the watchface and the metal remains untarnished. i still get questions about it. definitely an eye-catcher ",positive
" this watch was a very good buy..for $ 45..looks like a nice 85-90$ fossil watch..the dial looks very elegant..with those numbers.. overall..i am very happy with this buy ",positive
" great watch looks very similar to a movado but worth the price. sharp look and perfect for any occasion ",positive
" the watch i purchased was great and a lifesaver because i couldn't find it in any stores and needed it as a gift for the best man at my wedding. it got to me quickly and was perfect. thanks ",positive
" the watch itself looks preety elegant. however the bracelet is a bit too rigid and it cand be very unconfortable until you get used to it. i don't regret buying it. it's worth the money ",positive
" is a nice clocksome people tall to me about the clockthe people sayis nice the clock ",positive
" got this watch for my one son for christmas but ended up going to the other son since his arm is on the small size and this is a pretty good size watch. it is beautiful and well described. arrived in perfect condition and had no problem requesting extra links using the fossil toll free # and then the local store that sells fossils put the links in for me. i went with a small dress watch for the other son.. everyone was happy ",positive
" greetings exelente product and magnifies attention from the store thanks kindly domenico pascarell ",positive
" got this ring last christmas for my wife. it still looks very nice and looks more expensive than it is. she gets lots of compliments on it when she wears it ",positive
" i am very impressed with the detail work on this ring. it is really eye catching and quite lovely. the shipment arrived very quickly. the stone is a true emerald shade of green and the cut is nice but the clarity of the stone could be a little better. however for the price it is an excellent ring and i would gladly give it as a gift ",positive
" this was a gift and i was very pleased with both the quality and extremely fast shipping. i will definitely purchased from this seller again ",positive
" this ring is beauriful and eye catching. i unfortunatey wore it in a hot tub that had too much clorine in it so the shinyness of the metal faded and despite that the ring remains beautiful ",positive
" i was searching the web for weeks... i saw thousands of watches... and i didn't like them. when i saw this watch... that was it - one of the most beautiful watches in the world. i think design of this watch is superb - very simple but astonishingly beautiful and original. but there is one problem with this watch - it can be purchased only in north america. being from europe i had difficulties to get it ",positive
" i have thoroughly enjoyed these earrings. very nice size and great quality. they are light-weight and have a great hinge. i have a baby who sometimes grabs them but they have yet to be bent out of shape. i sometimes keep them in for days at a time and my sensitive ears don't ever develope a reaction ",positive
" this necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift. she wears it everyday with every outfit. it looks great with jeans and a t-shirt and with an extravagent dress. ",positive
" outstanding service - product was as described and the price was fair - mailing in a timely manner was acceptable. will continue to shop for similar items via amazon ",positive
" the necklace is great. it looks great and my wife loved it. one of the diamonds was a little gray (something stuck behind it) but after having it cleaned at a jewelers it looks fantastic. great price for a great item ",positive
" this is a perfect anytime gift. i bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it. we have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top. perfect for any occasion. she'll love it. this will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anything plus it's under 100. can't beat the price. thanks amazon ",positive
" i really love these earrings and wear them quite a bit to spice up work clothes. ",positive
" i really like them. they look elegent on me. one of the most favorite parts besides the looks that i especially like is that they are the french loop kind that are easy and fast to put on and that they are heavy enough that they stay in place. this reduces the risk of losing them. but they are also light enough that i dont feel bogged down with them on my ears. ",positive
" not much else o say they look and wear awesome. the price is very good as well. recommend these for anyone with pierced ears ",positive
" excellent quality beautifully packaged. they were exactly as described and just what i was looking for. ",positive
" very good quality for the price. they are simple understated and classic in design. if you want flashy however these are not for you. you can ignore the 1-star reviews--the 1-star rating goes to those who a) don't read the description before ordering b) don't know what mm stands for or c) don't have the visual-spatial skills to estimate the size of the earring in the picture by comparing the overall size to the earwire (which tends to be a fairly similar size on most earrings). and please if you can't tell 14k from $5.00 dimestore stuff that will likely turn your ears green then your money is wasted here. go to walmart and get yourself something big and cheap ",positive
" exactly the size i was looking for. i knew i could do better than the baby hoop earrings. looks great ",positive
" these are delicate classic gold hoops that go with anything. i like the fact that they are unadorned and simple and small enough to be understatated but large enough to give you an elegant look. the price can't be beat either ",positive
" i am very small featured and these are the perfect size. light weight and very well made ",positive
" these are beautiful small earrings just what i was looking for. they're exactly as described 11mm inside diameter. i used the super-saving shipping and was surprised at how quickly they arrived. i'm very pleased with the entire transaction ",positive
" the watch was delivered on time. it came with the little box; everything was in great like new condition. ",positive
" wonderful watch easy transaction given as a birthday present recipient loved that it came in a can ",positive
" the best dive watch money can buy bar none. for $150 you are getting a product that is unparalleled in quality and performance. it's not perfect and at around $150 it doesn't have to be but what you are getting for that amount is far more what i can expect in swiss automatics 3x this price range or more. and don't listen to the lone naysayer out there...i'm not sure what pipe they are smoking out of but the luminosity of this watch is legendary among watch collectors....charge it up in light for a few seconds and watch this bad boy light up like chernobyl. i will echo a truth a fellow collector once related to me...any serious watch collector should have a black monster in their collection. ",positive
" i have owned both the black monster with bracelet ( my daily work watch )and the orange with the rubber strap ( which i sold to an envious friend ). besides all of the compliments that i have received from those who cant help but to notice the robust build of this model it has also paid dividends in durability under rough service on the job. i have not been diving in many years however this is the watch that i would be most confident to wear at depth. as usual seiko does not disappoint ",positive
" purchased this for my niece and she loved it. it's a great price and bright and colorful ",positive
" great value for the price. better than expected in person. quality watch for the price. love this undersea face better than the other models out there. was happy to find out that even though the band is kid sized it also fits adult women's wrist. highly recommend. will probably buy one or 2 more ",positive
" although this watch (#mc0478) is labeled for kids it is best geared for a girl 12-years or older. the timepiece portion appears to be better quality than the jelly strap which looks very cheap. i purchased this as a gift for my 18-year old sister and went to a local jeweler to replaced the plastic band with a nice blue/green leather one. overall my sister who loves the little mermaid is pleased with this watch. so far she hasn't reported any problems with the timepiece. for the price it's a good value for the timepiece but i would recommend upgrading the band. the little mermaid face is the main reason i purchased this watch but if you are looking for a good quality timepiece/band you may consider another watch ",positive
" this was a gift for my 17 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it and wears all the time!!!! i am seriously thinking of getting myself one ",positive
" very cute price efficiant... only problem is if the band gets wet and you have sunscreen on your arm will get tinted blue ",positive
" our granddaughter loves her horse necklace! she wears it all the time and is so proud of it! this necklace made her very happy ",positive
" this is the most beautiful bracelet. the piece is awesome. the sentiment is so true. i love this bracelet and decided to keep it even though i'd bought it as a gift. the workmanship is superb. the bracelet arrived 2 days after i placed my order in a well packaged box; the bracelet was in a white box with a gold ribbon around it ",positive
" i bought two of these faux amber necklaces and they are quite well made. the pendant is almost 2 inches in length it does look larger in the photograph but by being smaller it looks more realistic. it is actually a good weight not to heavy not to light it looks as if some effort has been put into the making of it. i think it is a good purchase for the price because it does not look cheap or tacky ",positive
" i like the unique style of this necklace and received compliments on it when i wore it to work. the price is reasonable for the type of necklace having such unique beads ",positive
" these lovely little gems are perfect for those women who like me have a second or third ear piercing. small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious. these would make a great gift for a little girl as well.i particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as i suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear. having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection. at the price of under 10 dollars i was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there how are you. ",positive
" simple and elegant earrings. my wife loves them. however the backs are a trifle small to work with. ba ",positive
" i got these for $9 on the friday sale. they are well made and the perfect size. you absolutely will not find a better pair for the price. wait for the friday sale if you can ",positive
" this is a gift that has yet to be given. i am confident that she will love them though ",positive
" these are basic simple earrings of exceptional quality given the price. you would likely pay far more for comparable items elsewhere ",positive
" i am really happy with this purchase! the earrings came together in an attractive box (perfect as a gift but i don't want to give them away). they are nice and large on my earlobe and look great. they are really soft to the touch and i like the colors too. ",positive
" i got these to give to my mother-in-law. they are really lovely not too dressy so you can wear them everyday. i'm glad i jumped on them while they were on sale they'll be perfect for mother's day ",positive
" get this earring set. i got both sets this one and the pastel set to give as gifts the pearls are lovely the colors are brilliant. nice set to have or to give. ",positive
" this earrings were much larger than they seemed. they sparkle and catch the light like prisms. they made a fabulous present ",positive
" i bought thes earrings(and pendant)for myself. they are absolutely beautiful they have so much shine and sparkle to them. everyone keeps asking me where i got them i'm reluctant to tell but i do. :- ",positive
" i bought these as a gift for my beautiful fiance for christmas. at first she wasn't overly impressed but when she put them on (to humour me) she found them very pretty and unusual. the crystals really reflect the light and she was extremely pleased with them ",positive
" i bought two pairs one as a gift for a sister-in-law and the other pair for myself (otherwise i would regret it!) now my sister keeps complementing how beautuiful the earrings are- i bought another pair as a gift for her! the earrings are absolutely beautiful the colors that reflect in the light are truly gorgeous. i recommend these for anyone that loves swarovski crystal ",positive

" just received the necklace today and i am more than happy with it. it arrived quickly and the packaging is fantastic! it came in a little blue box and in a blue velvet bag...very nice the necklace is good quaility and has a great shine to it. i might just have to order one for myself after xmas...this one is a present ",positive
" equal to my swiss watches. fit and finish is very nice. only two seconds off per day. the luminessence is incredable. reason not giving five stars because of not having saphire crystal ",positive
" i'm a regular collector of diving watches and this is one of my favorite ones. there is something about diving watches that is really attractive though it could be subconscious and because of the fact that you can get it wet and it would still work. this watch feels rock solid like it just came out from a huge chunk of metal. for such a quality feel the price is super amazing. i would have to go for my submariner for a similar feel and on some days i prefer the feel of this than of my submariner! the luminated markers are the brightest i ever seen on any watch diving or non-diving. clasp is super-awesome better than the submariner. bracelet is not as nice looking but ok. the moveable bezel has the best click of any of the diving watches i own and this is the least expensive dive watch of all but unfortunately i paid a little too much. the only downside and may not be for you if you don't adjust your bands but if you do it's a chore. i spend hours trying to do this and was only successful after improvising as the linking system is very unusual ",positive
" an excellent watch stylish accurate and takes a beating! seiko has always had a success with this one. and at $150 i paid half the retail price ",positive
" from the moment you first hold this watch in your hand you realize it is a quality timepiece. the first thing that strikes you is its large size and heavy feel yet despite that it feels comfortable on the wrist due to its fine balance. bracelet: the bracelet end links (those that attach to the watch case) are solid rather than formed sheet metal like you will find on most other watches in this price range. the pins holding the bracelet to the watch are the sturdiest i have ever seen. each of the bracelet's subsequent links is also made from a solid piece of steel not folded sheet each component being feather-edged to prevent it digging into the wrist. its removable link pins are of an unusual machined pin and collar design which though fiddly to remove and replace nevertheless ensure that the pins remain under-flush and secure when correctly installed. the bracelet is perfectly flush on the side that contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear. the clasp is very high quality having both a fold over security buckle which deploys with a satisfying click and an omega style double button catch. the security buckle closes onto a spring pin whose ends are spherical thus ensuring a tight fastening which should not wear with use. all in all these features add up to a watch that is very quiet on the wrist the only faint sound coming from its automatic winding mechanism. finally the bracelet incorporates a clever hidden diver's extension (to allow the watch to be worn over a wet suit). case: the watch case back and bezel are made from stainless steel. the case has an attractive mix of polished brushed and machined finishes which all add to the feel of quality and function. the overall impression is that this is a precision instrument rather than a fashion piece; that's not to say though that it would look out of place with a dinner jacket any more than a wet suit. the unidirectional bezel is of a heavily scalloped design protected by bezel-guards which extend upwards from each of the lug pairs. the lower guard also functions as a crown guard and all in all the impression is of a case machined from a solid billet of steel. the bezel sits slightly higher than the domed crystal thus providing protection from scratching and the crystal itself is of a proprietary seiko material hardlex which as i understand it is better at resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible to shattering than sapphire. the luminosity of this watch is astounding due partly to the use of seiko's proprietary lumibrite paint but also to the large coated areas on the hour markers and hands. the bezel only turns one way as a safety feature for timing dives and feels silky smooth the best i've experienced on any seiko or invicta diver. it has 120 clicks per revolution and is nicely aligned with the face. movement: the watch uses the 21 jewel seiko 7s26 movement running at 21600 bph (that's 6 ticks per second). it is non-hacking which means that the second hand does not stop when the crown is pulled out. although this makes it difficult to synchronize if a slight backward pressure is applied to the fully extended crown it is possible to stop the second hand. the watch can not be hand wound but the self winding mechanism is very efficient and i have found that it has a power reserve of at least 24 hours. the 7s26 has been around for many years and has a reputation for ruggedness and reliability. accuracy: there are several reviews where people complain of poor accuracy. typically when new automatic movements will be set to run fast at the factory because they tend to slow down after a few weeks of use. i own three watches with the 7s26 movement and after their breaking in period all are now keeping time to within 10 seconds per day. i have a few thoughts on accuracy. you have to ask yourself how accurate does your watch need to be? if it is running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow and you will only need to re-set it once every week or two when it has advanced to one minute fast. if you need more accuracy then unless you are willing to pay at least five times as much for a swiss watch then buy a quartz. finally if you do a search on the seiko monster you'll quickly come to realize that in its various colours these watches are firm favourites amongst those who frequent the many watch forums. i would highly recommend that you purchase one and see for yourself! ",positive
" i've had a lot of watches in my life. some dressy some functional and some practically indestructible. this watch is a combination of all these factors. very solid feeling (and much heavier than my titanium dive watch). looks great and functions well. i also like the wetsuit link which allows a quick adjustment to fit over your wetsuit. the orange face is very legible and at night the watch glows almost bright enough to read by! the clasp is very secure with a dual button release and an extra clasp to prevent accidental opening. day & date are easy to adjust and very readable (much better than my citizen). this is a solid performing watch and worth the money ",positive
" the watch looks great; prominent yet not overly large. the orange really sets off the look. the large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark. i also like having both day and date complications and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than $300 (way less on amazon) is really a find. you will need a pro to adjust the bracelet though as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler's tools. another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day. overall i really like it. it's become my daily wear watch. ",positive
" the bracelet is a very bright and shiny quite nice. it's alot lighter than i was expecting i almost mistook it for plastic at first. it would make a nice gift for a young teen girl ",positive
" i bought three of these for friends for christmas and i have to say that i loved them. and most of all they loved them. they are gorgeous! just enough sparkle without being too much. i highly recommend this if you are looking for something classy and slightly understated ",positive
" my granddaughter loves this bracelet - i sent it as a surprise and she wore it to school the next day ",positive
" i was a little worried that the bracelet would be too large for a 5 year old but i got this for my daughter's birthday and it fits her perfectly. i was also a little concerned that it might be cheap looking like other things i've bought from amazon lately but it's actually a very cute well-made cheap bracelet ",positive
" made a little girl very happy. order processed shipped and delivered in a timely manner. just as expected ",positive
" good looking stylish smart and clean design handsome. once i was specifically looking for animated watches. this was one of the results. although given amazon description is really lacking details. i bought it and didn't really know what are the features in general and also specifically concerning the animation. so now i know. it has a button aside that is switching between two animation schemes. one: seconds numeric value rotates clockwise on the display; two: seconds drop down in two halfs on the display. thats all for animation and features in general. no light no more animations no stoppers/timers nothing else; just plain watch. for me the good looks somewhat compensates the thing i was originally looking for ",positive
" good tool it does what is it meant to do open the back of watches with ease. man this is so much better than scratching watchbacks with pliers. so far its been able to open all my watches with no issue ",positive
" this garinin autowinder does exactly what it is supposed to do. keeps both my autos running and ready for use. it is quiet smooth and looks pretty good sitting atop my computer desk. it has a variety of settings that will meet the needs of almost any auto watch on the market. it is well built and works as described ",positive
" i have had this winder for about a month now and i am very happy with it. the major convenience is the well-engineered slots and iserts holding watches that are of a very good quality. the inserts are holding watches steadily which contributes to proper winding. all previous more expensive winders with cushion type inserts were falling out (with watches!)and eventually were rendered useless. highly recommended unit ",positive
" i have seen many other winders in the market with the same features but with much higher prices. this winder is so quiet that i have no problem sleeping even with it on. i highly recommend it ",positive
" it exceeded my expectation. it looks great and seems quite sturdy. i bought for casual days when i am either skiing or just hanging out on a weekend. i like it ",positive
" i purchased these watches for my daughters birthday party and they were a big hit - all the kids just loved them!! ",positive
" once i got the hang of it it worked like a charm. i needed to mount a magnifying glass to the table so i could see for perfect alignment. if not perfectly aligned you break pins. now that i got the hang of it i have one pin left i keep e-maling seller to buy more pins but seller won't answer. does anyone know where to get more pins? i would buy another unit but seller went to the bank on shipping charges ",positive
" i have several fossil watches and every time i needed to adjust the band it cost me around $10 - $15. i found this tool and figured it was worth a try. i was able to remove links from 2 of my fossil watches though my newest fossil watch band was too wide to easily fit in the tool. i even used it to adjust watches for 2 of my friends.it worked well made the adjustments and they were very happy with it! they plan to buy it for themselves! you do have to make sure the pin lines up correctly with the pin but beyond that it works like a dream ",positive
" wind the pin in ever so slowly and watch if you aren't going into the hole. the smallest inaccuracy can cause the pin to bend. i straighted mine out and go the pin hole next try and it worked a dream. also good lighting is a must ",positive
" use care when you use it as it can be easy to break pins but it works just like it should and it's easier and cheaper than going to a watch store ",positive
" small illustrated manual makes it easy to figure out how to use. with a steady hand and some patience i was able to re-size a couple of my watches. it was really handy ",positive
" i got this yesterday from my boyfriend and i love it. it's very pretty and i was extremely happy to unwrap it. = ",positive
" i was expecting this watch to be a little more chunky than it is. it is a little smaller than i pictured but it is a nice non flashy watch. i haven't received any compliments on it after wearing it for a few weeks so if you are looking for a subtle but cute watch this is for you. but if you want a watch that makes a statment and that people will notice i'd look elsewhere ",positive
" i love the jewel jet because it is exactly what my jeweler uses except now i can clean my diamond at home when i want.it is easy to use. just follow the directions ",positive
" this is a great product if you have lots of jewelry. this cleans everything perfectly no more harsh chemicals. very fast and sufficient. certainly worth the money ",positive
" i ordered my unit directly from jewel jet. aside from receiving the unit in a box that was severely damaged as it was drop shipped in its own box i have no complaints with it working as advertised. the unit is quite large so you may not want to leave on the counter but the results are spectacular. it definitely out cleans my sonic cleaner. i have not been able to see a difference between this and the results after i get my jewelry steamed at a large retailer like fortunoff. i first used it on a g color vs stones but it has caused me to start pulling out pieces of lesser quality that i have not worn in ages to give them a revitalizing breath of fresh steam and i still label the results as spectacular. i love that i am achieivng these great results with just adding tap water. with my own experimenting i honestly couldn't tell a difference when using after precleaning pieces in a detergent solution as a competing model - that uses both detergent and distilled water - claims ",positive
" the steamer works very very well. sure beats paying for or even just the hassle of taking your stuff to the jeweler and wondering if you got back what you took in. great gadget ",positive
" i purchased this version of the ironman triathlon 30-lap for my two pre-teen boys. they love it! very durable...easy to use...lightweight. can't beat the value either. i own the larger men's version of this watch. i'm on my second one though. the first one lasted about a year before it developed condensation under the glass then stopped working. i surf 3-4 times per week and i wasn't rinsing the watch well with fresh water. i'm guessing that the salt deposits compromised the seal on the watch. i've had my second one for over a year now and it's like new! i highly recommend this watch if you're very active and want a good lightweight watch that's waterproof ",positive
" i have owned several ironman over the last 30 years or so and i have been pleased. however my last timex watch had a twist of the dial control function and was a great disappointment as the dial became difficult to twist and finally the watch stopped working after only six months. i was very disappointed in timex and almost didn't buy this one. this watch is the traditional men's ironman but smaller than i had purchased before and it fits nicely on my large wrist with plenty of band length. i have owned the new watch for three months with fairly rugged use and it functions great with easy to operate controls and it is very readable. my wife and adult children tell me that it looks like a women's watch but i think they are used to oversized wathes that have been in style and i assure them that i am on the cutting edge of a new trend towards smaller (and more reasonally sized) wrist watches for men. i am happy to say that once again i am very pleased with timex. ",positive
" these are very comfortable earrings. i even sleep in them. the hoops go with everything and i very seldom wear other earrings now. ",positive
" these earrings are a good size but still very light. it is a little tricky to learn how to fasten them but once hooked they stay safely closed all day. the clasp sytem does not show once the earrings are on - so this is a very clean and classic look. i have long hair and the clasp does not tangle in my hair ",positive
" i loved the earrings but unfortunatly one of them was faulty and had to send it back. the package was lost in the transition but amazon gave me a full refund and was very helpful. the earrings were beautiful and of good quality ",positive
" a quality earring good size and very bright. the are also very secure. ",positive
" i got this as agift in she likesd it very much ",positive
" i had no trouble with and delay and the pendant looks great which was a gift for my sister and she loved it ",positive
" this is a very nice piece... i've been looking for a key pendant for a while now... but all the ones i've seen have been very feminine. and this one while slightly satanic... fits nicely to the meaning i wanted without making me feel like a fairy princess. shipping even got here early...! my only problem with it is having to pull out the pliers to get it to fit on a different neck piece from the same seller. 4/5 ",positive
" i came in a timely manner and was exactly what i expected. the person that received it loved it ",positive
" i bought this to save for a christmas gift.it is a very nice looking piece of jewelry ",positive
" silver insanity has the best accessories!!! i saw the image of the ring on amazon and immediately fell in love. i love rings that covers your proximal phalanx (the bone in your finger closest to your hand). when i received the ring (earlier than counted upon) i was a little disappointed to see how little it looked and how dainty but that was before i tried it on. i was expecting the ring to be bulky and glad it wasn't. the fingers surrounding it wasn't bothered or irritated thx to the rings slimness. i recommend using the ring size chart b/c i had thought i'd be a 6; turns out i'm a 7. what was misleading though is the picture. the leaves are shown bright but it looks noticably darker (inside the outer rimming of the leaf to where the gems are) when you have it in your hands. my fingers are long and slender. the ring didn't twist or turn about but it didn't cover my proximal phalanx completely. i'll measure... from the end of the bottom leave to the end of the top it's about 3.3cm. my middle proximal phalanx (the bone in your middle finger closest to your hand) is about 3.8cm. and if you should run your fingers through your hair the leaves will not get entangled! nice! you can wear the damn ring everywhere!!! i love it ",positive
" as other reviewers have stated - this watch is large and it's heavy. i think it would look best on a larger person with big wrists or arms. the night light is cool and effective. ",positive
" perfect watch just as i expected. lokks great both casual and semi formal ",positive
" happy with the purchase the watch was what i expected. casual enough to wear to work or for a night ou on the town. ",positive
" classy look and very durable. very nice watch for the price. i bought mine at a discount store and paid about $6 more for it. i like it despite its 10mm thickness. not that heavy if you're like me 6'2 and 250lbs. it's a man's watch practical yet with some style while not being trendy. i haven't had any problems with it so far despite having dropped it twice and worn it outside while working and getting it soaked with sweat multiple times. i don't find it uncomfortable at all and i forget i am wearing it. (i suggest taking it off the leather band doesn't clean easily like a metal band.) i'm considering buying a second one and keeping it cleaner this time. (lesson learned. ",positive
" i wanted a basic watch that would be for everyday use and liked this timex design. i was very pleased that it looked even nicer in person...clear face leather band with slightly heavier stitching than some good weight (not too heavy). i have received a few compliments at work/co-workers were surprised at the value for the cost. overall a solid timex offering that you will enjoy if you're drawn to the style/image that appears here in the product details ",positive
" i really love this watch. it looks so nice and elegant. shipping is supper fast: only 2 days! great deal. many thanks ",positive
" i ordered (not from amazon) a black titanium watch with a black face and white hands (model 530ltmlb for those of you scoring at home). after an apologetic out-of-stock phone call from the dealer i settled on what i thought was going to be the same watch but with a white face and black hands (model 530ltmlw for you precise types). what i got instead was this watch. in the photograph it looks like dark gray matte metal with a white face. it's not: it's eggshell light gray metal with a mother-of-pearlish face. i hadn't worn a watch in five years: after all who needs one in the cell-phone age? (definitive answer: anyone driving across country with a sprint cellphone). i took my sweet time selecting a new watch and got something completely different from what i ordered. i could easily have returned it. before i did i slipped in on my wrist to see what it felt like and promptly forgot that it was there. (to the nice lady who answered my request for the time with a drop-dead-you're-wearing-a-watch response can i say that it wasn't actually a pickup line?) the titanium thing is not a gimmick: this watch is (obviously) very light indeed and solid. i have hopes that the light gray colour is undoctored titanium alloy in which case it will still look good after life deals it some hard knocks. i set it to the exact (down to the second) correct time when i got it a month ago. it either has a very good movement or it's secretly communicating with that atomic clock in colorado without my knowledge. some reviewers have complained about a poor latch: i respectfully suggest they don't know how to close it. the watch has a very secure double-latch which is poorly-explained but is not rocket science - i've added the instructions at the end. some complain about noise: this might be a quality-control issue. i can't comment to it because my watch is as quiet as the heartbeat of a fetus. (update several weeks later: the watch is slowly becoming louder but the loudness changes irregularly even when the watch is sitting by my bed. it is still very quiet but but the fact that it is changing does not speak well to long-term durability.) it gets 4 stars because i can't tell the time with my glasses off which is why i wanted a high-contrast watch in the first place. but they're not getting this one back. latch instructions: to get us properly oriented lay the watch flat with the face up. on one end of the strap is the half of the clasp that also contains the strap length adjustment. open up the clasp part. next to the strap length adjustment mechanism you will see a plain bar. now look at the other end of the strap: on the very end of it is a solid curved clasp. swing it open and you will see a wide double hook. put the watch on your wrist and attach the double hook to the plain bar. next close the solid clasp until it clicks. next close the other clasp over the first one also until it clicks. it is provably impossible for any single brush up against an object (say an outboard motor) to loosen it ",positive
" i've had this watch for about nine months now. i wear it every day. it keeps great time and looks great as well. many people have complimented me on the design of this watch and asked me who made it. the mesh band is the most comfortable and lightest band you will ever wear. ",positive
" i saw these skagen watches in a local clock store and fell in love with the titanium model. it is extremely light and comfortable. i was a little concerned about quality because it was so inexpensive for titanium. though the movement is made in japan the rest of the watch is assembled somewhere else i would assume hong kong. the word denmark on the face is strictly for style no part of the watches are made there. regardless it seems to be very well made; i've had mine for a year now and it keeps excellent time and runs reliably. i bought a different skagen model for my wife at the same time and hers is just as well made. it has been a great watch and i heartily recommend it. edit: i have been taking swimming lessons and wearing this watch during them. it has not leaked a drop. i was told it was not suitable for any real depth such as those encountered while snorkeling or scuba diving but every other underwater test i've given it it has passed. ",positive
" love the earrings. i have small earlobes and use these earrings in my second holes. they are just perfect. ",positive
" the pliers do the job & seem to be well made. my only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link. i guess if you remove the band from the watch it would make it easier. in that case i recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface. but...this did do the job (even leaving the band on the watch). it comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out ",positive
" this item far exceeds what i thought it would be i am very please ",positive
" i never adjusted a watch band before and i thought it was going to be difficult after reading the other reviews on the other watch tools. this tool could not have made it any easier i didn't break any pins and i adjusted two watch bands the night it arrived with ease. you will need a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the watch pin completely out of the band. i adjusted an accutron lady's york and a swiss army men's maverick. i used the tool to remove and replace the watch pins just line the pins and squeeze the pliers slowly. the accutron used solid pins and the swiss army used pins that looked like they were screws but were pins that are cut or bent in half so always push from the end that looks like a screw head ",positive
" i first purchased this watch in 1994 when i entered the selection coarse to be an air force cct. i lost the watch years later but i would occasionally try to find a replacement with no luck. i now work for us doj and will be deployed to baghdad for a while and i need a watch i will be able to absolutely depend on in extreme conditions. this is the only watch i will ever own. i cannot say enough about it. maybe i'm sentimental but i love this watch ",positive
" i was so happy in receiving the watch so fast.they do good business ",positive
" my husband bought this for the 2nd time after losing the first. it is nice for dressy or casual. highly recommended ",positive
" i bought my first casio diver's watch with the gold face years ago. i wore the heck out of it and eventually the band broke. i must have hunted for a replacement band or a whole new watch but to no avail. a long-time friend then just sat in a drawer. recently i found these watches were still available so i got a new one. i even found a replacement band (made by timex) for my original watch. i must say i once again feel whole again. this watch has timeless styling and wonderful functionality in a very reasonable priced watch. i'm thinking about getting the black and the white ones so i can switch it up from time to time ",positive
" this watch was great. i really loved the digital feature residing in the analog face. i don't know about others out there but analog watches are the only way to go. i love the fact that i can visually see what time it is in a graphical representation but i love having the digital features such as the alarm timer stopwatch and date feature. i wore the watch 24/7 and it never ever gave me a problem however when i was filming an independent film within a west texas silo i lost the watch climbing the ladder out. i was climbing a straight vertical steel pipe ladder and as i reached the top hatch which lead to the top landing my watch face caught on the side of the steel ladder and the band pins broke. next thing i knew i heard a plop and new my wonderful watch was on its way to the bottom of a 120 foot watery depth!! i will probably get another one but i really would love one with a metal band ",positive
" overall the watch is awesome. i do actually use it when diving though it is only rated as water resistant and not waterproof. i can say it holds up to at least 90 feet. the dial is very readable at depth the digital display however is not. the multifunction display has no backlight and at times can be hard to make out even on land. the display does have luminescent hands and numbers that can be make out with no problem. very comfortable and functional ",positive
" i first got one of these when it was issued to me in the air force back in the early 1990's. as a fighter pilot (former) i've busted more watches in cockpits than most but this one held up. now that i'm in the more sedate confines of an airline cockpit i still wear it. it has dual time zones and an alarm perfect for international travel. beware it's a big watch! if that's not your style you may want to see one in person before you buy. the only drawback... the plastic/rubber band will crack after 2+ years and need replacement. i put a nice leather band on mine and even had a passenger compliment me on my breitling. when i told him it was a casio and cost $4950 less he wanted one too. ",positive
" after nearly two months my two automatic watches are ticking happily away. the mechanism is very quiet and the winder looks tidy. the only critisism i have is lack of instructions to mount the watches. maybe all winders work the same way but this was my first experience with wone and it took a while to work out the watch mounts are spring loaded to accept teh watch band. once i sorted that out - no problem ",positive
" the product as i recalled cost about $36 for a double winder. the product works quite well and is reasonably quiet. if one reads one of the watch magazines on the market one will quickly find out there are many watch winders out there and most cost a lot of money--in the hundreds to thousands of dollars. this product is in the tens of dollars and works very well. i am very happy with the product--as well as amazon (dot) com. ",positive
" owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month......this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months....it is still running like clock work......would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one..... ",positive
" i recently received the item and i love it. it is whisper quiet works in both directions and is automatic. i have seen other winders at 5x this price that don't do the same. any of the winder would be a waste of money unless they sell a single winde ",positive
" could not have gotten a better deal. it has been working for the last 2 months. very quite i leave it in the bedroom. can't beat the price. recommended for those automatic watch lovers you can buy 4 of these for the price of an others model ",positive
" the pendant was a little smaller than i expected but lovely nonetheless ",positive
" i needed to replace another timex ironman 100 lap watch i had purchased a few years back (the rubber frame that holds the strap broke). really liked this watch because of the large readout ease of use lap calculation. i'm a marathoner and novice triathlete so a good simple versatile watch is an important piece of equipment for me. after looking for over a month i decided to purchase the timex triathlon 100 lap flix system watch and i'm glad i did. great readout easy button control (start and split are much more pronounced - great improvement) and a very sturdy velcro strap makes this a winner for me. i've already used the timer function with alarm for my swim and bike intervals and of course the chrono function with splits is easy to read and use. this is a great watch!

" although glass they do look like opals and have a lovely irridescent qualit ",positive
" this is the second pair of earrings i got from silver insanity and i can tell you you won't be dissapointed. they may be synthetic but no one will ever guess while you're wearing them! they catch the light beautifully and the delicate silver design compliments the gems perfectly. i always get compliments when i wear these. and you can't beat the price ",positive
" fossil watches are beautiful and have a lot of style. many people have pointed out at how different and nice my watch is. it looks great with almost all of my casual clothes. this is a beautiful high quality-not so expensive watch ",positive
" i bought this for my wife as christmas present. she loves it ",positive
" i bought one for my girl friend and she is very satisfied with it. it is really beautiful ",positive
" my son tells me that he loves his watch and would give it 500 out of 5 stars. he saved up for it and he bought it with his own money after his adhd and asperger's self had trouble walking home from the library one too many times when it was time (and after more than a few reminders). he'd also missed cello lessons at school and was very frustrated with himself for the difficulties he was having. it is a cool watch. it looks good it has two alarms (cello lesson and whatever else he needs) a stop watch and a countdown timer--that he's found a use for so far. it is waterproof/or resistant so that means when he forgets to take it off before his bath it's ok. this watch was a way that he could solve his own problems and reorganize his own life to make up for some of his difficulties. that's why i like it so much. it has all these features and looks really cool and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. that's the best i think. i'm not sure if he'll ever need the lap timer or the pacing feature or anything like that. i suppose those features are awesome for those who use them but for our purposes and our budget this watch is perfect ",positive
" this is a must have watch for serious runners. i have had mine for over a month and i love mine. i am a professional track and field athlete and i train very hard to win races. this watch helps me train better than any other watch i've ever had. it gives you up to 50 lap splits which are great for any workout that is over 800 meters on a track. not only that but it has 5 interval timers which you can set your appropriate rest time on. if you are a serious runner like myself i highly suggest you get this watch. it is definately something that you will need ",positive
" i bought these earrings for my stepmother in seattle so i never actually saw them. now she is a refined person with classy taste so you can't just get her any piece of junk. she said they were perfect and she loved them. that's a great recommendation! ",positive
" i have longed for gold hoop earrings for years. these seemed liked they were the ones! but i waited a while still debating..... finally 'went for it' and got a pair. i haven't regretted it at all. i find these earrings comfortable and i like the way they look on me. i am very happy with these and recommend these beauties!..... now if they would make them in white gold.......... ",positive
" nice watch for the price. case is a little bigger than some but a nice watch with easy to read face ",positive
" zina makes wonderful jewelry and that is why i am frustrated that they use such a cheap chain for this pendant. the pendant itself is beautiful and the silver shines but the garnet is very small. it is a nice red color though. i purchased this on sale and that is why it gets four stars and not three. ",positive
" i like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white. gold one is look like really gold ",positive
" if you want a subtle piece of jewelry that will get attention this is it! i have gotten more compliments and questions from strangers when i wear these (earrings and pendant) than i have from all the swarovski jewelry i have created and worn. this is a very different color than i have ever worked with; it appears as if two sides only are 2x ab and the other two aren't - quite unusual which makes it fun ",positive
" it was even more beautiful than what was shown in the display picture. my friend absolutely loved it. ",positive
" absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry. i bought it for a young man as a birthday gift and he has worn it every day since! unique and eye-catching ",positive
" i bought two of these (one for each daughter 3 & 6). it is very hard to find sterling chains in the length needed for children. thank you ",positive
" this necklace is just as advertised. i like it a lot. i was looking for an almost choker necklace. i would really like a wider one but this one will do ",positive
" its beautiful but the heart look large in the picture but in realty it's small but i think it's better ",positive
" this watch is you would expect from any timex watch. it's easy to read the face while running easy to set big button on the front for the light so no fumbing when wearing gloves for the little side button on some. it's lightweight if a bit stiff to start with but eventually easied a bit with age. i only use it for running timing not my everyday watch but i'll buy one again when i lose this one (as i usually lose them long before they wear out). i haven't had it long enough to notice any real wear in the band yet not sure if it'll wear out easier or not but so far so good (1 year) ",positive
" i got this watch to help me with running walking and yoga. it was a little difficult to figure out all of the set up but i am thrilled with the end result. i recommend this product to any woman looking for a watch to use for multiple workout programs ",positive
" thanks for the prompt delivery. great packaging. a beautiful watch--sleek and chic. perfect size for everyday wear and more active wear. great features easy to use. ",positive
" great features on this watch. i especially like the linked timers and the three alarms. my wrist is tiny and the selection of holes is great (i use the tightest). this does leave a gap because the band is still bigger than my wrist and the extra band wraps all the way around but it doesn't slip and it feels very comfortable. the alarm sound is pleasant. the color is great too ",positive
" this pair of earrings is a great deal for the money. you can't go wrong with a price like this ",positive
" its tough to beat the price of these 1/2 ct. diamonds for $199; they looked really good and the wife loved them. the only reason i gave 4 stars is because they only have non-screw backs and they didn't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got. but for the price a minor quibble... you won't be disappointed with your purchase ",positive
" . these are beautiful. at a total .50 carat for the pair each .25 carat stud is well matched for color and clarity. if you like white gold and diamonds you won't be disappointed. ",positive
" the watch is super thin; you barely know you are wearing it. in two weeks i have had over 10 compliments ",positive
" this is my third skagen watch. the design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light. the design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear. they have proven to be reliable timekeepers and i liked this one so much i bought two more for my sons. at less than $80.00 each they are a real bargin ",positive
" i've had two skagen watches and have to say they are my favorite. i love the large face and the titanium bracelet (you don't have to remove the watch in order to shower!). a lot of people have complimented me on the watch too. given the price and quality you can't go wrong. if you ever need a part replaced you just send it to skagen; the work is completed in a couple of weeks! in summary: an elegant watch at a reasonable price ",positive
" everyone loves this watch. i wear it for work and it's sleek enough to look sharp. women constantly compliment me on how it looks. ",positive
" i read the reviews about people saying their watch scratched and lost paint on it. mine has not done this with the exception of the clasp. since the watch and band are titanium it should be anondized meaning it's not going to come off. however the clasp and a few other small parts (watch hands) are made of stainless steel so they will start losing their finish after awhile. after wearing this watch for a few weeks i went and put on my old stainless steel citizen watch. it felt huge and felt like it weighed a ton. i went and weighed each of them. the citizen came in around 4.5oz while the skagen came in at around 1.5oz. it is also very thin i used to not be able to wear a watch since typing on a computer all day the band would irritate me have not had any problems with the skagen. one other thing to note the picture for this item shows the steel watch (you can see it on the face) if you want to see a picture of the titanium one take the product number and go to skagen's site or google. the skagen lost a star because of the paint coming off the clasp (not the band) ",positive
" my roommate got this for his girlfriend and after examining his girlfriend's ears i have decided that these earrings are great for the price. not something you want to give your wife but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young (or old) girlfriend with an entry-level nice gift. they are a decent size and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance. recommended ",positive
" the stones are a beautiful color and they're very pretty earrings packaged in a nice box. i recommend these ",positive
" i bought this pair to wear in my second ear piercing with a larger set of peridots in my first but i would also wear these alone. the pair i received are a lovely color. very recommended ",positive
" i am extremely impressed with the feel look and general quality of the watch. it contains the citizen miyota 21 jewel automatic movement that is a true workhorse for a fraction of the price. the comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet is worth the price of the watch. it has rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links the foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins as well. can easily be mistaken for a watch costing much more. the mineral glass crystal is scratch resistant - but not as good as a sapphire watch face but is less prone to chipping or shattering than a sapphire crystal. the display watchback is also mineral glass - displaying the undecorated miyota automatic movement. it look as stylish and run as well as my other watches and i receive as many comments if not more from the invicta's. it is a great looking watch! good value accurate and stylish if you like the sub' look. this is a good day-to-day knock about watch that still looks better than the quartz stuff in the same price band. if it lasts 5 years it's more than paid for itself ",positive
" i bought one as a gift. it looks great on him. but it ran out of battery after half a year and my friend need get it fixed. this should not happend for a new watch. as the watch was already started when i received it there was a possibility that it wasn't brand new when i bought them. other than that it is a good buy ",positive
" because i teach i wear a man's watch so i can keep my eye on the clock without seeming to look at my watch all the time. this beauty has a very easy to read dial. and it looks very cool and retro--i've gotten many compliments. i should probably have the bracelet made smaller--it's one of the bigger-sized men's watches i've ever worn--so i think it would be a great choice for big guys. i am quite pleased with my purchase. the price was nice too ",positive
" i've found that i receive quite a few compliments whenever i wear this necklace. great color combo & not too heavy. the price is right ",positive
" this watch is generally a good watch but there are some flaws in ours--not a surprise considering the price. one there is a white haze under the crystal when viewed in the sunlight--perhaps the result of careless manufacturing and cleaning. two my son has had the band come apart twice in one month. the later probably a design issue relative to all the spring-loaded retainers and such and the general range of movement of the clasp ",positive
" this watch looks great although i was afraid that it was going to be bulky. it has worked great for my husband. the only problem we have had with it is setting the date on it. no matter what time of day we set the date it is always the wrong date by the next day ",positive
" this watch looks like business. the movement is what i really like. you get about 5 ticks per second instead of 1 so it looks more sweeping (though i wouldn't call it sweeping). i give it a 5 based on looks and cost. i haven't had it long and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly (it was losing a few hours at night). i guess it just needed to get charged up. it's no rolex but it's no casio either.

" this watch looks and feels great on me. yes i had to take out about 6 links to get a good fit but that was fairly easy and only took 5 minutes (which included figuring out how to do it which i'll explain at the end). the clasp locks well - firm but not difficult to lock/unlock and is very secure. i was a little suprised with how lightweight the links/band is. that's the only part of the watch that feels a little cheap. don't get me wrong it's well constructed but it's not like a big manly steel band. at the end of the day i found that i loved it because it isn't heavy. i didn't give it a full 5 stars because after having it a few weeks there's a teeny tiny scratch that developed on the face/crystal. i'm really cautious and have been gentle with it so i'm rather disappointed this happened. (and it very possibly might have been me knocking up against a brick wall or something). if you're especially rough on your things this might not be the best watch for you. taking the links out is easy if you're not completely inept. you'll want something small and sort-of pointy (i happened to have had a filed-down mini screwdriver but a nail would probably work just as well). i found it easiest to first disconnect the standard clasp - just push the pin in (on either side) and wiggle the clasp apart. make sure you don't drop/lose the pin. for the links it's fool-proof - it has an arrow engraved on the back of the links showing you which side the pin/insert comes out. stick the nail/whatever into the small oval hole and pry the pin out the side. pull it out with a pair of pliers (it's in there pretty tight) and you can then remove the link ",positive
" the watch arrived in great condition it is a very stylish and affordable watch the only thing is that it is a tad too big and my boyfriends had to take some links out. he has a big wrist so it was a little unusual. nice watch though! no regrets ",positive
" pleased with this purchase. surprised how nice the watch actually looks ",positive
" this ring is just about what i expected. it's fun and puzzling and it looks nice. i figured it out after about 20 minutes of messing with it(i've always been good with puzzles so it might take someone else longer) ",positive
" this ring is absolutely gorgeous and i havent taken it off since recieving it. but when buying this ring be careful not to take the string off of the bands. this string protects you from well....insanity. i unfortunately took off the string and my ring separated into the 4 separate bands. luckily i found a website that gave me instructions on how to reassemble it. my dad put it back together and it was fine but i have to admit i'm a little distraut about how there is no indication or warning telling people not to take it off. if this does happen to you google puzzle ring solutions and there are many websites to guide you in restoring your ring to normal. ",positive
" i love this ring! it's interesting to look at and i like the design. i haven't taken the string off for fear of not being able to figure out the puzzle. maybe one day i might try it but i like it so much i don't want to chance it now. shipped fast ",positive
" this is a fun item to own i spent 2 days trying to get it solid again and had to look up the solutionon the internet. i think a solution should be included with the item ",positive
" i loved the wiccan protection knot pendant i purchased it for my daughter for christmas and she hasn't taked it off since. she had wanted a celtic tricetta necklace but absolutely adored this one just as much. thank you ",positive
" i was very pleased when i recieved this...i love that it doesn't look like every single other pendant on the market and although it looks like it in the picture it's not enormously huge. just the right size and very pretty ",positive
" i have been looking for a bracelet for what seems to be years. never found the right style/size/design combination to fit until now. this bracelet looks great on the wrist. it is well constructed and very comfortable to wear with no pinching; i'm giving it the full 5 stars without any hesitation ",positive
" this bracelet looks better than the picture. it looks beautiful on my wrist. the fifty bucks that i paid for it was a real bargain. i love it. there's only one drawback it's 8 inches long and that's too long for my wrist. if it fit perfectly i'd give it ten stars. i'll pay to make it smaller. it's made of titanium and maybe it's too tough to alter. i want it to fit over that knot on my wrist. if i can get it altered i'll wear it until the day i die which i hope will be 100 years from now ",positive
" i got this bracelet for my boyfriend. initially i was looking at two different designs but i'm really interested with this one. i made up my mind to buy this bracelet. when i received it i'm vary satisfied with it. it's really nice and the good thing is my boyfriend really like it. it's a worth buy. ",positive
" as a gift this bracelet will not disappoint. it appears just (or better) as it does in the picture. the only downside is that for a gentlemen with a thicker bone structure there will not be any give nor do they provide extra links to make it a bit more comfortable. otherwise one cannot go wrong with selecting it ",positive
" i always wanted a titanium braclet.and i found this on of all places amazon.com..i thought why not? i was very surprised when i got it this bracelet looks better in person! very high quality...the pic dont do it justice its a elegant design very contemporary and classy..it does not look gawdy orbling bling tacky..... treat yourself and pick this one up ",positive
" it is like a rolex daytona a very nice watch but with some difficulty to read because of it dial color ",positive
" beautiful watch!! i was already familiar with invicta and know that they're worth three times the price and that in the future they will be. had it in just a few days. don't let the picture fool you. it does not do this piece justice and you would be better off going to another site to view what this watch actually looks like...looks like it cost a whole lot more. i've been watching invicta's for about a year now and if you find a better price than this...it's stolen!!! ",positive
" this color was on a price special and i liked the look in the picture so i chose this model. i found that the silver on silver makes it a bit more difficult to read than i would have liked but it's adequate. good accurate movement as the other invicta timepieces i've owned or known of have also been. this one is quite heavy and has a feel of a more pricey timepiece. mine is running about 3 seconds slow per week which doesn't seem bad but former invictas i've had were a bit better than this. update to prior review.... now that the watch has limbered up the accuracy has improved and i've hardly needed to touch it ",positive
" i had one exactly like this one for over 20 years but finally the crown fell off. i am keeping it for a backup as it is still running just fine. i expect the same quality of my new seiko. i highly recommend this model. easy to read dial (especially the white face) and also a fine looking piece of jewelry ",positive
" extremely reliable easy to read looks like the rolex style only it is very lightweight. good for everyday use because you can wear either gold or silver jewelry with this watch. i would have given it 5 stars if it were one of those models which does not need a battery ",positive
" this item was very nice. the chain was longer than i expected and hangs really low on my neck but it only looks like the real one. you can tell that it is a knock off but you get what you pay for. for $5 i think that it was worth it but it does look different than the real one. good service and delivery ",positive
" this was a gift for my brother and he really enjoyed it. it was shipped quickly which is always a plus ",positive
" this invicta is a really nice watch but with some problems: all metal surfaces are polished on this watch so they scratch very easily and quickly. and the clock face is a bit too shiny in my opinion (hard to read in direct light). also who needs a 24h dial on a chronograph (instead of a 1/10s dial)? but overall for this price a good deal and good looking ",positive
" this watch is very attractive and keeps great time. it seems to be very high quality and i like all the engraving. ",positive
" this watch is attractive fairly heavy and well made (esp for the price). one small complaint is that the glow in the dark hands barely show up. 4 1/2 stars ",positive
" seller was delivering immediately. the watch itself is sporty but elegant suited for active men ",positive
" this is a beautiful piece of solid silver jewelry. well constructed and spins without burrs or sticking points. it is very pretty and a wonderful addition to my wardrobe. a lovely pendant that i will treasure always ",positive
" it was a gift and i was pleased with the good quality and workmanship ",positive
" great color and very well made. while small for a primary pierce in the lobe they are the perfect size for my second pierce. this company also makes beautiful 1/2 hoop earrings set with amethyst that i'm very happy with. ",positive
" the earrings arrived in a jewelery box so they would make a nice gift. the earrings seem to be well made. the post has a notch to prevent loss of the back. the ameythyst stone is so pretty---i've gotten a number of compliments on these earrings ",positive
" the watch arrived promptly and was exactly what i expected -- a very nice everyday watch for a good price ",positive
" i have been wearing this watch for last 6 months no complaints. loved the adjust-o-matic bracelet. great buy ",positive
" i bought 2 necklaces for each daughter for christmas. the girls wear them all the time they are very pretty and love opening up the lockets to look at the pictures we put them ",positive
" the bracelets were as advertised shipping was reasonably prompt. the only thing that i am slightly worried about is whether the elastic band which holds the pearls is strong enough to last for some time. these were not intended for me i bought them as a gift for my mother and i can only comment on its longevity only after she's used them for some time ",positive
" obviously the pearls are flawed but because of their size you can't tell even from a short distance away. they're super cute but i suggest getting them 2 or 3 at a time as they look a bit awkward on their own ",positive
" i ordered one each for my 5-year-old daughter and her 2 friends for valentine's day. nice pearl color and oval-like shapes. slightly too big for a 5-year-old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult. very dainty. a great buy for the price ",positive
" i will buy more items from you guys.i got them quikl ",positive
" i bought these pearls for my granddaughter when she was born in june. i bought my 2 year old granddaughter pearls and wanted my 2nd one to have pearls too. the pearls i purchased were exactly what i wanted ",positive
" i haven't worn pierced earrings in years;i thought they were sealed. when i discovered that they were indeed open i sought some simple gold post types to wear. when i saw my march birthstone set in a simple gold setting i couldn't resist it. the actual earring is so elegant! 'tis exactly as described and more! wearing such graceful simplicity in my beauty-starved lobes makes me feel like royalty! and for such a small price with the security of amazon! what a joy! sincerely miss agnes crosb ",positive
" inexpensive aquamarine is usually a washed-out blue color. not these babies! you'll fool your friends into thinking you've spent double ",positive
" these earrings are so exceptionally shiny and cute. the are a nice size and look very well made. a couple of small drawbacks: the pointy edges of the sunshine's rays are kind of sharp and also the hook part seems to be extra thin because a normal small rubber back does not fit and will slide right off but if you wear the earrings without a rubber back they will slide out and you will lose them (i know this because i had to backtrack in the grocery store only to find my missing earring in the produce section!). they do provide a rubber back that fits but it is so very very tiny that i could easily lose it and it's hard to handle with fingernails. but don't let those things stop you from buying these earrings because they are so distinctive and attractive. i always get lots of compliments when i wear them ",positive
" this watch is definitely something that i will keep with me for a while. it is simple elegant and came to me for relatively cheap. the free shipping is always a bonus and i also came across it in the gold box deals and when i saw it i knew i had to have it. it is pink and is lighter pink in the center. the bracelet was large with the extra links so i removed them and took it to the store to make it smaller. i think its a great watch for both casual and more formal settings ",positive
" great watch bought through amzon usa 10 days from order to receipt with shipping tracking along the way if you get nervous. aussie price au$890. amazon price au$510. do yourself a deal buy wht you can't afford in aussie through amazon ",positive
" watch is the best on the market. i've had it a month now and love it. the compliments keep coming in and amazon's price was the lowest i could find anywhere both on the net and at the discount stores. if you want to cath the ladies eyes this is the watch for you ",positive
" my husband loves this watch. he was so excited that it looks even better in person than the picture. as soon as he shook it the watch did exactly what it was suppose to and set itself to the right time date and month. he's absolutely thrilled with it. and i was thrilled with the price from this company. thanks all around ",positive
" this watch is beautiful. the picture don't make any justice. the quality from amazon is flawless. highly recommended ",positive
" my wife commented to me on the attractiveness of this watch something she has never done before as she doesn't own a watch and has no interest in them. it is a beautiful timepiece. what can you really say other than what is listed in the specifications. it works just fine and keeps perfect time. so what is my small criticism? there is a lot of gold and white coloring on the face of the watch and there is a lot of gold and white on the hands. the problem is that at certain times it is somewhat difficult to distinguish the hands from the background. if you have perfect eyesight this might not be a problem. my eyes are decidedly not perfect. gone are the days when i can surreptitiously glance at my watch while listening to some boring conversationalist. i generally have to bring the watch to about a foot from my face to read the hands. still it is a great watch and i feel compelled to give it a full five stars ",positive
" i have enjoyed the oregon series watch. it is good looking. the band is comfortable and is holding up nicely. the display is easy to read and the light is quite good. my one complaint is that the chronograph is often difficult to clear. i run a good bit and i was doing a workout the other day. i had to keep holding down the clear button to get the old time off. other than that i have enjoyed the watch immensely. i thought the price was extremely reasonable as well ",positive
" everything was ok. i actually recommend ",positive
" it's got an alarm stop watch timer lap timer 5 alarms actually a water break alarm water resistant although don't go aggressive swimming with it because water leaked inside mine and when it gets hot outside water vapor rises to the glass dial and it blurs out the time...but other than that it's a great watch finest i've owned in terms of digital watch i highly recommend it ",positive
" i bought this watch for my son a marine serving in iraq because he requested a sturdy digital with an alarm. this one had a large face which he says is extremely easy to read in any light especially at night. it is comfortable and sits close to the wrist with very little profile. he loves it and asked me to order a second one because he wants a back-up! ",positive
" atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the u.s. from the definitive u.s. atomic clock in ft. collins colorado. thus all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. casio makes -- and amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes including g-shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. but all atomic watches including this budget-priced waveceptor model are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. if you want a numbered-face watch that is always accurate this model is a real bargain ",positive
" if you are looking for an inexpensive yet reliable accurate & stylish analog (rather than digital) timepiece this is the watch for you. easy to set up & comfortable to wear. no backlight so hard to read in low light. a good buy ",positive
" i like this watch as it was pretty cheap and it keeps good time right with wwv time clock for the last couple of months since i got it. i am extremely hard on watches. the crystal is not hard so it is scratched already. the time is very accurate with the colorado wwv time station. for 30 bucks or so except for the scratched face is the only issue. worth the mone ",positive
" i wanted an inexpensive watch which keeps accurate time. this fills the bill quite nicely. it sets itself daily and even uses wwv's leap year flag so you don't have to worry about the daylight savings time change. it is a bit fussy here in pittsburgh (hill country). it took a bit of experimentation to find some place to sit it overnight where it will get a good signal. it instructs in the manual to sit it near a window with the six on the watch pointed at the window and to let it sit for up to 10 minutes. i followed the manual instructions several times. then i picked up the watch right after i initiated the manual search for the signal. i moved it around until it showed a steady 3 (highest signal level). problem solved. adjusting the band should be as simple as looking for the arrows and pusing out the pin etc. except it require brute force. i broke a jeweler's screwdriver and small punch in the process. i should have bought an expansion band at the same time ",positive
" this was a pleasant surprise for the money and the craftsmanship is quite good. only criticism is the adjustment of the band is a bit tedious. it is certainly worth while and a durable product. i would certainly buy this product again ",positive
" i am completely satisfied with this product. correct time is kept and it has been a great watch. i have had many atomic wrist watches and this is the best one ever. ",positive
" this watch is totally accurate. and with glow in the dark hands and numerals and an oversized date window it is the perfect watch. it makes it a pleasure to look at my wrist ",positive
" actually it's a fabulous watch. it looks great does everything that you would expect and is a joy to look at - i've swapped it for a watch that my wife bought me for a wedding present just to get used to it for a bit (which obviously she's less than pleased about) and everytime i look at it i see a really great watch that i'm really pleased i bought. however if there was a design fault it would be this: when you start and then stop the stop watch you cannot reset without pressing and holding the reset button; surely it would be better for a one-touch reset? also with the timer - loop 3 (which is continuous countdown) the reset button (again press and hold) resets the timer to zero (as you would expect the 'set' button to do) and the set button (press and hold) resets the timer to the original timer setting (eg 5 mins) - surely these are the wrong way round? all a bit odd but sort-of ok once you get used to it. seems a bit sloppy though in its design. nonetheless overall an excellent watch. i'm really please i bought it and it's very useful for triathlon events using the lap on the stopwatch ",positive
" my last ironman lasted 12 years of very hard usage in the restaurant business---lots of heat grease and water! my new timex combo dual tech watch has all the same features especially the timers which i can set at different intervals. you can't beat the price for this rugged but sleak looking watch. a plus---it has both digital time and good old watch hands ",positive
" this watch met all my requirements and it well suited for my hand. i liked the feature of turning the digital display on & off. the strap is also smooth doest hurt ur skin. the only negative remark i found with this watch is the indiglo night-light is not that bright as i expected or was not equivalent to my previous watch. ",positive
" i've had the watch for about 3 weeks and i really like it better than i expected ",positive
" this watch is great. it has full iron man functionality and actually looks nicer than a geeky casio - unlike prior iron man watches. i probably should have gone with the steel band as it could be worn out as well. it has solid construction and easy functionality. the indiglo could be a little brighter but i am sure that would cost battery life. ",positive
" i'm a wristwatch fan and i have a modest collection of nice luxury watches and i was looking for something inexpensive that i could use for rough activities where i don't want to damage my nicer omega or rolex watches. i wanted something with sport functions and alarm. most sports watches with digital displays (e.g. casio or even other timex ironmans) are pretty ugly they look out of place wearing anything but sweats and sneakers. but i was pleasantly surprised by this timex model. you can turn off the digital display and it looks like a reasonable handsome analog watch but one press and the display functions appear again. however there are some drawbacks: - the digits can be hidden by the thick hands of the analog display. - the white on black digital display isn't very clear except in good light. you'll be using the indiglo backlight often. the rest of the watch is pretty nice overall. the casing is heavy and thick but thanks to the comfortable rubber band i don't find the watch annoying on my small wrist. the loop on the band to hold the end of the band secure stays put pretty well. the overall weight is hefty but not as overbearing as some other watches with metal straps. the finish isn't exactly rolex quality it looks like what you expect a $50 watch the brushing is a bit uneven. the design is modern and smooth and the watch looks a bit more expensive than it is. the functions of the watch are pretty typical of any digital watch. there isn't anything about the watch i find confusing. as long as you walk through the functions once in the manual you shouldn't have problems doing it again later without the manual. usually you have to hold the top left button to go into set modes and the other buttons go up/down or advance the setting mode. i could completely figure out the watch without the manual. as for the sport functions the three loop countdown timers allow you to set up intervals. for example you can one loop to time running interval and then a second loop for the walk break. the chrono function keeps track of 42 laps and you can see each lap time in the recall mode. however because the hands can easily cover the digits i wouldn't suggest this watch if you really need to be able to read the digits at all times stick with a digital only ironman model the indiglo backlight just adds enough light to the digits to allow you to see the light in any lighting condition but as i said you'll more likely to use it in this watch because of the low contrast of the digits. the alarm is average for a digital watch it is good enough to wake most people when placed on the bedside (it isn't very loud worn on the wirst) ",positive
" the quality of the product is great and was just as advertised. the delivery time was excellent as it was promised for a week delivery but arrived the next day! great company to do business with ",positive
" my daughter loves this earring 'tree'. it looks great and is very practical as it holds multiple earrings ",positive
" this is a big watch for the price! (44mm i believe)....you have to buy a vintage dive watch to find one this large..... i agree with the other reviewer about the strap.i lost a casio just like this before @ the beach .i now have a waterborne dive-strap on my new one.....a one directional bezel & a screw-down crown would be nice on future models...also be ready to be asked what time is it? a lot when you wear it to the beach ...;) ",positive
" this model has been out for a long time. i like the look of the black more then the white or gold. the reason the watch loses one star is because the band. it looks great but the rubber will wear out and break in about a year. the replacement band that casio offers looks close the orginal but not exactly the same. i lost one of these and another was stolen. so the fact that i am on my third is a statement to how much i love this watch. i have been wearing it since about 1993 ",positive
" when i received this item i could not believe how beautiful it was. the price was insane for the quality and workmanship. i will order more for my sisters ",positive
" i bought this necklace along with 13 other hematite necklaces they are all absolutely beautiful and the quality is exceptional and the price is awesome you can not beat it. shipping and handling was very reasonable also. here is some information on hematite and why it is one of my favorite stones: hematite: element earth chakras: root (1st) hematite is the most effective of all stones for grounding oneself in the body and physical world. it can counteract spaciness and confusion helping one to see the practical concerns and move forward with useful action. hematite can be used to balance the auric field and align the chakras. it pulls stray energies down through the meridian sytem to the root chakra. hematite can help one see the silver lining on every dark cloud and the light at the end of every tunnel. it lends one strength courage and fortitude for moving through adversity. it is excellent for energetic support of recovery from any ailment of the blood and of blood production within bone marrow. it can work as a strengthener for the liver and can assist in the detoxification process.

" these earrings are very pretty-- not too big not too small just right. for the price you can't go wrong. the gift box they arrived in was sort of cheesy but they were for me so i didn't mind. if i were giving them as a gift i'd put them in a prettier box before giving them to the recipient. overall very pretty earrings good value no complaints ",positive
" i bought these and made a set with a necklace for my girl. they look gorgeous on her. really really worth the effort and unique. i highly recommend this seller. the reward i got for the gift... well let's just say i'm buying stuff from them in the future for sure! ",positive
" the earrings are gorgeous kind of a hematite color--but they look darker nearly black against fair skin. beautiful! and this company! the earrings went on sale after i ordered (and paid for) them and they automatically credited my card/account for the difference. wow! i am *very* happy with this purchase and will definitely buy from securehoop again ",positive
" i got this because it was a simple design but still looked good without costing too much. my only complaint is that my wrists are super small and i had to get links removed but that was no big deal. i only wear it when i need to dress up so it's still in good shape. ",positive
" these small earrings are great! i can sleep in them and because they are platinum i do not have any allergic reaction to the metal! i'm so glad i found them ",positive
" i received these earrings as a christmas gift from my sister. they are perfect. their size is about the circumference of a dime. platinum adds elegance and yet they are perfect for simple everyday wear. you know they will never tarnish nor will they irritate your ears. they are also perfect for young lady's first introduction to platinum jewelry. ",positive
" this is a really nice little pendant/necklace. the stones are not too small not too big -- the pendant is about 1 long. the bail is large enough to accommodate a nice chain (it comes with an 18 fine chain but you might want to replace it with something a bit more substantial). for the price i was expecting something a lot cheaper looking. i was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this.

" the pendant is gorgeous and feels substantial. quick delivery and the product was delivered as promised. the chain is a little long (for me) so the pendant hangs at about breastbone level but it's so lovely i haven't bothered to find a new chain ",positive
" i love this watch. it was my christmas present to myself. the ribbons are easy to interchange and i wear them with the silver bracelet as well. it comes in a cute and durable box that i now use to store all of my watches. a perfect gift and good quality. i especially like the little heart on the minute sweep ",positive
" this is the first time i settled for byzantine style of jewelry but i like it. it is a big and shining bracelet that perfectly matches with dark or black clothes. it would make an excellent gift for a man especially if the guy is not skinny ",positive
" i have received many compliments on the sterling silver byzantine bracelet 7.5. it is a nice size (~1/4 diameter). it is a beautiful link. it is a really nice peice: perfect for both casual and formal wear. the only things i did not like are that the bracelet is not totally cylindrical (it is flat on one side) and some of the links are welded together (not that this really matters because no one can see this). however compared to the byzantine bracelet i had had in the past it is fantastic. that one kept breaking apart any time it got caught on anything because the rings were not welded closed. the fact that these are (even if some are welded together) is a fantastic feature ",positive
" i own about 27 various expensive brands of quartz watches and finally decided it was time to invest in an automatic. i knew stories from other people who own them and claim that it's important to have a good watch winder so i saw this one and decided i'd give it a try. i could not see the point in spending hundreds of dollars on a winder when i could use that money towards another watch! :) i ordered this before i even received my new invicta automatic pro diver watch. i have very tiny wrists and because of that at first i did not think the spring loader was going to work for me. i struggled a bit to fit my watch in the holder but after about 15 minutes i got it. i have been using the watch winder off and on now for over a week and i think it does a great job. my automatic is only 1 minute fast and although i'm not sure if that speaks more for the quality of the watch or the winder all i can say is i think the product is doing what it is supposed to do and the watch is keeping time well. i put it on the winder each night before bed. it's fairly quiet but that is just my opinion. i have read other reviews where people said it was loud. i expected it to be louder than it is. like other reviewers i am unsure of how much is too much winding. i think most watches have a built in mechanism that prevents overwinding so i guess putting it in the winder each night is ok. my only problem now is the lonely empty space where another automatic needs to be since it is a double winder. hmmmm......time to get another watch! :) if you need a winder get this. it works well and you can save the extra money and get yourself another watch to add to your collection ",positive
" i went onto ebay and found the same product for slightly less but the shipping was outrageous! great product. clockwise or counter clockwise rotation. i have it in my office on the back of my desk and i can barely hear it working if i pay attention to it. nice design and looks good ",positive
" i purchased this watch winder as part of my husband's christmas gifts this year to pair with his new tag heuer carrera. i compared this winder to many others out there in all price ranges and this one is actually the same winder many luxury stores (ie. neiman marcus) carry sans branding. it's very quiet and the interval winding keeps his watches running without risking over-winding. you can save a lot of money by forgoing the leather wrapping or wood veneer packaging on the more expensive winders and just get this one. ",positive
" this dual watch winder is awesome. not only is it ultra stylish but it works great. although i have expensive tastes when it comes to watches i cannot justify paying more than $100 for a watch winder that no one will ever see. this dual watch winder works great with my tag heuer-link and my movado. it's truly a great buy no reason to spend more money ",positive
" i purchased this with a gift certificate for myself. for the price you can not complain too much- this necklace is a nice addition to my jewlery box. i suppose the more expensive ones may sparkle a bit more but this is a nice piece ",positive
" i purchased this necklace as a christmas gift for my sister. the pendant is very nice indeed but the chain is poor quality and seems like it will break easily. with a replacement chain the necklace turned out very beautiful though ",positive
" i love the watch expecially with the black white color. looks the casio of the old with a modern twist. the watch is very basic in design. a dual digital fully funtional chronograpgh watch. one other thing; it is very easy to set. the only problem is it is not back lit. so the digital part of the watch is useless at night (if incase you happen to be doing something in the dark at night).this is the only disappointing fact about the wrist watch. you might think a watch that cost $60 will have a self supplied light but it does not. sad. shame on casio. apart from that i love the watch ",positive
" i have bought this watch for him every 6 years. he has owned three so far. after replacing the battery it is not as water resistant. also the band has broken on two out of the three of the watches. i gave it 4 stars because of the degradable band. no other watch has movable bezel analog and digital time with an alarm for under $100.00. ",positive
" my wife brought me this watch as a christmas gift. i could not be more pleased. nice big face and rugged. decent quality. i may just get the gold or black version next. ",positive
" this is a nice watch and give accurate time. i gave only 4 stars because it took me a hard time to pull the crown to adjust the time ",positive
" lightweight great price self adjustable...this was the perfect gold toned watch for me! i shopped around and amazon had the best price for this watch ",positive
" it's a beautiful simple elegant watch. been eyeing it for a year never have seen it at such a fantastic price. job well done ",positive
" your service products and suppliers are the best!! excellent service excellent products and peace of mind when ordering. thank you amazon you're the best! ",positive
" this is a great looking watch. it is handsome and elegant. the face is large and easily viewed. the style is easily those you see in $1000+ watches but obviously does not have the engineering of the more upscale models. a real bargain for such a handsome watch. ",positive
" i am very pleased with this product and have had numerous positive comments about how sharp the timepiece looks. the dial is much larger than most watches but i have big wrists so it was perfect. the size also gives an updated look. the only negative comment i have is that the watch is pretty thick and binds on shirt cuffs but that is a minimal problem. great reproduction watch ",positive
" this pendant is small about the size of a dime and very light. it is one-sided - the opposite side is hollow. it appears exactly as shown. the chain it comes with is 18 which is pretty standard and has a circular clasp with the knob you have to pull on ",positive
" shpping items like these to an african country will always be scary but it arrived in very good condition. nothing was damaged and the chain and little black pouch was well picked. it was a surprise pendant for my girlfriend she expected just one item but this moon was well priced so i bought it with another pendant. you are lucky to get such beautifully crafted art at this price. it is strong so no need to worry about breakage during shiping. i like it and wish i could keep it but it was a gift. ",positive
" i was surprised at the quality. the bracelet and necklace matched perfectly. it was a great gift for my 23-year old daughter. she loved them ",positive
" my wife was surely surprised when she rec'd this gift now that she is in a retail lsdies shop. to dress up and add pearls looks fantastic. thanks well worth the price ",positive
" very beautiful pearls. there are visible blemishes which makes them appropriate to wear at work without me feeling overdressed. the uniformity is very good. all pearls are more or less same size. beautiful clasps too. however i have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help especially the bracelet. took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist. the color is slightly yellowish. the shape is good: kinda semiround rather than potato. they'll make great gifts. ",positive
" the set is absolutely gorgeous in person and i'm sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster. the clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design and it's incredibly secure when fastened; however it's difficult to maneuver and i can't imagine ever being able to put the necklace on - or get it off - without assistance. that's the only reason i wouldn't give this five stars - the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great ",positive
" my husband loved it great watch for a great price. does everything he wanted ",positive
" i needed a basic watch for time and running and this fits both well ",positive
" i purchased this watch expecting an inexpesive one which i got. but i recieved more than that it was cheap in price but definately not cheap in quality. my watch has held up to drenching rains and with stood the water resistant up to 50.00 meters label with ease. very comfortable easy to reset and has all the bells and whistles. i love it!! ",positive
" i love this item! i bought one for each of my bridesmaids as their gift from me. these jewelry rolls are beautiful and appear to be very useful in holding jewelry. there's even a place to hold your rings. :) ",positive
" i ordered for my grand daughters xmas present and she loves them... mission accomplished !!! ",positive
" i have recently bought this pair of earing and the matching bracelet for my son's care-giver. when it arrived my sisters and i were tempted to keep them for ourselves they were lovely. i particularly like the make and the feel of the bracelet. they are what i would term fun pieces but not in the least suggesting that they are for younger persons only. i am in my 40s and would enjoy wearing these pieces. it was a good buy at the sale price. oddly enough i also liked the packaging the items came in a regular protective brown cardboard box that protected the little gift boxes on the inside ",positive
" i was very pleased with the service of this seller. the earrings came within a few days and i love them. i have been asked more than once where i got them. thanks ",positive
" i like everything about this watch except the hands are hard to read in dim light because of the yellow background ",positive
" my husband is very picky. he loves this watch. he has gone through a lot of them and loves that it's dressy yet casual and can wear it anywhere. he loves that it's a substantial weight and the bracelet came extra long. he's 6'2 and large boned. had a watch repair shop take a couple links out for only $5. great investment ",positive
" i was honestly expecting some cheap necklace that felt like plastic considering the price. i was so very wrong! the necklace is gorgeous! the clasp is sturdy and not easy broke. package it was mailed in was also very good. i am able to christmas wrap it in the package provided. excellent service. thank you!! ",positive
" this is my second one of these winders so obviously i'm a fan. winds my rolexes and a few other eta autos perfectly but it doesn't seem to keep my seiko kinetic diver or panerais wound sufficiently. still as far as i'm concerned it spreads the lubrication enough to keep the watches in good health. for the price point this winder cannot be beat and i will purchase more in the future. the auto timer keeps the winder running cool. fairly silent rotation depending on the watch. while the gear rotations themselves are completely silent sometimes there's a slight shift of the watch as it goes around which makes a repetitive sound. nothing i can't live with. highly recommended ",positive
" i've read all of the reviews . i too own this model . it does what it was designed to do . burlwood is much more ....overpriced ? people sometimes need to be taken by the hand . especially the overpriveleged . you don't know what it's like to be rich untill you've been poor . and...you don't know how good your winder is till' you find the proper direction . as in all things others are not going to do it for you all of the time . but in this case i'll make an exception . some watches wind in both directions...you know - go both ways ? as do a lot of ....back to the winder lesson and some only go one way . find out what way you need to go and go there !...problem solved ( help me..this isn't working...oh please ! ) the moral too this story is in a plastic world try not to always have wood !! god gave you a brain . read my revie ",positive
" i bought this watch and it is cute but the face is smaller than the picture makes it look. luckily it was for my teenage daughter and not for me. cute though ",positive
" this watch is a great looking watch and the indigo light gives it all it needs to meet your everyday use. because of its gold tone and silver tone band you don't have to worry about what color jewelry you wear with it because it matches it all. well worth the price ",positive
" hasta este momento ha sido una experiencia muy favorable pues el reloj ha funcionado perfectamente y el tiempo de entrega estuvo dentro de mis expectativas. ",positive
" i wanted a watch with a metal band and a large analog dial. i wasn't quite sure that i would like this watch when it arrived. it was a women's style but it was larger than i thought it would be. i had to first take it to have some of the links removed but i was amazed at how light it was when i had it on. i love the easy to read face and the indigo feature is a must for any watch you own. i wear it everyday and i love it. it arrived with a brand new battery and the stem was pulled out so you knew the battery was new. i recommend this watch ",positive
" i am delighted to get my new timex watch. it is even prettier than its picture! it is easy to set too. i bought this watch for its looks and the larger dial so i am very satisfied. it will need links removed but one size just doesn't ever fit all ",positive
" i really like my new timex. it is very classy looking and the face is very easy to read. i like the date feature and the lighted face in the dark. the only drawback was i had to take it to my jeweler to have some links removed but the charge was minimal. all in all good value for the price ",positive
" i work in construction and am constantly having to replace my watches because of damage this watch is great because it is sturdy and can be clipped out of the way to prevent breakage ",positive
" this is a really nice looking watch. keeps accurate time. would recommend to anyone considering. did a lot of research and amazon had the best price with free shipping ",positive
" my trusty seiko of 21 years gave out recently (i should really remember to take it off when doing strenuous labor) and i went in search of a similar style. i received this replacement about a week ago and i love it already. it's light-weight and easy to read in the light or dark ",positive
" thanks ! i don't have any problem ! ill continue make deal with you ",positive
" great price. super nice watch ",positive
" the diamonds are real sparklers. they are simple for daytime wear and sophisticated enough for a night on the town. a good value! ",positive
" these earrings are a gift for the upcoming holidays. i think the person receiving them will really like them. they are a great color and are a nice size. i would totally recommend these. ",positive
" this is a very good looking watch. it goes with dressy or casual and it makes you feel well=dressed ",positive
" this watch was purchased as a gift and i was pleasantly surprised when i received it. the quality is excellent. i had read in another review that the watch was a little bulky but i found it to be in line with watches of the same type. this watch works well with casual and work attire and i was tempted to keep the watch for myself. in fact i regret not purchasing one for me to keep. buy with confidence. ",positive
" i got a really good deal for this watch and it looks great too very classy ",positive
" no complaints it's a nice change from a more feminine type of watch i usually prefer. very nicely priced at amazon ",positive
" i received this off my wish list from a dear friend and i must say it's stunning. it's both delicate and sturdy. the craftsman's shift is beautiful in what you would expect a piece to cost four times this amount. the stone is beautiful and large without being gaudy. it's a stunning piece of work. all you lads out there should buy this for you lass and make her very happy! wonderful piece i highly recommend for quality and price ",positive
" there isnt much i can say about this item just that the picuture doesnt do the item justice and the seller was great to deal with easy transaction and no problems ",positive
" this is a very nice ring i bought one for a gift and decided to keep it myself and ordered anothe ",positive
" very nice quality and reasonable pricing. this is a great place to see a variety of jewelry. my college-age daughter fell in love with the bracelets instantly ",positive
" just recieved mine today! its very beautiful. it is a weighty ring though and the moonstone is a but smaller than i thought it would be but all in all it is a great buy. ",positive
" i bought these earrings as a birthday present. they are very pretty. i am pleased with the quality and the price ",positive
" it's hard to tell the size of these earrings from the pictures; however they were about 2x the size that i expected. i couldn't have found a better gift than these ",positive
" i bought these earrings for my niece and after they arrived i immediately ordered another pair for myself. i find them actually nicer in reality than in the picture. the size is perfect and the amethysts although very small add just a little color accent. i bought them on sale for $15 instead of the usual $50 and i am very very pleased with what i got for the price ",positive
" nice watch. very simple. hands are very luminous. like the magnified date window ",positive
" there's nothing bad i can say about this item. it is by far the lowest price i've seen for something of this quality. and hey...she loved it. ",positive
" they are small but sparkly and look very cute. my 15 year old loves it and wear it every day ",positive
" prompt delivery. good quality. well worth the price. actually just the right size for all occasions. many complements on them. thank you kathi abbot ",positive
" she's out of state taking care of her cranky parents (mom damaged a hip dad is helpless when these things happen) and needed something to boost her spirits. she loved it--she prefers small jewelry so it was perfect for her. ",positive
" i use this watch both as a daily timepiece and for timing my runs. the ability to turn off the digital display gives it a refined look even for an ironman series. i like the catch incorporated into the watch band so it doesn't pull out of the guide (something that used to drive me crazy with my other watches). if you're looking for a sports watch that you can wear out on the town this fits the bill. ",positive
" timex ironman has been my kind of watch for long time now. great watch to wear anytime ",positive
" i found this pair of studs to be nice for everyday wear. they look much better than the ones found in macy's fine jewelry and they cost less. personally i would not go over 1/3 ctw with this quality because the flaws would become obvious. i am very satisfied with my purchase ",positive
" i love it. very nice watch! a little bit heavy but this is the way i like watches and the price is not that bad. ",positive
" this is one of the best watches available and i have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase at a real bargain price from amazon ",positive
" tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis - the times change and we change with them... this is a perfect watch and probably you won't change your time machine for a long time...simple and beautifu ",positive
" it is a good watch under $200 price range. if you buy it you will love it forever. one thing i hate is little bit heavy but not a big deal. :) ",positive
" my husband has really liked this watch so far. the price was great for such a elegant looking watch. he wears it when he dresses up. he really likes that it is kinetic. we don't have to worry about replacing the battery. the last watch i bought him was a fossil and we had to send it to their servicing center when the battery died and had to wait 4-6 weeks. the kinetic seems to be working out great ",positive
" this is a sleek sharp quality watch and the lowest priced model that i've seen in the arctura series. if you can catch it on sale i think its a great buy. however be prepared for the weight. this is the heaviest watch i've ever worn and probably the largest. if you're used to wearing stainless watches it will probably be fine for you. i'm used to leather bands and the weight difference is quite noticeable. wish i could find this watch in titanium that would be perfect. overall if you're not bothered by the large size or weight it looks great and i'm sure the quality is also. ",positive
" i really like the watch it looks good feels good on my wrist and keeps extremely accurate time (gains about 4 sec per month). the price of $[...] at amazon.com was very good compared to others i found in local stores or on the web ",positive
" the picture does not do this watch justice. it is a very sturdy watch with a nice looking all silver body and band. it does not look cheap at all! ",positive
" my husband just loves this watch and can't get over the great quality for the price ",positive
" item came to me fast. it is very confortable and very reliable. i don't have to worry a regular chain sticking in my neck or pulling my hair when the necklace moves. i highly recommend this necklace for sensitive skins or active people ",positive
" i like it beacuse you can hang almost anything from it and it looks good. the only downside is that the clasp is too big to get more delicate items on to it. ",positive
" i love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective. i contacted sabrina and they were great about sending me a new one asap with a label for returning the other one. that was impressive and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued. still the clasp is a product defect and i'm sure one of these days i will probably loose the bracelet b/c it comes undone unknowingly ",positive
" great set of earrings at a very nice price. thanks ",positive
" these earrings are so cute! they are a great size for a toddler but probably a little large for a small infant. it is so hard to find safety back earrings that are cute. these are a beautiful rose pink color - very sweet. ",positive
" my son needs a watch and this is ideal for him its cheap and it non breakable ",positive
" i rounded up from a 4.5. the shipping was on time. it was within the specification advertised but one of the diamonds is much more yellow than the others even without a hand lense it is visible. other than that i am very happy with the service and product. thank you jason bett ",positive
" great value and excellent quality. better than anything that i've seen locally. highly recommend ",positive
" we love the watch. it's totally adjustable press the button for glow-in-the-dark feature. the two lizards chase each other around the watch. too cute ",positive
" i bought this watch for my husband for his bday. it was a great bargain very stylish and he loves it. the only problem we encountered was w/ the so-called smart link band. it was supposedly designed for the customer to resize the band at home but after numerous failed attempts we gave up. we googled it and found several people who encountered similar problems solving the smart link mystery but no one offered a solution. even the fossil website was no help. we ended up paying a jeweler who sells fossil watches $10 to resize the band. other than that my husband is very satisfied with this watch. ",positive
" i wanted an automatic watch for a while and i was attracted to the green trim on this model. the watch is big and heavy. this is probably true of most automatics. my issue is that it seems to be too thick. i think the glass/crystal back adds a millimeter or so. the band has a slight problem that i can probably fix. right where the metal of the band contacts the case one side of the band has bent slightly causing the band to interfere with the rotating bezel. i may have caused this when adjusting the linkage or it may have come delivered that way. i think i could simply detach the band and squeeze it back into its proper shape. i have actually left it alone as i do not want the bezel to rotate and the defect is not visible. as far as accuracy it seems to have gained about 20-30sec in a week. had i seen the watch in a store and tried it on i would probably not have bought it. i was not happy when it arrived but i have worn it for a week and i am now glad that i picked it. the only other issue is that i wish the luminous markings were brighter. i purposely picked the black face to be easier to see the markings in the dark (as opposed to the white face) but i have had better luck with other watches ",positive
" i am a college student and member of the army reserve with knowledge of manufacturing/production processes. i value pieces of fine engineering precision and design. i have always admired automatic watches someday when i can afford one i will purchase an omega or rolex. i can tell that in my particular watch there is a minute dust on the hour hand and on the pendulum. first off this watch should be appreciated for what it is an automatic watch for a reasonable price. there are no batteries no electronics just gears and springs. some automatic/kinetic/whatever watches use a pendulum to charge a small battery these do not interest me. pros: automatic movement sharp visual appeal day/date function supposed shock resistance (haven't beat it up enough to know if this is true but i trust the claim having researched the manufacturing of the movement). see-thru case back so you can watch the mechanism do its thing! cons: it is not a rolex so don't expect perfection. the band and case are solid but lack the heft fit and finish of a rolex level watch. bottom line: if you want a truly automatic watch for about 100 bucks this is a great choice. orient watches and other invicta models are supposedly are just as good. you will get compliments on this watch ",positive
" i bought this for my husband. he likes the large easy to read numbers and says the expandable band is comfortable. a very nice watch at a reasonable price. ",positive
" bought this watch as a gift i was not disapointed another great vaule from amazo ",positive
" i am pleased with this watch. it is inexpensive yet has a lot of features. the only negative is that the band is a cloth material and not as easy to keep clean as it would with a leather band. ",positive
" i read the reviews for these earrings and i am very pleased with the results. i purchased my own pair and get plenty of compliments too ",positive
" really great quality for the price. the hinges are well made so i don't worry about them falling apart when i wear them. they are not white gold and diamonds. they are what they claim to be: silver and cz. i like them! ",positive
" as i said in my review of the bracelet (which i bought together) i thought from the pictures that they might be bigger however my wife was pleasantly surprised.they look much more expensive than they are. this is my first experience with cz but not my last (we're remodling a house). i recommend this seller for their shipping & quality of merchandise ",positive
" i bought this pair of earrings for myself over a year ago...when they were new to amazon (no reviews). i wanted something that looked pretty but didn't cost me a lot. i loved them....loved them so much that when i lost one down my sink drain i wanted to buy another pair. i am currently waiting to receive my second pair. for the price and the beauty why not! no one will know they aren't real diamonds ",positive
" i got this as a present after putting it on my wish list. i love it. it is really delicate and pretty. it's a little smaller than i thought it would be but still one of my favorite pieces of jewelry. ",positive
" saw the exact same watch in several jewelry case around town for $125 more. very satisfied with my purchase ",positive
" i purchased this watch on amazon after looking at the same watch in jc penny and dillards for almost $200.00 more. it's a nice casual watch i wear mine to work as a nurse and its very durable and attractive. the mother of pearl face is a pale pink so it doesn't clash when wearing other colors. for the price seiko watches are great mine usually last about 10 years of frequent wear getting wet regularly. ",positive
" after a good deal of shopping both online and in retail stores we are delighted with the product price and service through amazon.com -- i recomend this watch highly ",positive
" received the watch on saturday dec. 23 which was ordered thursday dec. 21 in the late evening. the watch is beautiful. thank you for the great service. ",positive
" i love this watch. it keeps wonderful time. i have a bigger wrist so i am glad it has a latch so it won't fall off. ",positive
" for the price. it is well made and solid. perfect for my kids ",positive
" i m very happy to buy in amazon shipping was perfect and on time. ",positive
" this watch is exactly what i was looking for. it is a small pretty functional watch that is quite durable. it has plenty of features but is not extremely complicated. the color is slightly lighter and more purpley then it is in the pictures ",positive
" the watch performs as advertised. atomic clock. i live 2k miles from ft. collins and the watch automatically syncs every night even if i don't put it near a window. solar recharge. the watch arrived with a low battery. it charged up to full after sitting in the sun for an afternoon. since then it has been on full charge with no special actions on my part. the watch is big and heavy. i take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand. the watch's user interface is unintuitive. this is the first watch i've owned where i had to read (and re-read) the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm. i find the timex interface and the old-style casio interface much easier to use. in the interests of saving battery power the alarms are short and quiet. i can't count on this watch's alarms to wake me up. it'd be nice if the watch had a power-hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations. all in all i like the watch. it is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn't run out of batteries. i wish the user interface was more intuitive the alarms were more effective and the watch was smaller ",positive
" the watch arrived in timely fashion and was already set up. this watch is super. however it lacks a timer. i left the timex ironman for this watch. timex's quality is horrid (a watch per year) and i changed to the casion g-shock based on a recommendation of a friend. i am glad i did. if they ever get a timer in this watch i'd buy another ",positive
" this watch arrived very quickly and it is a very fine watch. i had an earlier casio ceptor watch and the battery died i couldn't find anyone to replace it so i needed a new watch. by the time i had ordered this watch i actually replaced the battery myself in the old one. so now i have two atomic watches but the g-shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge. a great deal ",positive
" i purchased this watch as a christmas gift for my husband. he was quite surprised and pleased by the atomic solar features and replaceable watch band. the watch is a little bulky and fits a bit tight under his sleeves on his dress work shirts. overall very pleased and a great value ",positive
" i am in the army and because of that this watch has it's pluses and minuses. i travel the world so the multiple time zones is awsome. the time stamp feature is great for when i need help remember when a specific event happened. as for the solar power. it's great in that you don't have to worry about batteries but most watch batteries last close to five years anyway. in the army i find myself doing lots of night missions and i can go months without seeing the sun because i have to catch up on sleep during the day. well this doesn't really work with a solar powered watch. i get by but it can be a hassle some times. all-in-all this is a great watch and if you don't work at night then the solar power won't be a problem for you except maybe in the winter when you wear coats that cover your wrist. just take that into consideration when purchasing a solar powered watch ",positive
" i bought this as a gift for a friend and it was the perfect combination of brown leather for casual dress as well as the beautiful simplicity of silver to match classier wear. whether you're looking for something casual or more formal this bracelet wraps it all into one ",positive
" i never had a problem with minei'm a marine and the fact that i went trough combat with mine and held up made it worth the few bucks i paid for it.i go trough watches like they are made of paperhad this one for 2.5 yrs and other than a lot of scratches it works fine ",positive
" i'm ;logged in on my wife's accont. i never had problems with the band. i liked the first one so much that after i ran over it with my car i ordered another. if you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years you'll love it. it has a very intuitive design is lightweight and just works ",positive
" i bought this watch to replace an older similar model. it is simple and functional; perfect for being both a timepiece and a running watch. the functions are easy to use and the indiglo feature is crucial for nighttime training ",positive
" ditto to all the positive comments on the previous posts. however i have not had the problems with the bands like the many have mentioned. i've had two of these watches now going on third as the battery has died on number 2 and i have never had an issue with the bands on my first two. i wear mine all day every day even in the pool or shower and it's held up well. the light did go out seemingly too soon but then i notice the battery was beginning to fade as well at the same time. i wear mine all day every day in pool and shower and it's held up remarkably well. the only negative is that it seems the battery goes quickly ... but maybe that's due to using the alarm daily and training with it. it is an inexpensive watch (compared to many other options that are out there) and given its ease of use its very readable face and sleek look i'd take the chance on it ",positive
" this is my second sleek 50 -- the first was fine until the battery died then i tried to put in a new battery (bad idea)and managed to mess up some of the inner workings. highly recommended (the watch -- not changing the battery! ",positive
" i have three holes in each ear and i really needed some tiny diamond earrings for the top holes. these are wonderful! they are small but exactly what i wanted. such a great buy for this price ",positive
" i went out on a limb and decided to surprise my wife with these for valentine's day. i purchased the white gold version for her and to my great astonishment my wife was pleased by my jewelry choice - a first! they come in a smallish box with a smaller felt bag - that holds the tiny earings (the picture in amazon must be under a micron microscope!). they are tasteful and understated ",positive
" i love love these earrings. i bought them because i wanted a pair of earrings to wear all of the time. unless there is something special then i will change for a special occasion. but these earrings i wear in the shower ---- they are always shinning and they never rust because they are real gold. i received these earrings before the scheduled delivery date ",positive
" the earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me. i was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire. these earrings were much more flexible that the 25-year-old pair i was replacing. i doubt that the new ones are as strong and will hold up as well. however they do what i need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation ",positive
" excellent watch (eco-drive) i would spend the extra hundred and purchase the titanium ",positive
" i bought a nighthawk (although one with a leather band) about a year ago and i have been very pleased with it. it looks very masculine and classy and the style will certainly age well. the slide rule takes a little figuring out but it's very useful. it keeps time pretty well too. i've only got a couple of complaints: the leather band which i picked because metal bands have always been uncomfortable for me is a little too large for my wrist. even when i use the innermost hole in the band the watch is still kind of floppy. for the price the watch could have a sapphire crystal instead of a glass one. those conplaints are very minor compared to everything i like about the watch. i didn't want to give the watch five stars if i had complaints about it but my rating would probably be more like 4.75 stars. for the price it's a great value. ",positive
" this is my fourth (a fifth limited-edition is on order) eco-drive. i collect a lot of watches but these are some of my favs to actually wear and use. they are the most accurate watches i've ever owned bar-none. the nighthawk is solid well made and a delight to wear. there are few watches on which i'd change nothing but this is one. i also got an excellent price and great service. many thanks ",positive
" threaders are in and these are about the most elegant looking threaders i've seen. the stones are a nice size and it is obvious that it is a butterfly. it is nice to have such a refined option for such a hip style. ",positive
" i bought these for a friend for christmas as she is a butterfly lover.they ar beautiful. dainty yet elegant.she loved them. it was hard for me to give them up ",positive
" the earings look much better than pictured online. i received this as a gift and love them ",positive
" it is small and beautifull be sure you want a small one ",positive
" this watch is gorgeus it's a very big watch (it doesn't look so big on the picture) the screen can be set to black or red looks good either way. very confortable ",positive
" this watch changes the background color from red to black is great and the leather belt is soft but resisitance ",positive
" i purchsed this watch a while ago and i have to say it is simply great. the animated feature is simply the face switching between red and black which can be set to hold at either color which is a feature i have found to to very fuctional as it allows for me to switch to the color that better complitments what i am wearing. i have had this watch for nearly a year and it still gets comlpiments weekly. my only criticism comes from the fact that it is not like some of more of the trend watches that have a wide band that actually cuff around the entire wrist from which this watch takes its styling cues. nevertheless it is still a great watch that looks good ",positive
" this is a gorgeous and delicate looking watch. i can read it without my glasses and so far it works. i've had trouble with timex in the past so i hope this holds up well. it is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening ",positive
" classic style and leather too! the perfect little black watch at the perfect price ",positive
" i always wear timex and never have a problem ",positive
" this watch looks so sleek it wears well with day/evening wear. in addition it makes a great travel watch. i love the feel of the nice soft leather band ",positive
" i chose this watch because of the stunning and currently very fashionable 'rolex green' colour - and because the price was right. so how does it stack up? nice bright yellow display box to keep it safe during shipping and storage watch was well protected as well with clear plastic wrap over all surfaces. the quality and finish are excellent and the watch is easy to set for day and date. it has a clear back so you can see the motion spring mechanism at work - pretty cool. clasp and strap are well finished and work well - rotating bezel lines up perfectly at 12 o'clock - nice sweeping hand movement. great look and great value ",positive
" i love this watch and i love the price. it looks good both casual and dressy. it goes with just about anything. the people at invicta are really right in that you should try to match your watch with your belt and such. the material is high quality. i have large wrists so it's tricky to get on and off initially because the leather is quite stiff. but it's been loosening and so it's much easier now ",positive
" i have had this watch for a few months and so far it has served me well. it is very solidly built and has survived a few falls already. it is accurate enough to get me to work on time. i do have to wind it about once every week or two mainly because i don't move my arm enough i think. note that this watch is fairly big (on me anyway) and the strap is quite stiff when new. it has started to loosen up now that i have had it for a while. i like the look and i think it is dressy enough to wear with a suit but still casual enough that it doesn't look out of place with jeans either. a reasonable price for a decent watch ",positive
" i very much like these earrings. my only reason for not giving them a 5-star rating is that the topaz is quite small. you really have to look closely to see it. but they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful. i recommend them just be aware that the stones are tiny ",positive
" my boyfriend got me this watch for valentine's day and it is gorgeous! the face is very small as other reviewers have indicated so if the recipient likes smaller face watches (as i do) this is a great gift. it looks more like a bracelet than a watch; good for small wrists. elegant-looking & classy. i love it! ",positive
" this is a tiny compact watch with elegant design. it is fit for the women attending the formal parties. plus it works great. this price deserves its value ",positive
" this is a very nice watch. it is smaller than it looks in the picture but i actually like it better that way--it is delicate and lady-like. the pink face is subdued and the steel band is polished. it makes a nice dressy or everyday watch. i have seen similar seikos in the stores for much more money. ",positive
" my reaction is quite similar to the other reviewer. i received my watch a few weeks ago (only took three days) and was impressed by its classy look---all my other casios have been basic black clunkers. i like that the toggle switches protrude so it's easy to activate them---those old recessed ones drove me crazy trying to get a nail or golf tee in there. it has all the features i wanted but i had the same reaction about the alarm. it's less assertive than the other casios i've had and i don't think i can trust it to wake me up early or if i'm tired. i've already decided to buy an inexpensive alarm to put by my bed. because the screen showing the digital data is small it's not always easy to read what's on it especially if the watch hand is partially obscuring the screen which somehow seems to happen a lot. the back light only goes on one second at a time and isn't very strong so there's a good chance that you won't be able to read the digital screen that quickly. fyi the 10 year battery claim is based on using one second of backlight each day so you better look quick and look sharp----but not often. so.......great looks but personality could be better. that's life ",positive
" bought these as a christmas gift and think think they are adorable! great for a second or third hole to add a splash of color. possibly perfect for a young daughter's first hole. the stones have a very nice sparkle. wasn't sure if 3mm would be too small but i think these will do just fine. this set came individually boxed but in a clear plastic holder so that you can easily give as a set or break them up for individual wrapping. for $49 i'm very satisfied ",positive
" i am very pleased with the locket. it is a nice size but not too big-definitely large enough to be engraved. the chain is pretty and appears to be strong. it arrives in a lovely black velvet pouch and box. my daughter was delighted with it ",positive
" someone near and dear to me loved it...and the price was right! valentine's day is coming...it makes a great gift ",positive
" i bought this necklace after reading reviews about different types breaking easily. this one is very good so far and my wife loves it. for the price i paid it is a great product ",positive
" this necklace is beautiful. the chain is not skimpy and the heart locket itself is really pretty. a great alternative to an expensive locket at a fine jeweler. a true steal at a sale price of under $30.00 ",positive
" i thought this was a very pretty lil keepsake. i think simple is very nice and it's simple in design and what not. plus it's not too expensive and as a thoughtful gift it will win lots of points ",positive
" i bought this locket and got it engraved with my sons name on it(caden) it looked great. you could fit 5 or 6 letters on it. it was a good locket ",positive
" i believe the heart shaped locket is a one-of-a-kind thing. it is appropriately sized to allow for sufficient size pictures while not being too large. the silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures. due to the size of the locket a dainty smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket. therefore while i was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews i took a risk and am happy with this purchase. the pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection. good gift. sincerely the guy who usually blows it on the valentine's day gift. ",positive
" a really beautiful watch with very very nice casing. adjustable strap which fix easily on my 4 and 8 year old children. they love it ",positive
" the facets make the chain quite sparkly. i found it perfect for all my pendants not flimsy but not too heavy and not twisty like some other type chains. ",positive
" this is a nice chain with a durable lobster claw clasp. the diameter is somewhat small but i will probably order another chain with a larger diameter ",positive
" i am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase - the earrings were more beautiful than i expected - i will definitely purchase jewelry from amazon in the future!! ",positive
" these came in great condition and with a nice box to store them in! they are very pretty but if you don't like heavy earrings these won't be for you ",positive
" the product arrived quickly and without a hitch. i really liked the earrings when i saw them. they were better than expected. i'm very pleased. thank you. ",positive
" i had seen the gold/orange face version of this casio watch for years but didn't know it came in black (and white) until i found it on amazon. i really like the classic good looks of this watch... nice rugged case smooth-clicking rotating bezel sturdy band etc. for &lt;$60 this watch truly delivers awesome quality and value. the digital features are great too. i've received a few compliments from co-workers on this watch already. overall an awesome watch for the money and i couldn't be happier with it ",positive
" i've owned this model for about seven years and i think i'll buy another to keep on standby in case i break the original (i'm not gentle with my watches while working/playing). tough pretty easy to set good features and classic diver style at a great price. what's not to like? wouldn't mind having a light on the lcd otherwise it is proven a great investment. battery lasts ~2 years with the alarm going off every day and watch band life is about the same (cracks develop after a while). no corrosion (duh stainless steel) and good resistance to scratches on the crystal so far. ",positive
" a great item i received the watch box storage chest very quickly and was very happy overall with the purchase. it was as described in perfect condtion and a great buy too ",positive
" this is a beautiful watch storage box. great value. my husband is a watch collector. plenty of room for the large invicta and croton watches. nice design and color. a must have for anyone with a extensive watch collection. ",positive
" my husband has become an avid watch collector so i gave him this box for christmas. the design of the box is as attractive as its contents. my husband says that it is easy to use too. from the looks of things i will have to get another box for his ever increasing collection ",positive
" beautiful box to hold most of my watches. have two other watch boxes that hold 11 watches ea and some rings. this box holds those watches in less space! having no place for the rings is not a minus in my opinion. nice being able to see 10 of my most worn watches at a glance! another 10 in the drawer below. if you have several watches that you want to put in a nice looking good quality box you will not go wrong buying this item ",positive
" this is a real nice-looking box. i'm expecting great leaps in organization for all my wrist wear. tech swiss also receives an a+ for getting this out to me so swiftly ",positive
" this is an outstanding purchase at a great price and quick service and delivery thanks amazo ",positive
" i love all of the bracelets that i've purchased from this vendor. they are cute and inexpensive... also i've recieved so many compliments on this bracelet. i'm very pleased with this jewelry vendor ",positive
" i have bought several of their braceletsbut this one has a special quality to itit looks so expensiveand is so prettymatches everythingwhat can i sayi guesss the lord was good to mefinding this at a price i can affordthe first time i wore iti got a complimenteveryone wants to know where i got iti love this bracelet ",positive
" i bought this watch a couple months ago and it is superb. it is a big watch but i am a big man and it looks quite hansom on my wristbut if your not a big guy i woudnt recommend this model. now onto the timekeeping.when i received the watch it ran a bit fast (30 sec. daily) so instead of waiting the 6 weeks to sent it to seiko for repair i took it to the local seiko dealership/jeweler and had them regulate it for $30 well worth the money and now it runs great. this watch is an absolute tank i wear it every day it gets banged around quite a bit and there has yet to be even the slightest scratch in the hardlex crystal. ",positive
" i love this watch i thought by looking at the pictures and reading other comments that it was going to be big and bulky. i was immediately surprised at how light it was. it is easy to read and keeps good time. it is also a very handsome watch. the rotating bezel is a quick and easy way to time anything (lasting less than a hour). highly recommended! ",positive
" i received the product early and was just what i expected. nice packaging and great product. i would buy again... thanks amazon ",positive
" oddly the skx175 i received is actually a skx009k! what a steal at $129! the watch is a 5-star based on price alone. but the jubilee bracelet gets a 1-star!! it's cheap feeling and loose. the center links are fold-over not solid. at this price though it's not surprising that something got cheaped out like that. overall i give it a 4-star rating. missing tag!!! false advertising (perhaps to the benefit as the 009k is perceived a little better) that it's really a skx009k rather than a skx175 (has singapore labeling on lower edge of dialface whereas the skx009k does not have any country markings). great buy for sure!! cheers ",positive
" this watch is a classic. i have no issues with it losing minutes. i am very tough on watches i never take them off and this watch has been a real tank. i was needlessly worried that the red and blue dial would chip or be scratched off. i am amazed that it has not b/c i have accidentally scraped smashed it into doors walls etc...same for the dial tough as diamonds. it is a big watch so it may not be for everyone but if you like the styling it is a steal. and the seals will never weaken b/c it will never be opened to change a battery. i am very impressed ",positive
" i love the look of my seiko. it's the best for the money. i will buy more seikos in the future. it's a great product ",positive
" i had my order within 48 hours! product was great as well !!!! ",positive
" i will purchase again from pugster. the only negative is it took a while to get here once i ordered but the quality is great ",positive
" this necklace came exactly as pictured with a nice big blue box to store it in. i feel it was a great value for the money. i would recommend purchasing if you like topaz jewelry ",positive
" these are very well crafted little earrings. i love how they look and the price just can't be beat! these have made me want to buy many more things from silver insanity! the only problem i did experience with these earrings is that the post is rather long and it pokes the side of my head when i sleep. otherwise i couldn't love them more! ",positive
" as a tarantula keeper (i have 5 at home) i always try to look for unique items such as these. caution- they are really tiny! i've already lost one of them. (guess it scurried away) it's nice to see that they actually look like tarantulas and not true spiders ",positive
" pros: the blue topaz stone is beautiful with great quality and great cut. the white gold is a perfect choice to combine with the blue of the stone and the diamonds. cons: the chain is kind small and thin. the diamonds are tiny with less than good quality. overall: i am a pleased customer. i bought it as a gift for the topaz stone not for the diamonds or the chain. by the way she looks stunning with this necklace ",positive
" i was kind of worried when i read some of the other reviews for this but i'm so glad i ordered it! it is sooooo much more beautiful in person than in the picture. it's wonderfully sparkly and just the right size. it did take a bit long to ship but it was worth the wait ",positive
" this is such a gorgeous bracelet! i'm glad i ordered it for myself. ",positive
" very pleased with this bracelet. the crystals are gorgeous. it is a wow bracelet ",positive
" when i received this bracelet i was absolutely knocked off my feet!! it is larger than it looks in the picture and is absolutely stunning. ",positive
" needed a gift for my mother in law who has everything; including great taste. she collecgts the swarovski figures but didnt have any of their jewelry. i came upon this accidentaly and took a chance on ordering it. it arrived promptly; in time for christmas; and it is very stunning. not gaudy at all; just classic style beauty. could probably be worn to her office each day (upscale casual) or if she is dressed up. the price absolutely could not be beaten for what you are getting. i liked it so much i wanted to get one for myself; and i am not a huge jewelry fan ",positive
" service was great ring is beautiful and of good quality it was set promptly ",positive
" this product has helprd me to easily open the back of my watch and replace the battery. i am sure it will satisfy me when i want to change the battery on my more expensive watch that has the back that screws on. but also since i have n scale model trains the tweezers and small tools have been most helpful. i.e pliers hammer etc ",positive
" this is a good collection of tools that you should have if you want to do minor watch repairs at home. i had 5-6 watches lying around and i could not use them coz they ran out of battery. was able to open all of them with tools in this kit. it doesnt have any user guide but if you have used tools then you will be able to figure out where to use what and how. the quality of products is pretty good too .. at least nothing broke during fixing 5-6 watches yet. i am very happy with the purchase. the hammer was missing from the kit and when i called the customer service they immediately sent me the hammer ",positive
" this is an excellent tool set for beginners. the quality of the tools is not professional grade but more than adequate for the hobbyists. for the price you pay this is an excellent deal. a little more money than some of the other kits being sold on amazon.com but well worth it as you get a complete set ",positive
" i love the workmanship in this piece. nicely done and silver insanity has awesome customer service ",positive
" i bought this necklace because it was very on sale and i was surprised by how much i loved it when it arrived. the beads are actually somewhat darker than they appear in the picture which looks nicer and is easier to match to an outfit. it's a bold necklace but it can dress down quite a bit with the right blouse ",positive
" i was browsing through amazon when i came upon nvie jewelry and i absolutely love it! i bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday but had a hard time not keeping it for myself. the necklace was really nice well constructed and it was shipped quickly. it looked just like the picture but i have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one-of-a-kind.i would recommend nvie designs to anyone for buying really lovely affordably priced jewelry. ",positive
" i have had many compliments on this watch. i have the satisifcation that it cost much less than a jewelery store. ps... it's also my dive watch ",positive
" what a great buy! beautiful and high quality watch for a great price. it is probably an older version of the seiko coutura watch but it really does not matter. ",positive
" this watch is very rich looking. the price was phenomenal! i saw this for sale at other retailers for $300.00 plus! i have received numerous compliments ",positive
" the watch is very pretty sturdy enough for everyday wear and elegant enough for dressy occasions. excellent price and fast delivery. i like the dual tone watch band because i wear both white and yellow gold. the gold isn't as brassy as what shows in the picture. excellent value ",positive
" i purchased this as a gift for mu niece and she thought it was so pretty. she liked to weight and she says it is staying nice ",positive
" very nice piece just beware of the size it's much bigger than it appears in this picture. it does hang nice on the silver cord however the clasp is backwards and with the cord it does not flex to the correct position. ",positive
" i bought this gift for my sister-in-law and it was beautiful. it is high quality and looks great. ",positive
" i just received this today. somehow i completely missed that the pendant is on a silver-wrapped wire and not a chain. had i noticed that i probably would not have ordered this piece - and i would have missed out. it is very nice. it has a nice weight to it - not too heavy but substantial. the wire lays on my neckline just right and the pendant looks beautiful. i'm very pleased with it. ",positive
" this is a beautiful piece. very substantial and unusual! the only thing that would have made it better is if it had been made with a bigger bail so it could accommodate larger chains than the neckwire it comes on. regardless it was well worth the price ",positive
" i was impressed with the quality of this pendant including the packaging! i've received several complements on the quality and unique design. for me it signifies john 15:5 i am the vine and you are the branches... i am very pleased with this fine piece of jewelry. thank you ",positive
" this is an excelent machine. pricsie timing and wondeful design. i will recommend it to any lover of good watche ",positive
" this invicta is a great watch if you are looking for a giant size timepiece with a touch of elegance. it is well designed and the fit and finish is good. the citizen automatic movement is a workhorse and very reliable. when you open the box this watch will impress you and everytime you wear it it will be noticed. it is not for the timid. comments and more information can be obtained through the www.invictawatchforum.com. see what others think and general watch information ",positive
" my sister loved her necklace. she was very pleased with it and so am i ",positive
" it's a beautiful pendant...the stone is genuine and very beautiful. i love it ",positive
" it's pretty but functional. my daughter wears it constantly and can roughhouse around in it and it's safe ",positive
" am very pleased with my purchase speedy shipping will use agai ",positive
" great ring for the price. it is very pretty on the finger and comfortable not too heavy ",positive
" i love this ring! nice and simple goes with my skin tone great. i use my hands a lot at work and this thing hasn't scuffed yet! great buy great price. will definitly buy from them again! ",positive
" never off time never wind never re set the true lazy person's watch ",positive
" exceptional value for the money! the watch is beautiful and the recipient was particularly impressed that it had the correct time and date upon his opening the present. no more watches that say the 31st on the 1st of the month ",positive
" watch is a very sturdy and water resistant time piece however the resin band is very uncomfortable at times ",positive
" i have had this watch for two months now. i have been working hard for these couple of months banged the watch around. it is still scratch free. working outside on the car and the battery fully charged. and has stayed that way since. of course i was not working under the hood that day. this watch is very bulky and although you should not work under the hood with a watch on it would be really bad. the watch comes a full .75 above the wrist. the atomic part works great. i live in delaware and my home seems to be in a void of most radio wave yet i get an update while i am sleeping with the watch on. simply a tough bulky watch that should not have any trouble getting the atomic time and charging the battery. the lcd is to small to use any of the other features except maybe the alarm but dont get this watch for any other features ",positive
" the charm itself was slightly smaller then expected but for the price it was fine. shipping time was good ",positive
" i received these earrings as a gift and i don't know what they are made of but i get an awful lot of compliments on them. they seem to change color in response to what i am wearing. i would definitely order other silver insanity items ",positive
" the earrings were a gift and were most warmly received! they were a real hit! ",positive
" i have two pairs of earrings from this company and they look amazing. i can't tell if they're plastic or glass but they really do look as beautiful as in the picture and i always get compliments when i wear them. sometimes people ask me what stone they are they can't even tell it's synthetic!! no bubbles or anything like the bad review here says ",positive
" these are dainty and somewhat small but lovely to wear to work. diamonds are a nice clear quality. ",positive
" these are so danty and comfortable to wear. was an excellent price as well. thanks for the offer ",positive
" arrived timely a bit smaller than i had envisioned but beautiful and comfortable to wear ",positive
" these earrings are perfect to wear every day: * they are comfortable to sleep in - no need to take them off in the evening * they are small and classy - will look great with any outfit they are exactly what i was looking for and i'm really happy with them. to help you see the size of these earrings and how they look on someone's ear i've uploaded an image of this earring in my ear - see it in customer images ",positive
" this is my second casio watch of this type. the watch is maintenance free adjusts itself every night and takes care of daylight savings time. ",positive
" i am pleased with the watch. it is flashy and keeps good time. however i am still trying to figure out why it stops from time to time. i think i inadvertantly push a button that stops it. it is a small annoyance but has happened 4-5 times in the last month ",positive
" i've been through generations of digital watches with plastic bands. my wife thinks they look nerdy but i like the alarm and other gadgets. i'm tired of wearing these things out though and wanted something that looked nicer. this is a very nice looking sturdy watch which was what i wanted. it also has the window with the digital time date alarm etc. my only complaint is that that window is tiny and not easy to see. also the light for night viewing is wimpy. the watch works fine and is very nice looking but i wish the window were a bit larger. one year later the digital window keeps setting it self back to jan 1 and 12:00 noon. poor quality. look elsewher ",positive
" this is the second of these watches that i have owned. i'm tough on watches and i had the crystal replaced on my first one but it leaked and moister got inside - still runs fine just tough to see. the flat crystal on this watch could be just a hair more recessed and then there would be little chance of chipping it on the edge. this watch has an lcd that supports an alarm its own time separate from the dial stop watch and date. this combo is getting more difficult to find but is ideal for traveling and keeping the dial on home time and the lcd on local time (so alarm goes off relative to local time). to find this in a seiko or similar watch you will spend north of $100 and more like $200. getting this watch for $70 with free shipping was a no brainer. i paid $110+tax or so for the first one five or six years ago in a department store ",positive
" i totally love this necklace. it goes with many things i own and really enhances a low neckline. i get compliments each time i wear it ",positive
" it's a good value for anyone with no time and a small budget! five stars for value ",positive
" i purchased this as a gift for my secret santa and she wore it a week strait ",positive
" i bought this watch on amazon for my husband who is an avid runner and he loves it !! he sometimes has difficulty with the heart rate while running because of sweat (so he says) but otherwise no complaints (and he can be a tough critic) ",positive
" my husband loves the big face on the watch that's tilted for easy viewing while running. he never takes it off - even in the shower. the heart-rate monitor reads clearly and easily ",positive
" but no calories count. i love this watch despite that it's well designed the chest strap also links to the machines in the gym (most that say polar ready).. so that was a great surprise the chest strap has a battery that is user-serviceable as well as the watch so you don't have to send it to the manufacturer (like the polar hr). overall i think is a good buy but the is missing the calories count that would be my only upgrade. ",positive
" i purchased this for my wife on christmas. she loves it. looks wonderful though it is smaller than it appears in the picture ",positive
" i bought this for my boyfriend as his valentine's day gift. he loved it! it 's a great price for this watch as well. ",positive
" are you tired of replacing watch batteries? do you bump into things with your watch? if so buy this one. it's a beautiful practical watch that's available at a very good price. it winds itself mechanically as you move your wrist about. no batteries. it's shock- and water-resistant. bang it around swim with it wash dishes with it shower with it. no problem. it's gold-plated stainless steel with a gold-plated stainless steel band. it's beautiful. it's big so if you have small wrists buy the ladies version if not buy the men's version. ",positive
" this dainty heart looks absolutely beautiful on. it picks up the colors of your clothing. it is an amazing price for such a beautiful pendant ",positive
" for the price - this is a great buy! colors are good - has a nice weight to it! would buy more from this merchant ",positive
" the review below by owen wilson is pretty funny. he never took it out of the box and it stopped running so he returned it. lol! it's an automatic watch dude! you have to wear it to wind it or it stops. anyways i've had mine for about 4 months now and barely ever take it off. it keeps excellent time gaining only a second or two a day. i really like having this wonderful piece of classic technology on my wrist i like the size and substantial weight of it and it's very comfortable to wear. i took a star off the rating because the original strap developed an unpleasant odor after a couple of weeks which no amount of scrubbing would remove. i replaced it with an after-market italian rubber strap. 3 months later the new strap still smells pleasantly of vanilla which i guess is a common additive in real rubber straps. who knew? the original strap looked a bit beefier and more diver-like but the new strap has a deployment clasp which is handy. occasionally i wish i had bought the skx007 instead as i like the look of the round markers but it hasn't bothered me much that these are square and i prefer the second hand on this watch. i really like the way sat is blue and sun is red - reminds me it's the weekend. this is my first modern automatic and overall i'm very happy with my purchase. ",positive
" i purchased three of these hearts bracelets for my three daughters for christmas. they are very pretty and they loved them. the quality is good for price. ",positive
" great item don't go looking for huge diamonds but it looked good over all. and my girlfriend loved it so i guess that's the most important thing ",positive
" lovely little apple charm. just what i wanted. picture a little deceptive though. i thought the charm would be larger than it actually was. otherwise - great item. i'm happy ",positive
" the 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch. i'll just say it fits very well on my relatively small wrist. if you like the watch but think it won't fit well because you have small wrist. don't worry it fits just fine. enjoy. after wearing this watch for few weeks i realized i am just like many others wearing the calibre 2100 exclusively now. ",positive
" great looking watch and i shopped around for the best price for about three weeks before i ordered from amazon. shipped lightning quick also ",positive
" overall the product is great. i have had the watch for nearly three months now and have had no problems with it. the quartz movement is very accurate the chronograph works very well and i use the alarm every day. the only drawback is that you have to reset the date on months that are less than 31 days. otherwise this watch is fantastic and with the eco-drive you never have to worry about repacing the battery. and the titanium version is so lightweight that you hardly notice that you are wearing a watch ",positive
" i got this watch some couple of months ago and absolutely loved it. it looksfeels and functions really good and got lots of positive comments from my peeps. now for the reason i cant get give it a 5-star (i really wish i could); it does not have perpetual calender. i was looking for a watch with all of the 2100 qualities and also with perpetual calender. i hate the fact that i have to manually adjust my watch and painfull enuf i have to leave with this flaw. if you dont mind a watch without a perpetual calender then you would love this watch and literally bite the finger off of anyone that puts their finger on it but i want a watch with perpetual calender and this doesnt not fully cut it for me. ",positive
" very high quality watch i recommend these to all luxury-fans works without any problems my old citizen chronograph are working for over than 12 years by now daily used ",positive
" i have banged my watch against all kinds of hard surfaces and am pleased to say that this thing is built tough. everytime i've accidentally hit it against a counter top or wall i worry that i might've scratched it but everytime (knock on wood) it's come out clean. another good thing about this watch is that it's light. for a big watch it doesn't weigh me down like a stainless steel model. i've gotten many compliments on it. i love it ",positive
" this watch is beautiful. i cannot say enough good things about this watchs design. its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy it keeps perfect time and is very light weight. i bought the calibre 8700 before this one and i love both of them but i would give this one a slight edge. my two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the calibre 8700 does have and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not saphire. i am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as saphire crystal would be ",positive
" this item is exactly as advertised. well designed well made and heavy. my only complaint (and the reason for the 4 stars) is that the chain is way to short. i knew this when i ordered it so i had other arrangements made but a 26 or 28 chain would be much better in my opinion than a 20. great value for the money however ",positive
" this was a gift and was lovely and beautiful. not too big not to small. delivery time was great. strongly advice to buy this ",positive
" i am very pleased with my purchase .the item came to me in 3 days via dhl in a new condition well packed and safe .recomended for reasonable prices . ",positive
" i absolutely love these earrings. very well made beautiful design and a lot of silver ",positive
" this is with out a question one of timex's best watch. i dont know what the the band problem these other watch owners are talking about! band has normal life span and is very easy to change! has plenty of room to get to the pins if you need to change the band. good job timex and amazon!!!!!! thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

" bought 14 fossil watches for christmas gifts all arrived in fine shape from watch zone. of the group this was one of the nicest. perhaps a little heavier than one would expect. recommended ",positive
" this was my first fossil watch i usually buy burberry or d&g but i was so hard for me to tell time on the watches so my friend told me to buy a fossil so i did and i love it is so stylish and cute. i love the way it changes color from different angles ",positive
" this is a really fun and fashionable watch. it has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug. i like the pink dial that changes color. depending on the angle and lighting the dial looks pink yellow or purple. i also like how fossil made the band adjustable. remove or add as many links as necessary. there is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter ",positive
" this watch is automatic has a sapphire crystal and is invicta what more can u ask? and all this for just $200. the piece is heavy u can taste the quality by holding it the movement can be seen in the front and back one of the better looking movs. iv ever seen. i own 7 automatic watches 3 of them are invictas but this have the coolest movement inside it holds the charge up to 3 days and mine only losses 3 minutes in a week. buy this watch is very very reliable.

" light intricate and very cute! they came very quickly and the price was very fair! i have a second piercing in my left ear and i like to wear one there so along with my other jewelry i always have a fairy whispering in my ear : ",positive
" this chain was exactly what i was looking for! it is so cheap but really good quality! i am really happy with this product ",positive
" a nice moderately priced chain that is very pretty. it is fine delicate chain and the serpentine pattern has a spiral look to it. the are reflective areas that shimmer every 1/4 inch or so. i am using with a large cubic zirconia pendant and it is quite stunning. the chain feels strong and less likely to tangle. great purchase for the price ",positive
" i was looking for a cheap but nice chain. this is perfect. arrived in two days. beautiful chain nice strong and polished. great buy for five dollars or a little more ",positive
" very delicate very pretty chain. it doesn't kink up when i wear it and it's the perfect length. i have worn this every day since i received it ",positive
" beautiful detailed and accurate time piece. i have a few watches and this is one i place ahead of all the others i have. large face and can be read at a glance ",positive
" as a field engineer i have to work with tools inside machinery. more often than not i keep my watch and i have had several scratched watches in the past. so i was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try. after 9 months of using it daily this watch has still not a single scratch. the quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture ",positive
" the watch is actually better than it appeared from the photo. one of the few times when i can actually state that something is an even better value than it appeared ",positive
" due to my employment i travel extencively this time piece has in the short time i have owned it forefilled all the requirements i require of a functional time piece at a very competetive price. i would recommend pulsar as a manufacture to any body reqiring quality and style. at this moment in time i have 4 pulsar time pieces that i use on a regular basis 3 are working /daily use sports watches and i have a dress watch for when i am entertaining / partying. none of these watches have ever let me down i have them regularly serviced and new seals every time the batteries are changed regular diving and swimming trips have never caused any problems. my one slight critisium would be the digital read out on this model is a little pale and could do with slightly altering the contrast however it remains an excellent time piece - highly recommende ",positive
" i am studying pilot for now i order this watch and i think it is useful to me as the flight computer with me all the time and i don't just use it when i am in flight but also in the normal life because it look too luxury watch and i like it too much. ",positive
" i've had the watch for a week now and i'm very happy with it. both digital and analog time are exact to the second after a week (checked against apple network time server). the watch looks good and i can't say i've had a problem with the digital display - if it was brighter i think it would tend to be distracting. the slide rule looks good but i doubt more than 1% of buyers will actually use it. one small negative point i have noticed is that although the hands are luminous the hour markers aren't which makes things a little tricky in complete darkness - a silly oversight hence 4 stars. overall though well worth the money ",positive
" you can pay hundreds more for the same product but why? this watch has everything th emore expensive brands do but it costs much less. it is not a cheapy either it still has the pulsar durability and usefulness. great buy ",positive
" first of alli recieved the item in a very timely fashion..approx 3 days..second the packaging was very nice..the chain was a good quality snake chain and the pendent was a very good quality..heavy and prettier in person ",positive
" my grand son calls my wife nana so i had to get it for her for mothers day. great product ",positive
" we don't call our nana grandmother so this necklace is perfect ",positive
" i purchased this watch for three reasons: 2 time zones backlighting constant display of day of week/month & day. did not disappoint. looks cool. i bought this watch on the basis of the other earlier reviews -- very accurate account of the features and performance. i wear it for everyday use ",positive
" this is probably one of the lightest/smallest watches with an interval timer feature which is why i got it. it's also pretty cheap. it has a decent number of other options as well. this particular seller had the cheapest price with the most recent model. very quality ",positive
" i love this watch. it's perfect for swim workouts and aquathlon races -- takes splits can do intervals etc. i use a different product with a heartrate monitor for my runs but can't use it for my swims (since heartrate monitors can't transmit under water and also the unit itself is not waterproof). this timex has an audible chime under water and it's easy to set the various functions. it stores your workout splits so you can recall them later when logging your workout. i also love the 3 alarms - my schedule is different every day so i use the alarms to remind me when to leave work for school when to leave to pick up my son etc. i had lost my first watch (same model) but never found another watch that had all the features i wanted for a reasonable price. this is my second one! ",positive
" this watch has a large display and easy-to-use functions. i get a lot of compliments on the unique band. it's small enough to look feminine yet still sporty. i can't think of anything i would like to change about it ",positive
" this is the 4th or 5th watch in this series that i've owned. this one allows for multiple interval timing. fantastic! i 'did' the chicago marathon this past fall. the group that i train with runs for 3 minutes and then walks for 2 minutes on all of our training runs. this watch alternates these intervals sounding an alarm after each! the buttons are intuitive making it easy to use even with quite a few features. the silver and black color combo has held up much better another black and metallic green timex watch from another line did (the metallic green on the watch face scraped off). the band has openings which is nice (your wrist doesn't get sweaty). good value ",positive
" i've used this model watch for the past three years of my cross-country career and have thoroughly enjoyed it. it's very light and not bulky at all - something every runner looks for in a watch. along with that the interval timer really comes in handy when doing timed work outs or when simply doing crunches. the fit is so comfortable and does not cut or chafe. also the battery life is outstanding (+ 1 year). though i have had a few issues. i broke off the band that keeps the excess watch strap in place - though that may be my own doing from the roughness of the sports i play. also i've had to return the watch for a replacement due to water damage. sure it was covered by the warranty - but it's still a hassle to deal with if the problem comes up - though i've only experienced this when steam gets into the watch or while swimming in high pressure circumstances - like when diving. that being said when i lost the watch - i immediately replaced it with the same model. if you're looking of a light sleek and versatile watch this will definitely do. ",positive
" this pin isn't as pretty in person as it is in the picture online. it is nice but not spectacular ",positive
" i ordered these earrings knowing they would be small. if my ear holes had been a bit more toward the edge of my earlobe they might have fit. these earrings are *really tiny* and do not fit me. i need the next higher up size. these are like 3/8 inch way small for me and also way difficult to even bend/manipulate to open the hoop ",positive
" the earrings were exactly what i wanted. the delivery date was as promised. ",positive
" these are very nice light weight earrings. the look silver and black even though they are not so keep that in mind when you purchase them as to what the will go with. i wear lots of black so it was a pleasant surprise for me. very antique look to them ",positive
" i ordered these earrings thinking they'd be as round as the picture seems to imply. they're really nice but honestly they're not as round as they look in the image which i found a tad disappointing at first. they're not totally flat or anything like that but the drops look a bit flatter in person than they do in the picture. i'm not blaming amazon or silver insanity for it since they've done nothing wrong. products can look different in pictures than in person due to things like light and camera angles. i just want to give notice to people who buy these earrings. and yes they are a substantial piece of jewelry as the previous reviews imply but not so big that they're distracting or gaudy or overly heavy. they're very nice. ",positive
" these earrings are a substantial weight even though they are hollow and the filigree detailing is superb! i fell in love with these when i saw them on the site while shopping for xmas presents for friends and just had to order a pair for myself. ",positive
" these are my favorite earrings: i wear them constantly. they are unique and jazz up even the most utilitarian outfit. they are a bit larger than you might anticipateand it is a size i really like but which might overpower some. the picture at least on my monitor is about life-sized ",positive
" these are gorgeous earrings that just happened to match a pendant i already had. i've had many compliments on them ",positive
" for the price this watch can't be beat. very thin very light and it gets quite a few comments. i am anxious to see how the crystal holds up as apparently skagen is notorious for fragile crystals. at $75 however i won't be that upset if it has to be replaced. overall an excellent buy for the price and no pulling of the arm hair ",positive
" very slick easy to read watch with the contrast of silver hands on a dark blue face. appreciate the smooth comfortable mesh watchband which easily adjusts to your wrist size. ",positive
" this is a nice looking watch overall. if you like this style in black look for the t233xltmn. it is a very very nice watch and popular in europe. ",positive
" the band and face are both so much darker than they look in the picture. also amazon neglected to send the owners manual and warranty information (i had to contact skagen for this). the watch is very attractive though ",positive
" i really like the face and style of the watch. i like the mesh band but the wire may snag clothing or fabric ",positive
" i have skin allergies and was not able to find a watch that i could have on my skin until i found this watch. the price of the watch could not be beat for the chance that i could not have it on. thank you for suppling a great watch. ",positive
" i'm a picky person when it comes to watches. and i'm very rough with them. this watch has far exceeded my expectations on all accounts. its so light i often forget i'm even wearing a watch. i've gotten several comments on it as well. the only negative thing i can say about this watch is that the mesh material of the band is difficult to get water out of. i useally take mine off to wash my hands. overall its a good looking well made tough time piece ",positive
" this was my first watch that was over $100 dollars. i was just getting into watches and wanted something that looked great and would stand the test of time. this watch is beautiful. the polished look won't last forever if worn daily but even when battle-scarred this watch still looks classy. i love that battery replacement is pretty much a non-issue with this watch. its titanium design makes it so light and comfortable that you might forget you are wearing it. the dial window is pretty resilient but i would not test that too much. this is for the most part a dress watch. i also have an invicta abyss automatic diving watch that i wear occasionally but i don't wear it nearly as much as i wear my citizen. my citizen is my favorite watch of all time. its versatility and longevity have impressed me in the three years that i have owned it. i recommend this watch for anyone who wants a beautiful watch that is dressy and still practical for most daily life. i always get compliments about it also. this watch is a good buy. ",positive
" my girlfriend bought me this watch. its design is great and what's better it's super light (titanium hooray!!). i think no country other than japan can produce this kind of watch. citizen you rock ",positive
" i have owned this watch for nearly 3 years now and it has been wonderful. it looks great i have never had to replace the battery (according to citizen i never will either) and it keeps perfect time. the clasp is very easy to operate and it fits very well. it is definitely the lightest watch that i have ever owned. i only have 2 gripes one small one could be a killing point for some people. the small gripe is that the crown (used to change the time/date/day) is a bit difficult to pull out to the correct position to move the date (for months with less than 31 days). you have to pull it only halfway out (pulling it out fully will allow you to set the time) but it has a tendency to go past that to fully out or fully closed. the larger gripe is that this watch scratches very easily. i use the computer everyday for extended periods in my job. because of this the bottom of the band has been scratched considerably on my desk which leaves dark grey marks on my desk and scratches on the band. i have also scratched the metal part of the bezel just by bumping into something. titanium is nice and light but probably not the best metal for a watch especially if you plan on wearing it on a daily basis (even in an office environment) ",positive
" i got the watch off amazon for a birthday gift and i must say i'm impressed. it looked good in the picture here and it looks even better in person! i read about the arm hair pulling problem and i don't have any problems but that's probably because i'm only 15 and i'm asian so my arm hair isn't exactly long so i have no answer to that. my arm is only about 2.5 or so inches wide so i'm skinny needless to say and the watch still fits me fine after removing some links. time is accurate from what i can tell but i had a little trouble setting the date wouldn't turn past thursday at first though i got it to by fowarding the time to the next day. i don't know if it's a problem or not since i haven't read the guide yet. another thing i'm impressed by is the fact that this watch is solid titanium. even in the middle of the links. many cheaper watches are hollow inside the links but not this one it's solid titanium all the way through. as others have said the markers really are very bright in the dark i tested it in a completely dark room and i was able to tell the time with no trouble at all. i would recommend this watch for anyone looking for a stylish watch that's not too pricy. it's great for everyday wear so don't hesitate if you think it's too formal. if i a 15 year old thinks it's not too formal it probably isn't :). hope this helps some of your decisions ",positive
" very nice watch! keeps good time and it's extremely light weight. looks great ",positive
" very light weight appropriately sized not too gaudy or flashy accurate so far reasonably priced - pretty much everything i was after in a watch ",positive
" these earrings are of very nice quality and were what i expected. i am pleased with these ",positive
" well this is the watch band that i originally had on my seiko watch. i searched the internet to find a replacement. amazon had it for a good price. i ordered it and got it in the mail three days later ",positive
" we got these earrings for our daughter on her 6th birthday. she loves jewelry and especially earrings. the color is a little pale the actual earrings aren't quite as pink as they look in the picture. but they are good quality and look great. my daughter wears them all the time. this was a good buy. these earrings are great for anyday wearing or with evening wear. they look very stylish ",positive
" big numbers easy to use all the functions. i use it for flying and timing my instrument approache ",positive
" we finally have a stopwatch that fufills our every need. the display was so large all i had to do was merely glance down. i've gone through several stopwatches but this one is the most durable ",positive
" it look very nice will be an excellente gift for any friend i just have a complaint they just carry this item in zise 7 but still looking very fanc ",positive
" i was more than pleased when i received this pendant! it has a nice feel and you actually know it's there instead of it feeling like a good wind would carry it away. you have to look extremely close to see the peridot in the setting but that is all i have to complain about! definitely worth your money ",positive
" i ordered this watch initially as a gift for someone and when i received it i loved the look and feel of it so much that i quickly ordered another just for myself. it's a very sleek looking watch very lightweight on your wrist and the price on amazon here is at lear 40% below what i have seen it go for regular retail price in the more upscale stores in the malls. i intend to use this watch for special occasions as i believe it will complement dressier attire. ",positive
" i really liked this watch before i bought it and then i liked it some more for another 2-3 weeks. but after that it started to seem plain to me. i want something more fanc ",positive
" this watch looks incredible. the case is solid titanium and the mesh band is tiny stainless steel links infused with titanium. it really can go with anything. you could wear it with khakis jeans a suit pretty much anything because the color is so versatile. if you're looking for a quality watch that looks good and for a really good price well look no further ",positive
" they were quite a bit larger than i expected i don't recall if they listed a size on the page. but i am 100% pleased with the many other purchases i've made with silver insanity. ",positive
" i'm wearing it at the moment. it's lasted this long i don't know why people complaining about. if people wanted a nightvision face for a peice of 18th century tech. they should just buy a seiko. its great for it's sole funtionality which is to look pretty in dance halls. you buy it to get stares guys; or dare i let you do this but; let your girlfriends buy it for you ",positive
" this watch was a gift for my husband. he loves it! he wanted a slim watch he could wear around and this is it ",positive
" this watch looks classy wears comfortably and is very light. my only complaint so far is that it seems to scratch rather easily ",positive
" this is a great watch. the clasp is easy to adjust and takes only 10 minutes to adjust. it was shipped well before the estimated time and is in perfect condition. well made and light it's extremely slim. so if you really like heavy watches this may not be your choice. otherwise it is perfect for everyone ",positive
" this is the best watch if you consider following things: 1. looks: the color of dial and the feeling of dial on hands is really beautiful. 2. size and thickness: if you search for slim watches skagen will be your first and final choice. 3. mesh band: this type of band is the speciality of skagen. its un-comparable. 4. price: considering the price for overall quality this watch is really affordable. bottom line: everyone will notice and appreciate about it. ",positive
" another quality item and very pleased. looks superb with the matching bracelet..will buy more and more from this company as the prices are so reasonable and the quality is awesome! :o ",positive
" the watch is very nice and it came in an excellent condition! it is very beautiful and it has many operations ",positive
" i bought this watch a month bak an i am really happy wit it..ita sightly complicated to learn but overall its absolutely amazing..its a steal at that price..only pwoblem is that the temperature indicator takes time to adjust. ",positive
" i was searching for a watch for weeks saw a picture of this watch and paused. intrigued i began to read the specs: alarm chronograph thermometer light stopwatch world-time zones and more what's the catch? $55usd c'mon seriously with all those features is that all? i was still skeptical but when i got the watch & put it on my wrist i was sold. solid well crafted unique sporty/elegant combination. my only gripe is that slight increase in body temperature can give an innacurate room temperature. we can't have the world but casio has come close with this price i can honestly say go for it ",positive
" this watch has it all at a nice price the display is kind of dark and the band sacrifices some of your hand-hair if u have and i doubt that u don't have else is a masterpiece all stainless steel even base thermomener and a smart cronograph plus 3 yrs battery this is my favourite no other watch has this price/quality proportion. try it and u will be satisfied sporty but looks elegant too ",positive
" the craftsmanship on this watch it absolutely top rate. very nice band not flimsy or cheap. the world time is very cool ",positive
" i love the look but was a little unhappy with the quality of the small melee diamonds used around the dial of the watch. they are very milky and personally i think the watch would look better without them at all if that's the only quality they had. great looking and i'm glad i finally bought it for myself. ",positive
" just got my watch today. it is the perfect watch. i have been shopping around and i was thrilled to find it on amazon for more than $100 less than retail stores! ilove it. ",positive
" i had been looking at this particular watch for over a year and simply did not want to spend the money on it. i found it at amazon.com for half the price i had seen in department stores so i decided to buy it. it is a fabulous watch. i look forward to wearing it each day. it looks great with really dressy suits or jeans and a top. it is a great piece. ",positive
" i purchased this bulova watch as a christmans gift for myself this past christmas '06. i have a small watch collection & i hadn't really bought such an elegant watch before so i decided why not? specially when i researched the price on how much i would save by buying it on amazon. by looking at the pics on amazon it looked so nice but when i received it was the most beautiful watch i had seen or owned. the diamond bezel is just right it isn't to much glitz nor is it too little the diamonds are just right & amazing they sparkle so beautifully against the chronograph face & the stainless steel band. the watch itself is a little heavy compared to other watches i own so it is definitely sturdy & above all just a well made timepiece that i am sure will be not just in my collection but on my wrist for years to come. ",positive
" i rec'd this today. i had been looking for a while for a white faced stainless watch and kept coming back to this one from bulova. (i looked for nearly two years!) i did some looking around online and in stores and amazon by far had the best price (they beat everyone by at least $100) so i did what any girl would do i bought it. it is a substantial watch. it's not a watch for someone looking for something dainty or unassuming. i don't think it's heavy it just feels like you've got a watch on. i personally like the size and weight. i plan on this being my spring/summer watch until it dies or something happens to it. i have a seiko coutura with a black mop face w/diamonds that i love but i wanted something different but sort of the same and this one was it. ",positive
" these earrings are very pretty; i'm very pleased! nice faceting and sparkle. the stones are a medium/bright green with a little yellow and brown mixed in which only seem to make the stones more intriguing and beautiful. the peridot stones in these earrings are the prettiest i've owned so far. highly recommend ",positive
" i am very please with this purchase. the earrings are a very good quality! ",positive
" they sparkle well and look as good as anything else i have seen at the mall stores. i like the non-cup style studs as i think they allow more light to flow through the stone. save your cash and get these. she will be very happy and you can spend the extra money on fishing lures or something. ;-) do not go to jared's jewelers if they are near you...they are evil people. ",positive
" i am very pleased with these earrings. they are a great quality at this price. i would also recommend the matching pendant. great set! ",positive
" the earrings were such a hit that another daughter wants to buy a pair ",positive
" let me just say my girlfriend loved them and then loved m ",positive
" as soon as i saw this watch i had to get it. i loved it because it had really nice details and the butterflies are beautiful. it's a really nice looking and good quality watch. the only problem i do have with it is that the face is quite big. if you have a small wrist it is very large. i still love it and would never return it but feel like it could be a lot smaller. ",positive
" i just got this watch as a christmas present. it is gorgeous. the only thing is it's a little bigger than i would like it to be. the face is so femanine but the size makes it a little masculine. the face is about an inch and a half in diameter and the band is a little over a half inch wide. because it is so pretty i am keeping it however if you prefer a small dainty watch maybe this one isn't for you. my friends are telling me bigger watches are in now so maybe they're right?? ",positive
" beautiful. wear them all the time. sincerely gai ",positive
" i was very pleased with this purchase.these earrings are very simple yet elegant.they could be worn with jeans or to a more dressed up occasion.a good choice for the price ",positive
" the pendant is striking shiny and great to look at. the diameter of the pendant is the size that i expected and the necklace itself is adjustable so you can choose how high or low you want to wear it. great purchase would buy it again ",positive
" this is my second skagen watch. my first one which was almost identical to my new one lasted ten years of daily use. i love the two-tone combination of gold and stainless steel. my only disappointment is that at a glance it is difficult to tell the minute hand from the second hand. i think the hour and minute hands should be slightly more heavier than the second hand. otherwise i love the profile design of this watch including where the comfortable mesh band meets the watch face ",positive
" bought this watch for my wife she likes it. + + stylish & expensive-looking + stainless steel case and bracelet + has a date - - not too good for a small hand. though it is possible to adjust the bracelet to different sizes on a small hand there will be a long part of the band left (under the top layer). it is difficult to make this part invisible as it tends to come from one of the sides. - the clasp is tight. hope it will be easier to open and close after some usage. - the combination of the brushed metal dial and the golden hands makes it difficult to read especially in dim light. - the golden piece is actually just a thin film layer on the inner side of the glass. ",positive
" a very nice watch for the price. very low profile and nice flexible band. would like smaller face but otherwise a great watch ",positive
" i'm delighted with my skagen watch as i was with the previous one i lost. i find the clean modern design makes me feel elegantly turned out. the analog dial is easy to read. the mesh band is easy to adjust to my wrist size. the silver color coordinates with my silver jewelry ",positive
" i love this bracelet. it's very pretty & looks just like it was shown. looks expensive & tasteful. i have bigger wrists so i'd like it better if it came in larger sizes..but it goes great with my watch ",positive
" this bracelet is very simple and elegant. the pav cz has a great sparkle but isn't overboard. i also like the fact that it's a rolo bracelet--the links are delicate and small but very sturdy and have a nice gleam to them. furthermore the charm o is a nice style and doesn't look gaudy. there are some tiny little dots on the back of the charm (not so sure what those are all about). this bracelet looks great stacked on top of my silver bracelet watch. wearing any bracelet can make it hard to type but this one is cool because you can actually peg it nice and tight to your wrist by wrapping the stick part of the clasp beneath the rolo chain if you want it out of the way. i get compliments every time i wear this bracelet; so it's nice that it supports a good cause since it does get noticed. obviously if you're looking for fine jewelry this might not be your choice but as they say diamonds are forever but cz is for right now. ;-) i would recommend this for those in their teens but even for women in their twenties and thirties who like the whole sterling-silver bling-thing. also definitely recommended for those interested in supporting good causes such as ovarian cancer awareness.

" i ordered three pair of these earrings for christmas gifts for the preteen set and am absolutely delighted. very nice quality and beautifully presented boxed in a small velvet pouch. absolute perfection ",positive
" we sent this necklace to our daughter. it arrived actually earlier than anticipated and she just loves it. what a great company to deal wit ",positive

" i selected this stopwatch from the many others simply because it has the indiglo feature and i need to operate in subdued lighting. other advertised features are similar to many other stopwatches. in use i have found it to be quite satisfactory. the readout is clear and large enough to be read at a glance. i have not had the need to explore all of the features but it does all that i would like it to do quite well. there is a short learning curve but not insurmountable. if night vision is an issue this is the only one.... if night vision may be a requirement in the future it is still the only one. otherwise it performs at least equally as well as any others available. ",positive
" the order arrived on time; packaged very nicely. they are quality earrings which was one of my concerns buying on-line and not able to handle them. the price was fair. i would recommend and would myself purchase again ",positive
" i received the necklace and realized that the color was a little more orange than red. i bought it for a friend and i think she will like it regardless. the pendant is very large ",positive
" i bought this as a memento of a brilliant but modest necklace i had seen at the smithsonian institute. i love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi-strands of this design - this combination truly illuminates my evening wear. by far the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court. with so much class it is still affordable. this necklace is an exceptional gem. ",positive
" the th watch was a dream watch to the person it was gifted to. it was bought for a friend and he just loved it. ",positive
" an awesome watch. i absolutely love it. incredible value at this price ",positive
" i am pleased with the watch. it syncs with the big clock in colorado every morning at midnight. we also have a wall clock at home which does the same thing and the difference between the 2 is no more the 1 second at worst. for $40 you can't go wrong. only complaint is my wrist is in between removing 1 or 2 links from the watch band so i chose 1. it rides a tad lose on my wrist but 2 links would make it too tight. guess i need to lose a couple more pounds so i can take another link out! ",positive
" i came across this watch on a friday sale at well over half off a great price. the features were more than adequate for telling time; dead on accuracy plus date and day. i figured setting the watch couldn't be too difficult there are only two buttons so i purchased it with a gift card totally painless. the watch arrived a few days later and i had it programmed easily within 5 or 10 minutes. the watch band is pretty long so i had to remove a link from each side to fit no special tools are needed. while traveling setting the time zones is easy as city codes around the world are listed on the back. the wave ceptor function works fine in boston and in europe. i usually wear more expensive watches than this but this one looks great much better than in the picture. the specs say it has a metal case but it doesn't. it has resin buttons case and back but with some metal cladding. the band is all metal ",positive
" this is probably one of casio's least expensive wave ceptors. it synchs every day indoors in a watch case that's not by a window. the digital display shows the day date and other info such as which time zone what time it synched. i'm just concerned that the analog digital display and receiving every day will make it a battery eater. it's available in different dials but the blue seems to be the most common. i give it 4 stars because the luminous paint is not very bright. and the crystal is acrylic-scratches easily. but that's not really an issue because i have about 15 watches and this one gets very little wrist time ",positive

" good watch for a firts one!!!!!! simple to handled and very easy to use...thanks a lot!! ",positive
" overall this watch is good: large numbers fairly standard set of basic features (date alarm stop watch) crown seems fairly resistant to scratching indiglo lighting is great contrary to the description however the chronograph does not have a lap capability; it only has a split function (2 way). as a reminder it does not have a countdown timer which seems to be a common theme for many timex watches ",positive
" i ordered one of these for the time i spend in the gym and on the track running also it is a good choice if you go swimming every once in a while. of course for that price you are not getting a professional sports watch like the omega's seasmaster but for occasional use it's just great. it has all you need - stop watch alarm the nice light that timex calls indiglo etc. it also comes with a black plastic strap that feels good and unlike leather is really water-friendly. anyway who needs a 50m water-resistant watch if the strap can survive nothing more than a splash of water. as far as accuracy - so far it's ok. i had it for 4 months now and i had to adjust it only once -- it was 2 seconds behind. it doesn't have the fancy functions that you would find in the casio's g-shock series like address book that stores 50 names and numbers or a sophisticated stop-wtach that can split times or measure per lap time nor it has an altimeter but then again you can get it for less then $20. overall i give this nice timex 5 stars - it's a great value watch for occasional use ",positive
" great errings. i got these for my 12 y.o. neice but decided they were too long for her but loved them for myself very cute ",positive
" swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892 and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires. these excellent earrings are made of sterling silver and swarovski crystals and are quite attractive. if you are looking for some nice crystal and silver earrings then these are the ones to get. by the way they look great when combined with the heart star and starburst crystal tattoos - which i also highly recommend! ",positive
" and my wife liked it. it's shiny. what more can be said. :-) i wish the smaller heart was a little larger. you can barely tell what it is ",positive
" let's face it it's hard to find a watch that has it all: a nice band a decent color scheme an elegant but not overbearing look. this has it. i'm sure some will say that the animation is too much but it's very subtle and it can be stopped at the tough of a button. the crystal is not too large and not too small and the band is tough ",positive
" bought this to use at work since i had to send in the one i usually wear for repairs. lumi is extremely bright when charged. the monster has gained 1 minute in 2 days which is not bad for an inexpensive seiko. swapped the band with a nato fits a little bit better on my wrist. overall a good purchase ",positive
" see all over for double the price. works great get lots of compliments more the my more expensive watches. ",positive
" bought this as a gift for my brother. he was impressed by the quality and feel of the watch. he wears it so i think i did pretty good considering he's a tough person to buy something for ",positive
" this is a rugged no frills watch that uses old school technology to do the job so they won't be around for long. ",positive
" these earrings are the beautiful deep blue of genuine sapphires and the 1.0 carat size is just the right size (anything larger might tend to look fake. i've purchased from this merchant many many times and always find myself typing in *sabrina silver* whenever i need or want a new and inexpensive piece of jewelry...they're the best and i've never been disappointed.

" este es un lindo producto hermoso y elegante pero se raya muy facil. igual me gusta y lo uso todos los dias pero no creo que sea algo de muy larga duracion ",positive
" you know how usual it is to see people wearing the tiffany love charmbracelet? this looks exactly like one of those with a twist. it look more like tiffany bracelet with follie follie charms and its a watch. at a price like that it's a steal! however the bracelet is a little too long for my wrist. what's more interesting is that the box of the watch works as a clock itself. how practical can that be. if you are looking for a chrambracelet this it is ",positive

" when i recevied my watchi was so excited! it looked so cool in the picture and ever so when i got it. the harry face on it was neat and the case that comes wit it was so detailed! can't wait 2 sport it when the movie and the last final book arrives!!! ",positive
