" i got this light before the led lights started coming out in the retail channel. those lights tend to almost be too bright but they have the advantage of running for ages on tiny batteries. unfortunately this light uses 4 aa batteries which makes it fairly hefty. it alternatively can operate on an ac adapter. this makes it lighter but it's still bulky because of the battery compartment. the good: the light is nicely bright with a natural quality that's easy on the eyes. it has a ratcheting arm so you can put it where you want and it stays there (better than most of the flexible arm ones) includes an ac adapter slot (though no ac adapter) can help weigh down lighter books to keep the pages from turning nice large clamp for attaching to books. lamp shade which allows you to throw the light where you want without blinding your vision. decent quality plastic - made in china the bad: no brightness adjustment. heavy (can be a benefit in some cases) and makes holding up a book all the more tiring. bulky - makes it really hard for a book to sit properly in your hand. the ratcheting mades a loud click which can wake your wife in bed. :-) the clip has very limited strength and seems to slip easily. eats up batteries fairly quickly - i use rechargeables in it now. i'm giving it an even 2 because it's a pain to use really. hopefully i can find a light weight led clip-on which has a brightness adjustment with a quiet arm that stays in place and most importantly - natural lighting. if so i'll review it on here - but most leds wash out the page making it hard to read. the nice quality lamp is the only reason this one doesn't get 1.5 stars ",negative

" i first ordered this guitar in another color and after about a week of checking the mail with my little boy every day i was informed that it was out of stock. i re-ordered in the bodacious blue and it came friday. it literally came in the cardboard box that you would buy it off of the shelf in with no packing besides a plastic bag around the guitar like your newspaper would come in. there was no packaging slip. i took it out of the plastic and the body of the guitar was damaged around the edge. there was a little divit the size of a raisin where it looked like it had hit something pretty hard. there was literally slack in the strings so they had to be tightened. it would not stay in tune and i would tighten the strings and you could see them loosen again immediately. my little boy began to play with the out of tune guitar that sounded terrible and the next day one of the strings broke!!! this toy is a piece of junk. the sales pitch says a fully functional guitar... great value for the money.... hahaha! i thought this would be a great starter guitar with little investment. i would only recommend this if you are needing a prop or decoration of some kind. it certainly isn't playable! i have no slip to send it back and what i would have to pay in shipping would probably be near what i paid for the thing. don't waste your money!

" i'm really dissapointed with this guitar. i just bought it and after 3 days of being tuned the bridge cracked completely. sound was nice but for using the guitar only during 3 days it's non acceptable. i made sure that string were not overstressed and tuned with electronic tuner having just the top 3 sets of strings (dae) tuned an octave apart (the g was tuned in the same octave) to avoid stress on the guitar. but even with that the bridge cracked. the wood on the bridge is not rosewood but a low quality wood that was the cause of the damage ",negative
" this trumpet is of extremely low quality despite what any other review may say. most of those reviews are written by non-musicians likely parents who were looking for a good deal. granted the instrument is playable it will seriously constrict the development of a player. this instrument is most likely from china which in recent years has sent out thousands of low quality instruments at cheap prices. check out ebay theres always hundreds of these trumpets under various names such as laval bessler and weimer. just remember you get what you pay for. although even used name-brand student trumpets may cost more they are of much better quality and can last a lifetime. stick to name brands like bach yamaha conn selmer king kanstul etc. if you have any doubts give it a quick search at google ",negative

" the only song i know with a 12-string electric in it is rush's xanadu so i let 'er rip. sounded good. i had alot of fun playing around with it. however after an hour or so of goofing around i noticed two things that really ticked me off. firstly the outer tines had already broken. the tines look like a wound steel guitar string but the core is very brittle. they didn't completely fall off they just hung there like limp whatevers. secondly the plastic p'up cover and pick guard looked like they had been scrubbed with a wire brush. i can easily fix those but i wonder what such an abrasive pick will do to the strings if i play it alot. it looks like you can only strum on the down stroke. videos of the jellyfish website confirm this. the problem is you're going against the grain on the upstroke and it catches on the strings. how much fun is it to only play down strokes? it's kind of hard grasp too. it needs a thumb dimple. i'm going to make one using more flexible wound guitar stings to see if its any better. if you've got $10 to blow go ahead and get one ",negative
" lousiest 10 dollars i spent. the tips are already bent and thats at maybe 10 minutes or so of fooling around with it. ive tried it with multiple guitars and the effects and theres no such thing as this thing getting a bow effect. i dunno. scratchy. i dont recommend this at all. ive been playing the guitar for about 13 years now.

" the jellifish is no replacement for a twelve string guitar. you can not play it fast it is fragile and the tone is scratchy. that being said it can be used to make some interesting sounds for color in rhythm and slow lead playing. it is not something i would use often. my 1.00 mm clayton feels and sounds great after after a few minutes of playing the jellifish. after one hour of use the jellifish is starting to show signs of wear and tear. so don't say you weren't warned.

" this is an adorable guitar and it's the perfect size for my two year old but it's made cheaply. the strings loosen after he strums it for a couple of minutes which means i'm retightening the strings each time he plays with it. i guess you get what you pay for (afterall it was only $14.99)!

" i'm a guitar player that decided to pick up the drums as a second instrument and also to help in developing a better sense of rhythm. in the course of my studies i happened across the dd-20c and it seemed to offer some really nice features for what seemed like a reasonable price. the unit itself has 10 preassigned drum kits plus the ability to assign your own custom setup. in addition it offers 16 special effects 4 drum roll effects adjustable tempo and 100 different styles to play along with which cover a wide range of genres. not only that but it offers the package in a very intuitive interface that will get even the rank beginner up and going quickly. sounds like a pretty nice deal right? it would be... if it worked like it's supposed to. actually i'm on my second set right now and this one is about to go back for a refund. the first set i had the pads were so insensitive as to make the unit nearly unplayable. what i mean by this is that there was maybe a square inch or so of a sweet spot where the pads would sound at all and even then i really had to strike hard. the second set i'm on now is far better in response than the first but still falls short of acceptable. for starters the pads don't feel like a real drum skin at all. if one were to compare against an acoustic snare drum for example the snare has a certain bounce to it that this unit doesn't have. basically the pads absorb most of the impact and this in turn makes doing any kind of fast work or rudiments all but impossible. also even though my second set is more responsive from the first i have found that it still takes a considerable amount of force in comparison to a real drum to get the pads to sound off. keep in mind that the pads themselves are only 4 inches or so in diameter... an actual snare starts at 12. in all fairness though i really can't hold the pad size alone against the dd-20 as yamaha did have to keep the overall size and cost manageable and in reality if there weren't the feel and responsiveness issue the pad size should be sufficient. however when these combined factors are taken into consideration i have found that it makes for a frustrating experience. my opinion for what it's worth is that new drummers who are looking to the dd-20 to learn on should do it the old-school way and start with a quality practice pad instead. they are considerably less expensive (a reelfeel 12 pad and sticks will run about half of what this unit costs) indestructible easier to work with and offer at least a reasonable approximation of the feel of a real drum. not only that but a pad also inherently allows for quiet practice. maybe yamaha will fix the feel and sensitivity problems with the next revision of this drum set... then it might be worth it. until then i feel that the dd-20c is best avoided. ",negative
" package arrived in good condition however.....i spent alot of money on this item .......is very small for what you get and then the ac adaptor doesn't even come with it!! these toys are getting more expensive and then don't include any accessories for what you pay for. i like yamaha products but would be very careful in future to buy items like these from online.

" we received the product on-time however the oil container had leaked inside the trumpet box and it smelled real bad. we had to leave the box in the sunshine for almost a week and still it smells bad. as for the trumpet itself after a few lessons at school one of the keys keeps getting stuck and has to be manually pulled out to the normal position ",negative
" contrary to the product description this stool is not heavy duty! the actual seat itself is made of very flimsy plywood and any sort of bad posture or leaning forward will crack it and punch the metal supports through it! the legs are also hard to adjust to optimum length as the retention screw doesn't hold anything in place for long. if you can find something somewhere else i say go for it ",negative
" the videos are amazing! i would have to say better than amazing. the riffs and solos that are taught are fun and work well with the level they correspond to and i feel progresses well with a beginner and beyond at a consistant speed. the only problem is... that there is a grey area that overlaps the term beginner and intermediate so you may have to skip around the lessons to get on track with the course. for instance i decided to learn the riffs and practice the pull offs from the beginner dvds and go straight into the intermediate levels of the course as the beginner sections where way to easy. but i would have to say if powerful riffs and electrifying solos is your passion then i know of no other course that will get you there quicker while having more fun doing it ",positive

" well i don't have much to say. anyone who does a lot of vocal performance sees these suckers everywhere. not only are they terribly common they are common because they are good sturdy mics. good sound quality! happy with mine. shure has been making good mics forever. it's definitely a safe buy for any performer especially vocalists ",positive
" this microphone is an excellent choice for garage bands home-recorders and musical enthusiasts--ultra reliable extremely tough with sound reproduction of a quality which usually requires a much heftier price tag. this is a microphone that will keep you singing a good while. ",positive
" the shure sm58 is one of the most recognisable microphones in the world - and for good reason. it is the main stay of many a hire companies microphone hire stock including mine (pa2hire.co.uk). practically unbreakable and if you do manage to drop it from a high stage / skyscraper you can also buy a replacement pop shield. very suited to rock or other musical styles that need powerful vocals. make sure your singers lips are touching the pop shield to get the best results though unless they have very good mic technique. the proximity effect (increase in bass when you sing or talk close to the mic) makes this important. if the singer is a foot away from an sm58 the chances are they will sound thin and you will also have gain before feedback issues.... sonically the response has a nice presence peak in the upper mid range but the top end rolls off quickly after that. opinion is split about whether that is a good or a bad thing - it helps keep a lid on feedback but it doesnt sound as hi-fi as some other mics. i have had some singers complain that their vocal top end is not quite right - sometimes asking for more top end. i guess they are used to the sound of expensive condenser mics on their recordings. my solution is normally to give them another mic like a beta 58 or beta 87a maybe rather than use eq. if you a/b test an sm58 verses these mics it will always lose. but it can still be a better mic in some cases such as when you are looking for a cardioid rather than hyper-cardioid response (the sm58 has a cardioid response which means it has a wider pickup pattern at the front). but most vocalists will be more than happy with the sound the sm58 gives. the sm58 also does a pretty good job on drums (not really bass drum) and other loud things like guitar cabs. it uses the same capsule as the sm57 one of the best mics for guitar cabs. in conclusion yes there are a lot of mics that sound better and some of these are quite a bit cheaper - but ask yourself the question are they as durable as an sm58 and if you are a professional will your clients want to use a mic they have never heard of? take care justin miller pa2hire.co.u ",positive
" i have been using the shure sm58 microphone for over two decades of live performance. it is simply the best affordable microphone available for lead or backing vocals. it's so durable you could literally use it as a hammer then perform a sweet ballad with no ill effect. i have never had one break down in hundreds of shows. my current primary sm58 has a couple dents from rough use in rough venues but sounds just like it did brand new. the only reason i've ever replaced one is because they were stolen. if you're just starting your professional career this is the microphone you need. if you're a seasoned veteran of the music biz you've probably already got one in your gig bag. get a shure sm58 don't use some crappy thing that costs half as much you won't get enough level into the board. your sound guy will thank you they know just exactly what to expect. any other comparable quality microphone will cost you at least twice as much ",positive
" this is an excellent general purpose microphone at a reasonable price. i'm a classically trained vocalist and i use the sm58 for rehearsal and scratch recordings. it delivers clear true and warm sound under all standard conditions and requires essentially no fine tuning or signal processing. i still prefer the crisp detail of a condenser microphone for formal demo recordings (my favorite is the studio projects c1) but it's hard to beat the simplicity and reliability of the sm58 for everyday use ",positive

" when i got my sr60 i immediately put it on. the headphones are comfortable and easily adjusted to my head. i noticed that the foam had fairly large cells in it. my only previous experience with this type of foam has not been good deeriorating very quickly but i am hoping that these will last longer. the sound is quite clean and balanced. as with most phones in this price range there is a lack of base. had i been able to compare these side by side to the sr80 i may have paid the difference in price to get a bit more base. overall i rate these as very good and are fairly priced ",positive
" i am a professional musician. i loved my grado sr60 so much that when i had a chance to buy a used grado sr80 i did so. i can't tell a huge difference between the two. the sr60 is a tad more comfortable. i keep one set by my bed to listen to beethoven quartets late at night. the separation between the instruments is lovely. the quality is wonderful - very smooth and lifelike. i can't imagine a better set of headphones. there is a clear difference between these and my earbuds - although i can lie on my side with my head on the pillow with the earbuds and with the grado i have to stay on my back. but they are so comfortable i don't mind it. the other set of grado i keep by my rowing machine. i appreciate the long heavy indestructible cord. on that set i listen to loud rock and roll or traditional irish music. it never gets harsh as i turn up the volume and it sounds great. i know there are more expensive cans out there but i doubt the improvement would justify the higher price. if you are wondering whether to spring for the higher priced sr80 set my advice would be to save the $30 and stick with the sr60. i don't feel that the sr80 is much of an improvement. either earphone is wonderful ",positive
" last night as i was going to sleep i listened to a variety of songs - foo fighters elton john queen johnny cash and more. it was an experience. i heard more from folsom prison than ever before. captain fantastic was amazing. not being an audiophile it is hard to explain but the music seemed new.

" great sound low listening fatigue. this does not over-accentuate low frequncies so if you're looking for overly booming bass this is not it. note that it's an open design so that you will hear environmental noise pretty clearly - it will not keep outside noises out ",positive
" i finally caved in and sprung for a pair of these headphones over the weekend. after a few days i can say that i am truly impressed. i have bought and returned many a pair of headphones after being dissatisfied. i will not be doing so with these. accordingly i'll try to write some comments that could help other people with their purchase. there are a few things to keep in mind when selecting headphones. it's also important to keep in mind that with any headphones sound quality depends on the quality of the medium to which you are listening as well as the ability of the device to drive the headphones. my immediate impression of the sr60'swas that bass was a bit weak (matching a few other comments on here) and that high-end treble was a bit subdued as well - but after a few days of trying different kinds of music and listening on different players i have decided that neither is weak at all; sounds are simply much more accurately reproduced than with most of the headphones i'd previously experienced. very significant: these headphones maintain almost identical tonal balance regardless of listening volume. i've never encountered that before and was used to headphones that sound more bright or warm as volume increases. i believe that most budget headphones if they aren't completely lacking in bass tend to exaggerate certain frequencies beyond what you'd hear in a live performance. here's my logic: i tried listening to a few different tracks with the sr60s all high-bitrate mp3s: -- pride & prejudice soundtrack (2005) - dario marianelli - liz on top of the world - (orchestral dominated by piano and strings) - any concerns about weak bass were blown out the door within 30 seconds. it honestly sounded like a *real piano* was sitting in my living room. and who knew that a string section could have so much ambiance? i used to appreciate this track for its music; the notes carry a lot of emotion. i now understand what people mean about appreciating a particular *performance* as well. -- alison krauss & union station - the lucky one - (vocal bluegrass) - you can clearly discern *specific* guitar picks the streaking noises made by musicians' fingers as they slide up and down the strings... and alison krauss' crystal clear voice just shines. it sounds like a live performance. -- max graham feat. jessica jacobs - i know you re gone (original mix) - (vocal trance) - i've much ballyhooed this track as one of the all time best examples of vocal trance. it was also a good sound testing song since it's based on a throbbing bass line and bouncy rhythms but breaks down into a section where it's just jessica's voice piano and strings. i must have listened to this song 200 times in the last year and yet i picked up several new nuances on the first listen with these headphones. a few negatives about these headphones now that i've played with them: -- yes they are bulky. you probably won't want to use them at the gym. i was able to tolerate them on the treadmill but for actually lifting weights or otherwise doing things requiring changes in posture i'll probably stick with my koss ksc75's (an awesome bargain themselves at less than $20 though now that i've tried the grados the koss bass seems a bit artificially inflated). -- these *really* leak sound. on a whim i spun the headphones and put them on so that the outside was on my ears with the foam pads facing outward. they actually sounded louder that way (if muffled) than with the drivers properly facing my ears. the open air design has it's advantages - i think it's partly how these headphones create the illusion of sitting among the musicians - but people around you may think you are blasting your music even if it isn't really that loud to you. -- these headphones *will* expose flaws in the source media and possibly your playback device as well. i can't stomach 128kbps mp3s anymore. when your headphones get this accurate such music seems to have had the life flattened out of it. i tried listening to a few beatles songs and there were certain frequencies missing. it sounded like i was listening to a reel-to-reel tape. oh wait the songs were probably mastered on reel-to-reel. my overall impression is extremely favorable. sure sound quality is a somewhat subjective matter but if your goal is life-like sound and you want to come closer to what the studio recording sounded like these headphones are an awesome effort for the price. ",positive
" the best quality sound in mid and treble ranges. bass some what weak. clear detail and non distorted tones emerge into the balanced inner stage of the headphone. no other headphone under a hundred dollars comes close to the sound purity. biggest flaw is the cord wires easily break creating shorts and loss of one or both sides. i am on my 3rd pair due to wire breakage. repairs by profesionals have not been successful. if you can afford it buy the extension cord to lower the risk of wire breakage ",positive
" i bought the grados thinking i was going to experience heavenly sound but that was not the case. i was pretty disappointed when i first heard them because to me it wasnt much different sounding than my sennheiser hd202s and panasonic earphones. (note: i am not an audiophile and am just an average joe in terms of deciphering sound) but after a week or so i am starting to appreciate them. they are much more comfortable than my hd202s (i wear glasses and the hd202s hurt my ears so much) and definitely sound better. but if u ask me if they sound $69 dollars better than my hd202s i would say no! i am still trying to search for that heavenly sound or mind blowing experience from headphones so if anyone has any recommendations please post them in your revie ",positive
" forget all the silly little earbuds. these are the best pod phones out there for daily urban use. they sit well enough on the ear sound fantastic and you don't have to violate your ears with foreign objects and miss all of the subway announcements. so what if other people can sometimes sort of hear what you are listening to - this is only a problem if you blast your music in a cube farm and if that is going on you have far bigger problems with your life ",positive
" i bought the sr-60 after a lenghty review on the internet. my goal was to find the best available headphones for a low budget (around $80). i have been very satisfied with the sr-60. the sound is great confort is incredible. since sound is not contained they may be somewhat annoying for surrounding non-listeners. so if you are looking for first quality sound low budget headphones and don't care to much about the looks these are the ones to go with.

" this is a great product for the money. for a novice it was easy to use. the instructions were pretty thin but it was simple to figure out. a useful tool ",positive
" the reason i'm rating this a 4 is that i don't have experience with other chromatic tuners so i can't say it's top of the line. but.... i find it very easy to use and love it being versatile in giving me 3 choices/modes for tuning my violin. the price is also very buyer friendly. it has a good mic in it my voice is a sharp my laughter is an e middle. ;o) ",positive
" very easy to use. both the microphone (for acoustic instruments) and the line in result in perfectly tuned instrument. i can't imagine spending much more for a tuner ",positive
" my wife bought 3 of the small children's zithers from amazon and none of them were in tune - so i picked up this wonderful and reasonably priced item to put them in tune and good order. it is a very simple setup with easy to follow directions. within about 10 minutes each i had all 3 zithers in tune with 'zeveral' (ahem!) 5 year olds treating me to 'my darling clementine' in 3-way stereo..... ",positive
" this chromatic tuner powered by one aaa battery has a built-in mike for acoustic instruments and a plugin for electrics. the lcd dial shows the specific tone lights red if too high or too low and green when you have it just right. i have used it on several 6-string (acoustic) guitars a 12-string and a 5-string banjo. the results are incredible- reliable and true. for years i tuned by ear. you know... 5th fret etc. what i didn't realize that an e is not just an e - there may be (are!) thousands of tones - all of which are e's - and this explains why though tuned ok by ear one chord would sound fine while others would sound out of tune. this tuner fixes that. in tune is in tune. i have found it to be among the best (and least expensive) musical investments i have ever made - i wonder how i tolerated the way i sounded before i discovered it - let alone what others may have experienced! a great piece of equipment at a great price. i recomment it heartily ",positive
" got this for my son for his electric guitar. it is so easy and accurate - i really like this product. i was hesitant to purchase it because of the low price - but believe all the other reviews - it is a great value and you will not be disappointed ",positive
" for someone who knows nothing about guitars and how to tune them this tuner is a must have! came w/batteries (aaa) and clear instructions. 1)turn on 2)pick string 3)adjust until you get the correct note. once i looked up the correct notes it was simple. it will even tell me if i'm playing the correct cord. i tried to tune by listening to a beginner cd and trying to replicate the sound as they suggest but on computer speakers it just doesn't work. this little tuner rocks! ",positive
" i was slightly concerned about this product from the one poor review (even though there were more positive than negative reviews) the instruction manual is easy to read and helpful. even if you're just starting out and don't wanna tune by ear this is the way to go. within 10 minutes of taking it out of the box i was able to use it correctly. i highly recommend this. enjo ",positive
" i am a beginning guitar student and i have no idea how to tune a guitar. this little easy to carry easy to use device is invaluable. it's auto function is amazing just play the note and it will automatically recognize what you're trying to do. for someone like me who doesn't want to spend valuable practice time reading manuals for their tuner this is the perfect device. the built in mic works perfectly. can't beat the price ",positive
" this drum set is awsome and affordable. it has a nice clean but deep sound and works for any type of music. but since america now is scared of reading it seems people are neglecting to notice that while the picture has cymbols it has clearly printed it does not come with cymbals. 5 star though ",positive
" the set look very nice. the description does say that the cymbals are not included so i will have to buy them separate. i am buying this set for my nephew for christmas. he is in a band! i hope he likes it ",positive
" by just looking at the picture i see that it has 2 symbals witch all of the other ones that i see in the site only have one unless you wanna pay a million dollars. so im thinking of byeing this one or acually haveing my dad bye it for me ",positive
" i have a garage band and i needed i good set of drums so i bought these. iwasn't sure if i want them at first but i made a great decision! now my drums go everywhere with me! this is a great pick ",positive
" judging by the picture it looks very good for the price and also has two crash cymbals which many other starting drums do not featur ",positive
" i ordered this guitar for my 4 yr old grandson for xmas after he became interested in my guitar.the company did a fantastic job and it was shipped and received in time for xmas .the guitar was surprising detailed not like those plastic ones you see in stores with fishing line strings..these were real steel strings with an extra string just in case.the only draw back so far has been in keeping the one of the strings taunt. there is an adjustment screw in the back of each tuning peg but if you constantly tighten it it becomes loose..overall my grandson is completely amused with his tarand spends hours playing us songs...thank ",positive
" i bought this toy guitar for my 3 year old grandson and he fell in love with it. it looks just like a real guitar. in fact he put it in his dad's guitar stand. it can't be tuned like a grown-up's but for a 3 year old and considering the inexpensive price tag it's just fine. if he continues to show an interest in music i will buy him a better one. i will definitely shop at austin bazaar again....they were better than advertised. ",positive
" music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills. in any case making music is fun it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm counting and doing things cooperatively. a collection of percussion instruments like blocks and percussion accessories like triangles sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. this is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. it is also great for christmas; bring the kids along to carol and have the smallest kids keep time with the traingl or make up your own percussion accompaniment. ",positive
" after a long spell out of society i was advised that the best way to get back in touch with my fellow man was through the medium of music. my parole officer advised me that creative activities such as playing an instrument tend to show us how cultured and worthwhile the lives of humans are rather than looking on one's fellow man as a fetid and putrid beast. i have always enjoyed listening to music and whilst not being equipped to learn any complex instrument percussion is definitely where it's at for me! i purchased this pulse triangle as a means of beginning the road to becoming the next phil collins or ringo star. i found the pulse triangle to be easy to use and rewarding in the results. i am able to add my own accompaniment to most tunes from fleetwood mac's 'albatross' to nirvana's 'smells like teenspirit'. i did have some trouble mastering the later as higher tempo tunes tend to be difficult to keep up with. my girlfriend likened me to an epileptic gymnast as she watched me playing along to the william tell overture. in summary if you are looking for a way into music and want a simple instrument that tests the water then the pulse triangle is for you. it's cheap enjoyable and very forgiving. however it is not recommended for playing naked ",positive
" the package includes the xlr cable microphone stand and the nady microphone. the quality is excellent. the stand by itself costs $38.00 at the stores the cable around $20.00 and the mic around $30.00. if you need just one of these three items you get the other two for free. ",positive
" if you're looking to start out in recording podcast sound clips or speech this works great. i bought the package for the stand which is living up to my expectations - great. the xlr cord works good with my condenser mic. i counted the mic as a bonus not expecting much but for an inexpensive dynamic mic it does an adequate job. the package is definitely worth the 20.00 that i spent for it. ",positive
" we purchased this microphone for use at our church. it works perfectly sounds great and was a steal for 20 bucks! ",positive
" the mic is cheap the stand is nice but what a combo deal! i likes i like ",positive
" i don't know how nady can supply a mic cable and stand for $25. the mic isn't anything to write home about - it's no shure sm58 but it is better than could be expected and probably worth the $20 on its own. and then you have an xlr mic lead - try and find one for under $10 anywhere. and it's actually reasonable quality too. and you get a mic stand - you'll spend $15 on an equivalent stand. it is a prefectly adequate mic stand. indestinguishable from the other mic stands i've purchased at $20+. you can't go wrong with this package. the mic's not pro but for a stand cable and mic it's amazing ",positive
" this package deal is unbelievable . you get a well built stand a mic cord mic clip and sp1 microphone for $19.95 the quality and sound are great. if you play out in small bars and taverns like i do this package is for yo ",positive
" the microphone and cord are very good quality. the stand is solid and easy to adjust. note xlr cord connector. an adapter is needed for 1/4 connection ",positive
" this is an excellent buy for a built-in sound system. we bought it for our church and everyone is extremely pleased with it. we couldn't believe we got the whole package for less than $30 including shipping! everything plugged in perfectly no adapters needed. service was amazing too; it was here two days after we ordered. thanks ",positive
" i didn't know this brand before ( i'm not particularly audiophile) but i wanted good isolating headphones at a good price. for the price ($50) the sound quality is excellent they are small and fit in the provided pouch; a really nice touch is the small volume control embedded in the cable. sound is scomparable to sennheiser and bose sets costing twice or three times as much. the only downside is that the metal band make the headphones not very comfortable at the beginning but you get used to it it's not big deal. overall i highly recommend this sounds excellent and matches the white ipod :-) ",positive
" i shopped online for probably two months before finally settling on these headphones. i wanted nice headphones to compliment my ipod yet at an affordable price. the akg k 27i is the perfect solution. after looking at other models by akg and other brands like sennheiser and bose i thought i would have to spend at least $100 in order to get quality but then i found these and i snatched them up. the sound is excellent. when i first plugged them in i thought they were a little quiet. but then i discovered that there is a lanyard-style volume switch on the headphones themselves which is fantastic. i don't have to reach into my pocket to turn the volume up or down on my ipod. the sound is very crisp and articulate with deep accentuating bass. and because these headphones are designed for portable mp3 players my ipod is powerful enough to really push the drivers of the headphones. the soft ear pads offer great comfort for long listening (and sound dampening! they block out a lot of ambient noise!) but the headband takes some getting used to as it is a little bit tight. once you adjust to it though you can wear them for hours. the last thing i will mention is the style. these headphones look great and the colors compliment the white ipod really well. they also fold up to an incredibly compact size and they even come with a travel pouch. now that is convenient. if you are looking for great headphones for your portable mp3 player i truly say look no further. i did so much research before settling on these that i feel like i became an expert in the audio field. the akg k 27i offers amazing sound great comfort compact size and best of all affordability ",positive
" every gigging musician knows that when something as petty as a mic clip gets broken it is more than a little annoying. i have this as my spare and think it works just fine ",positive
" the metronome was everything i expected. i wanted a metronome that was very loud so that it could be heard while playing in an ensemble and also one that had a volume control. the sound is loud enough to be heard while playing ensemble and has good volume control. it is not digital so one can easily switch tempos. it is light enough to be easily carried around. what i would have liked but did not expect is a tempo range that goes beyond 40 - 208. unfortunately that seeems to be found only in digital. ",positive
" i am pleased to get this stuff very soon. however i thought i got blue one (center of the circle) because they show a picture to customer like blue one. so i expected to get blue one but the seller sent me red one. it does not matter the color but someone like me wants to get the same product you show me by online. overall i am satistifed with this product. well my metronome has a scratch already so be careful!! ",positive
" the sound quality is nice rather than harsh like some metronomes. it does have 2 sound levels built in; the adjustments are on the side. one is louder than the other which has a softer sweeter quality. i can practice with my mute on or off and change the volume accordingly. using a metronome: all of my violin students (children and adults) begin at number 60 on the dial. if the time signature says 4/4 each quarter note receives one beat and there are 4 beats per measure. they practice scales exercises and all songs at 60 to begin with. once they master everything at 60 they move the dial to a higher number. the following numbers are 63 66 69 72 76 80 etc. (all the way to 208 on this metronome) their goal is to play at 80 with no mistakes. many students can play well at numbers higher than 80. ",positive
" we've tried several brands of metronomes and now our family has two seiko sq-50s in use. the best feature is that the clicks you hear are crisp and the quality of the sound is not irritating like other metronomes we tried. it's so easy to use even the youngest child can do it. and the size is just right -- small enough to fit beside the music on a music stand or piano but large enough that it's not easily lost ",positive
" this metronome shows the different italian terms used to describe tempos. this makes it easier to know at what tempo to practice your music ",positive
" just bought the metronome from johnson instrument it looks quite different from the picture. the new verson looks sleeker which is nice. it is very compact and can be put in the student's violion case to carry around. it has a volumn control which can be completely muted with only light flashed which is an excellent feature. the light is larger. however the sound tone for this new version has been changed. don't think i like that part too much too electronic.. but overall it is quite good. ",positive
" usually a metronome is used for musical purposes but i actually purchased it for karate training. i do a hundred kicks on each leg per type of kick and i use the beat from the metronome to keep me going at my desired pace. also i can boost the pace and keep track of my improvement. i know a bit odd but it really does the job for what i wanted it for. ",positive
" this is the first metronome we have owned so can't really compare to others. but this one is reliable and very easy for our daughter to use. it is loud which is good for her to hear over her piano playing. the headset option is great for when we the parents simply cannot have the distraction. our daughter has a much more solid practice session as a result of this metronome. the only drawback is that the dial only includes certain tempo markings....a very wide range but not every number. this does not pose a significant problem. though when the piano teacher advises a practice tempo marking that this does not have we are forced to accommodate. but otherwise very good ",positive
" works great just annoyingly loud for use with a keyboard. we covered the speaker with duck tape - fixed it ",positive
" this device is made without varistors which are burned up as they block transients and surges in power lines. our av system and hdtv are connected to it it has worked perfectly for the several months we have used it blocking spikes in the power lines to expensive av equipment ",positive
" i bought a used flames strap from eddie and it feels (and looks) great. i love it and my bro does as well very good buy ",positive
" this microphone does a pretty decent job at capturing a variety of sources its quite surprising for a condenser mic at this price. excellent for vocals acoustic guitars and reference room condenser mic ",positive
" i am very much satisfy with the mxl condenser microphone with socmounti purcased from amazon.i will encourage any individual to shop in amazon online shopping.i felt so comfortable and confident when i first placed my order.they are so amazing in any aspectwhen it come for the right order and shipping trust amazon.i believe in doing business with amazon online shopping. feel free to shop with amazoncom. thank you. from walter che ",positive
" nice mic at a great price. however it doesn't include a pop filter which is essential. i was shocked to find that these filters can cost as much as the mic ",positive
" this is mic is good for the price but i didnt realize that it had to have a phantom power adapter so i had to spend about 40 bucks on that and buy to more mic cords so that ended up costing me over one hundred dollars but this mic is great and looks very pro. you cant beat the price and the only problem i have with it is the you can hear everything around you when using it loud and clear. but outher than that it is the best mic i have had thus far ",positive
" i have had this microphone for almost 3 years now and it still works well. the shock mounting has broken but the actual microphone unit is still going strong. i am definitely not an expert in music but i do like sound. i find the highs are a little extreme and sometimes bordering on harsh in this microphone. i realise that terms like 'muddy' are somewhat open to interpretation but i have no qualms with the clarity of the midtones in recording solo vocals or acoustic instruments. as has been noted in previous reviews this microphone requires phantom power. i'm running it through my alto s-6 mixing desk. at this price it is definitely picking up one of these microphones i'm very happy having chosen it as my first compressor mic but now (after almost 3 years) i think i should upgrade ",positive
" i have two of these because they're so cheap and use them mainly at home if i have a musical idea. one of the reviewers above mentioned it was a bit muddy which i totally agree with. but it's incredibly cheap and fairly detailed for that amount of money. i'm curious how it will hold up over years of use. anyway this is probably the perfect step-up mic for podcasts if you are currently recording with your computer's built-in mic or a radio shack dynamic mic. i would choose this over the m-audio mics- it feels slightly more durable ",positive
" i purchased this mic to record mandolin and acoustic guitar in my pc based home studio and couldn't be happier. it accurately reproduces my taylor acoustic guitar. when used in conjunction with an art tube pre-amp it actually enhances my low cost mandolin. no regrets here ",positive
" i really like this kit. the only drawback is that it doesn't have a smaller allen wrench for lowering the strings on my guitar ( behrenger v-tone) therefore a 4 star rating ",positive
" the dava technology is my favored type in all situations. the combination of a flexible center and a rigid playing surface is wonderful. in addition the pick surface is textured to enable a better grip with wet or dry fingers. dava is the only brand of picks i use and each type suits my every need. i whole heartedly recommend them to anyone. ",positive
" for some reason i tend to shred most regular picks very quickly. this pick with the nickel plating lasts a long time. also gives a nice sound ",positive
" i have been playing guitar for a little over 10 years and i really love these strings. i have tried brands such as ghs ernie ball dr and more but these seem to have one of the best feel. they have a real clarity in tone and are a great match especially for someone starting out playing it will help their fingers not bleed as much because of the feel. the only brand that i think is a bit better is dean markley blue steels. they last longer are brighter and i am liking the feel a bit better as well. none the less for the price and over all value these strings are awesome and even in my house you will find a dozen sets ready to string up ",positive
" wow i love this mic stand!!! it really works well especially since i play guitar and you can adjust the boom. it's great for kids and grown-ups too. i recommend it to any kid that is just starting to sing or if you want to record onto cd's you can play guitar and sing. rock out!!!!!!! ",positive
" im no pro but once you get these bongos and tune them they sound nice. i jam on them all the time and the quality gets better and better as the skins thin out the sound comes out a lot more. definitely worth 20 bucks ",positive
" worth the order came as dscribed on time (birthday present) and in good shape. it was the hit of the party. ",positive
" i bought these bongos as a christmas present for my 15-year-old son. he is very happy with them. they seem to be well made have skin heads and are tunable. we are very satisfied with this purchase ",positive
" these are great fun! my daughter loves to shake them and sing. brightly colored and good quality. they are fun for the whole family and just the right size for small hands. they are good for play other than just musical as they can be sorted according to color (if you get more than one) and put into things and taken out again; they lend themselves to hours of fun ",positive
" i didn't forget anything. i just have the title to sa ",positive
" these are great shakers to add to a rhythm band. i ordered six and received six different bright colors. great for kids to shake. the company shipped the order quickly ",positive
" the pop filter is of decent quality. the stand is not as flexible as i might have hoped so it makes it hard to use it with the desktop blue snowball microphone that i have but that's remedied by attaching it to the desk itself ",positive
" this pop filter does exactly what it purports to; the flexible neck *does* sacrifice a bit of flexibility in favor of stability which can be a slight drawback if (like me) you use it on a tabletop mic stand. still quite recommended ",positive
" this is a nice harmonica in a convenient hard case. it's a good size (like the old marine band) it plays easily and has a good tone. only problem is a couple of notes keep sticking and won't play. i wedged them open but they stuck again. oh well it's still nice ",positive
" i received my order promptly. the harmonica was just as good as that instrument has always been. i would highly recommend the product and the seller ",positive
" my daughter bought this harmonica with a gift certificate that she had received. she just loves it. this is a quality harmonica with great sound. we received fast delivery and it was packaged well. no complaints here ",positive
" i started playing harmonica earlier this year on a couple of supercheap hohner products then picked up this one. it costs more but it's worth it. it has loud clear notes is good for playing single notes and the two-draw is uniquely warm and friendly. superior to the marine band the golden melody and the lee oskar. ",positive
" this is a relatively affordable harmonica; it has a good feel- the holes are well spaced. overall it is easy to play; whenever i am playing out of key or whatnot on another harmonica i turn to this one and it sets me back on track. sounds great too ",positive
" well i started on a kay $1.99 special and they play good too but once i saw how fun harmonica is- i stumbled onto a little better harmonica an old old hohner american ace and it played so easy i had to get the top of the line hohner and got this special 20 in key of c. it did take a little while to break in the special 20 before it played as easy and sweet as it's step brother- the american ace. it has a more contained refined sound than the other two i mentioned and bends well. i still find my american ace bends easier but it's probably 10 years old and the reeds are weaker than my brand new special 20. i am still curious about the lee oskars but for the history of hohner the average $7.00 cheaper than lee oskars and the fact it is made in germany i opted for the special 20. awesome harmonica at an awesome price. they also have a short waranty unlike other brands. ",positive
" i am a new harmonica player trying to substitute shopping and technical research for practice and talent. i went out and bought nearly every diatonic harmonica under 40 bucks. most fell by the wayside. i still use the special 20 every day for a couple of reasons. the one i have is easy to play. and only the plastic cone touches your lips not the brass plate that sticks out on lots of hohners. (that's the only reason the golden melody comes in second for me.) overall it just feels really nice in your hand smoother even than the non-stick pro models. unless you are shopping addicted as i am this is the only harmonica you are going to need for a long time ",positive
" i have been playing harmonica for more than two years now. this was my first harmonica ever; the one i learned on. the notes are clear it lends its self to bending and just sounds good. perfect for learning on. great for continuous play. i recomend this harmonica to anyone who askes me about brands or keys; the hohner special 20 c ",positive
" i'm playing a lee oskar right now. love it....o yea! i play nothing else. hohner is good but give me an lo any day. they are so airtight and sound so sweet. ",positive
" though the sound as such is like music it is really hard to get to play this without lessons. suggest a starter book with the instrumen ",positive
" lee oskar sounds good feels good and it is repairable. they really do last a long time. i bought a different brand and i had one of the reeds break within a month or so ",positive
" my husband wanted to learn how to play the harmonica--it was easy and fu ",positive
" this is a perfect harmonica for beginners. i wouldn't go as far as saying it's for everyone...but if you're a beginner and are interested in learning to play the harmonica then this one gets two thumbs up ",positive
" this was a decent harmonica for a decent harmonica player.. if you haven't played many harmonicas and you're generally a beginner then i recommend this harmonica to you but if you play pretty good you deserve something better than this... it dosen't go too loud and dosen't have the clearest quality but for the price what can you expect? and even if it dosen't have the clearest quality it still has decent quality and it's great for it's price even if it is cheap... so highly recommended for the beginner and that's why i gave it 4 out of 5 stars ",positive
" i am extremely pleased with the quality of this purchase and the featured capability to replace the reed plate if that should ever be needed rather than buying a complete new harmonica. i consider myself a beginner and wanted something that would be durable and long lasting for the money i had to spend. i had considered the hohner piedmont blues 7 piece harmonica set but after reading some of the customer feedback i decided to go for the lee oskar diatonics which are of better quality. ",positive
" i am a grandmother of nine!!! i heard a man playing harmonica in a furniture store while his wife shopped and it was wonderful! instead of being annoyed everyone within earshot was all smiles and a small crowd formed. i wanted to be able to do that also as i love music. i had tried piano and was all thumbs- but this lee oscar major c diatonic harmonica is just the berries. it took me some time to figure out the breathing but there are lots of sources for good instruction. i would practice in the evening while my husband read. i kept saying honey do you know what i'm playing? he would say no. after about a week of this routine my husband started to play name that tune! i have been so thrilled. this is a great harmonica with beautiful tones and the best price around. you won't regret this purchase if you love harmonica. i especially like the fact that the reeds can be replaced if necessary by unscrewing the case. this lee oskar harmonica is great- but the bottom line is practise. at some point i know i will feel comfortable enough to play in the hardware store while my husband shops ",positive
" i have owned about 30 different harps including 5 lee oskars. the lee oskar is the best. sounds good too. it bends easily when you want it to and does not bend when you don't want it to. if you don't know how to bend the notes get a lee oskar and learn how. then you can bend notes on any of the others but it is harder and does not sound as good. if you pay attention to the videos most of the professionals use this brand. if you are a beginner buy this because it make you sound better ",positive
" the lee oskar harp plays well. the easy to keep clean plastic body is constructed for maintainability which will improve the overall lifetime of the harp ",positive
" this tuner does the job. it's got a cheap looking case but it works and that's the important part. the one guy below said it was too difficult to open the battery door...the battery door is a little tough to open but seriously how much do you need to open it. also it takes aaa's which are cheaper than 9v's. anyway not a bad buy but watch out for other things from musician's friend. i also ordered a strap and a gigbag which both specifically stated they were for acoustic bass and they were way too small. the tuner's ok though ",positive
" wonderful little device. works very well priced appropriately comes with two aaa batteries. the seller shipped this out at lightning speed. ordered on a saturday night and the item arrived today (monday). the method to open it to insert the batteries could be made easier ",positive
" i've seen tuners come and go mostly at a high cost. i bought this to tune both of my guitars and my violin and so far it hasn't let me down. i thought i had a good ear for tuning but this little gadget quickly corrected me and now my guitar sounds better than ever... highly recommended ",positive
" i am a beginner learning guitar and this product helps me tune my quitar in a jiffy.awesome product ",positive
" had mine for almost 2 years now and it works great i use it for my violin. my teacher has no problems with it. easy to use and simple. ",positive
" this tuner makes it pretty easy to tune (it has a jack input and a microphone) but it doesn't have much of a range. the tolerance seems to be only about a step or a setp-anna-half so if your strings are off by more than that you'll have to tune by ear a little first ",positive
" i use this tuner for my violin. i use the automatic setting and have found it very easy to use. the needle on the screen shows if you are below or above the note and once i put fine tuners on my violin tuning became a very quick process. like others i found installing the battery was annoying. it's easier if you focus on pushing one side tab at a time. the directions are not helpful for someone unfamiliar with tuners. pressing the pitch button raises the hz. my teacher prefers hz 441 vs 440 so i have been able to use that setting. i highly recommend this tuner for beginning musicians. it has been accurate and easy to use ",positive
" my son really likes the way the picks make his guitar sing ",positive
" as a relative beginner to playing the guitar i can say these are great picks for the price. you really can't beat the price and quality. i have had no problem using them for casual guitar use/practice. however when ordering this item on amazon you are not given the option for choosing the thickeness of the pick. when ordering this same item on other websites you are given the option to choose either heavy medium light picks but here on amazon when i ordered i received medium thickness picks. for the casual guitarist i think this isn't an issue at all. for serious guitarists i think they would want to specify the thickness ",positive
" celluloid guitar picks burn like the dickens. it's totally cool: just hold a lighter to 'em and they go up in a flash! be careful not to hold them with your fingers though because fire is very hot and it will burn you. just remember fire bad! and you won't go too far wrong. if you're looking for picks to play guitar with celluloid is worthless. they're fragile and the surface is far too slick if your hands sweat at all. try tortex or delrins. tortex is the business in my experience. i should note that every one of the guitar picks mentioned in this review is fully compatible with all major operating systems except for cpm/80 and the old incompatible time-sharing system from mit except for the delrins which create a sort of tesla-coil effect when used with one's-complement integer systems. but you don't run into those very often these days so it's not a big issue. besides it looks cool.

" they're cheap durable feel good look great and there's really no noticable difference between them and more expensive teardrop picks except the price and the logo ",positive
" why pay 4-5 times as much for the same exact pick? think about it... fender doesn't have a factory that manufactors picks? neither does musician's friend... so there is a factory out there somewhere that is making picks for both fender and musicians friend... same pick .. different printed name .. duh.. i've been using these mf picks for a few years now.. i see them on sale for 99 cents i buy 30 freakin dozen !!! don't be a freakin chooch... buy a bunch of them !

" you want a cheap fender guitar you buy their lower notch brand squire.you want their lower notch pickswell unfortunately they dont exist.thats where these come into to play.they are cheap and somewhat durable.celluloid picks have a tendencey to snap right across the middle though. they wield great sound and if used right like any other guitar pick great potential.the looks are nice but i like the signature of a real fender pick.after all these are the fender pick shape and size. i say buy these the price is a steal.i say avoid these if you plan to play metal.

" these tambourines are great for the basic use...very sturdy. you really can't argue with the price. i've seen some tambourines and the price tag on them and have to wonder where did the twenty dollars go? if you simply want to enjoy the music this is your best bet ",positive

" tis is one of if the best sounding tambourine i have ever owned! a++++++++++ ",positive
" i own a couple of tambourines but have played a few. this one is light bright and kinda cool looking. the inward placement of the handle allows it to be played windshield wiper style with the wrist or a combination of both allowing for great speed and variety. you can also get two different soundings hits whether you use the inner or the outer ring. hit the inner ring for a more open sound and the outer for a more dry and close one. all in all a nice tambourine specially for the price ",positive
" this is a good product to have if you want a light weight portable keyboard. the only one complaint that i have is the glue holding the bottom and the top together has come lose several times. i had to get a special adhesive that works well on rubber products to glue it together again. the sounds are good and it is fun to play and you can play it anywhere there is a hard surface to place it on.

" i bought the program reason and the tutorial dvd simultaneously so i really did not have the opportunity to play with the software before viewing the dvd. that being said i could not see using the program effectively without the dvd. this was the the first true piece of audio software i ever purchased so to have a visual/audio aid to guide me step by step through the process was a lifesaver. from a beginners standpoint the dvd uses some terms that are unfamiliar and kind of hard to grasp. but with repeated viewings i am able to make some great music. i would recommend this dvd to anyone who has purchased the program reason ",positive
" music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills. in any case making music is fun it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm counting and doing things cooperatively. a collection of percussion instruments like blocks and percussion accessories like sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. this is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. it is also great for christmas; bring the kids along to carol and have the smallest kids keep time with the sleigh bells or make up your own percussion accompaniement.

" this case is light and easy to carry due to multiple straps. is sturdy yet padded to protect the guitar. also has a lot of storage for picks notebooks etc ",positive
" musician's friend ships orders very quickly and i got this bag together with my new dreadnought guitar within 3 days. this bag is really well priced ($15) so it's a great deal. it is built with very sturdy nylon which protects the guitar well. the nylon is not very thick (about a third-inch) but it gets the job done. it also has nice shoulder straps to allow carrying the guitar over your back. the only weakness is that it does not have many/good pocket compartments. it has a large pocket but the pocket cover is not tightly closed - it's closed with a strap so things could fall out if you somehow get the bag upside down. it also has a smaller pocket on top of the larger pocket - this pocket has a zipper and things will not fall out. overall a great bag for the price ",positive
" i ordered this item on the 31st and recieved it on the 2nd!!! very good buy on the gig bag and the quick delivery was a pleasent suprise. thank you ",positive

" everyone has known for a good while that if you wanted *clean* *distortion* get the big muff no question. it is i'm happy to say the same and really better. i bought my second just a bit ago having heard of the sustain feature for the first time. not to gild the lily but i'll be dipped. it makes it better. i think the best and most effective thing i can say is: get a decent used amp no efx if possible. use the simplest amp with only big muff and that will 95% sure find the sound you wan ",positive
" for years i used rat distortion boxes for guitar and for bass. now i play bass a lot more in bands and find the rat sound to be weak and one dimensional. i sold off my rat and tried out a number of other distortion boxes at a local shop and settled on the big muff pi. this thing is rich. the complexity of the distortion is incredible compared to what you get with most other pedals--must be the brilliant russian engineering behind it. it has three knobs: volume sustain and tone. the volume is obvious the sustain is really the distortion level. for the bass i run the sustain very low and the volume higher and get a great mix of clean and distorted tone. sometimes i run the sustain knob turned all the way off and this thing still drives the sound nicely. too much distortion on the bass and you loose your ability to cut through the rest of the band in my opinion. the tone knob adjusts the center frequency of the distortion. i run mine way over to the left and distort the low end around 200-400 khz. you can crank it around and get anything from a low grumbly distortion tall the way to a really tinny irritating heavy metal sound. this thing is versatile and no matter how you like your settings the distortion it produces is rich in harmonic overtones multi-dimensional and unlike any other boxes i've tried. highly recommended. my only complaint is that this box is designed to work only on battery power--no ac adapter at all. fortunately now there's an adapter from one-spot that can be connected to a battery lead and then to an ac adapter. hopefully amazon will start carrying that soon.

" we bought this pickholder for my 6 year old son who just got a guitar for christmas. the pickholder has a little peice of paper on the back of it that you just peel off and then stick the holder on your guitar. it's great to not have to worry about him losing his picks. i think the holder fit about 10 picks in it. the picks fit into the holder perfectly and come out with ease. great product especially for kids ",positive
" does exactly what it's supposed to. i don't play guitar that much these days but this met my needs just fine ",positive
" product was recommended by my teacher works just as he said it would ",positive
" this is my first capo so i can't accurately compare it to another. however i am very pleased with the quality. it goes on quick and comes off quick with no compromise of the sound ",positive
" the kyser capo is well designed. normally parked on the head of my guitar i can easily add move or remove in 2 seconds. the unique feature of this capo is that you can flip it around for example cover the 3rd 4th and 5th strings on the second fret to convert it to an open e b a e b e tuning from a standard e b g d a e tuning. very reliable and fun. highly recommended ",positive
" i checked out these little $15.00 pedals out at guitar center and was surprisingly impressed. they're very quiet and sound great. for someone who wants to explore effect processing these are a great start. same goes if you are just expanding your pedalboard like myself. the only cons are you can't see the setting of the knob from the top (but it does give you the experience of trusting your ears and not your eyes to create the right effects) and the footswitch is difficult to trigger if the box is sitting behind another pedal. and to the review whining about not getting a battery with the pedal...wwwaahhh wwaahh wwaahh!!!! buy an adaptor!! these are a great little pedals for the price! ",positive
" this unit is simply stunning: a beautiful harmonic warm rounded overdrive sound. way better than any of the boss boxes check out the sound on the dan electro website. i bought this based on sound not price but that makes it all the sweeter ",positive
" i have 3 danelectro fab effects pedals. the sound i get from this overdrive pedal is much more than i thought i'd get for my starter collection. a couple more expensive effects i purchased made by another brand don't seem to be any better than the danelectro fab. the casing is a heavy duty plastic not metal so i'm not sure how well it would hold up to stage use or someone with a heavy foot. as for the comment about this pedal being a waste of time by another reviewer most guitarists already know that they need to purchase an ac adaptor for a power source. consider it a learning experience. once you buy the adapter be sure to pick up a multi-plug cable if you want more than one effects pedal. this allows you to hook up several more plugs to the one ac adaptor. i now have 5 effects pedals hooked up to one energy source. bought mine at the guitar center so i don't know if amazon carries them. radio waves are everywhere and travel great distances depending on the tower they come from. i used to get a woman talking to truckers over her cb radio through my stereo. talk to a friend who is an electrical engineer or someone at an electronics store about suggestions to cut down on or eliminate radio interference ",positive
" very impressive tone for such a cheap pedal. i love danelectro pedals i have 4 of them. they're cheap but very reliable and sound as good as pedals that are 4 times the price. doesn't quite achieve the tube stack sound but overall it's a good overdrive. ",positive
" i loved my grado sr60 and when i had a chance to buy a used grado sr80 i did so. i can't tell a huge difference between the two. i keep one by my bed to listen to beethoven quartets late at night. the separation between the instruments is lovely. the quality is wonderful - very smooth and lifelike. i can't imagine a better set of headphones. there is a clear difference between these and my cheap earbuds - although i can lie on my side with my head on the pillow with the earbuds and with these i have to stay on my back. the other set of grado i keep by my rowing machine. on that set i listen to loud rock and roll or traditional irish music. it never gets harsh as i turn up the volume and it sounds great. there are more expensive cans out there but i doubt the improvement would justify the higher price ",positive
" i bought a pair of these my wife tried them and liked them so much that she asked me to get a pair for her for valentines day (chocolates and flowers don't do it for her). these headphones sound as good as my bose for a fraction of the cost but give up a little in comfort (they do fit better with more use). do they really need that thick of a cord? ",positive
" i compared several headphones and found these to be the best by far at such a good price. i recommend them to people who like quality listening. i use them with my ipod and my computer ",positive
" whether it is listening to classical rock or hip hop these headphones deliver the clarity you do not experience unless to buy a $4000~$8000 set of speakers. at $100 you get the same level of quality. but a word of warning; these will change the way you listen to music as they will make your ears more discerning to the clarity of music. i absolutely love them. ",positive
" after hearing all the great reviews about this product i was very dissappointed when i first plugged in these phones. the bass was very flat and the phones were not very clear. the other reviewers mentioned a break in period so i decided to leave the phones running on my cd jutebox for about 30 hours. wow! what a difference in sound. it was like night and day with the sound quality. the sound is truely amazing. the bass was very good and the phones were very clear. grado needs to state this breakin period on the box or manual because some people may decide to return the phones not realizing there is a breakin period ",positive
" this was a great sounding pair of headphones however after a couple of uses the right side headphone just stop receiving any sound. not sure of problem but as i stated the unit sounded great. that's why the 4 stars. refund received without any problem. not happy i had to pay for the shipping which was why i did not ask for replacement ",positive
" i have a huge head but these headphones are not a problem. the metal band easily deforms to accomodate a dome such as mine. the sound quality is ridiculously good. they are very easily powered as well. they sound loud and clear through my toshiba gigabeat which doesnt get quite as loud as an ipod (because of their efficiency they are actually louder than the 8 ohm impedence earbuds that came with the gigabeat). my head is a little sensitive so i am looking into some replacement ear cushions or some way to mod the ones i have. these phones do leak a lot of sound though. i wouldnt feel right using them on a plane or in a library or anything because they are very open. you might want something semi-open or closed if youre doing travelling since they let in plenty of sound as well. overall fantastic headphones worth every dollar ",positive
" the sr80 is the best headphone i've ever owned. twenty-some years ago i bought a set of koss headphones that cost me about half a month's salary (about 220 dollars) and these grados make those sound like a set of free earplugs in a monaural transistor radio of the 1960's. very smooth response these cans are better than any of the source components i own. they are almost perfect for travel though i'll probably end up purchasing a set of their cans for the ipod--the drivers are the same as the ones in this model or so i've been told. these pull instruments out of a recording and their ability to image instruments spatially is only matched by the clarity that they bring to vocals by azam ali of niyaz or early recordings by joan baez. about the only improvement grado could make would be improving the headband to can connection--it is held in place by a straight piece of wire and the left can has come undone from the headband. more comfortable foam would be nice too as long as it didn't compromise the sound quality. ",positive
" these headphones are comfortable simple durable and give some the the best playback i've heard. i have done a fair amount of studio work and although you can get better headphones they'll cost four or five times as much ",positive
" i purchased these about 1 month ago and used the burn in method of leaving my grado running music for 6 days straight to open up the components in the headphones for good sound and was very impressed. i do have to say that they are a bit uncomfortable at first but its worth it for the good sound and the fact that the pads adjust and soften up after a while. it's also no where near as painful as my ordeal with my first pair of canalphones which were the e2c's(see my other reviews). anyways...on the subject of sound i have to say that its an all around winner with its smooth but punchy bass and its open soundstage which i guess results from the open ear design they have and although some don't like the retro look of these phones i've really been gettin into them as of late another big plus are the rotating cups and the thick cable which guarantee's a long life for these cans. i also gotta give grado credit on it's expandability with amps and different cups which will leave me hunting for new components seeing as i'm merely just a budding audiophile with a long way to go and a limited budget that wont let me upgrade my setup whenever i want(cries)... p.s. if you use these with your computer and there are pops and hisses its because the grado are too good for the card which resulted in me buying a new 24bit external sound card from creative that gave me a real boost in sound quality. so overall these are a good pair of cans for someone who loves their music but just can't afford to buy the latest and greatest in the world of sound ",positive
" this is a real guitar. it will take a while to get it tuned properly due to new strings so be patient. if you child has a guitar fixation then this is just the fix. it will be too small for 6 year olds so be sure to get a 3/4 size for them. but this guitar is real and nicely made for such a low price. ",positive
" many thanks to the earlier reviewers who recommended the amigo. we bought both the guitar and case for our 5-year-old daughter to take to weekly lessons and we couldn't be happier. the materials workmanship and finish are remarkable for the price. and more importantly it plays like a real guitar. the sound is sweet and round enough that i genuinely enjoy the sound of 5-year-old practicing (!) and after an initial breaking-in period it holds tuning well ",positive
" if you want an inexpensive 1/2 size guitar for your child this is the one to get. the price is great and it has a sold soundboard which is unheard of at this price. the tuners work very well the neck and action are very good and it sounds good. i highly recommend this ",positive
" for the price i expected a toy. i was surprised to open the box and find an honest to goodness classical guitar. the construction fit and finish are impeccable. the sound is certainly not concert quality but that is to be expected on a $50 dollar instrument. the tuning is reasonably accurate and it is a pleasure to play. i have told me son about it and he is going to buy one for his son. ",positive
" i've been playing guitar for about 10 years and recently wanted to get my son a guitar for his birthday. the look of the guitar is nice and the sound is decent. for 50.00 the guitar is a solid value. the overall sound of the guitar is some where between ukulele and a full size guitar ",positive
" we bought this guitar for our smaller seven year old son. it was hard to choose a guitar because there are so many out there...toy version and real...but which to choose? this one is worth the pos. feedback i am giving it. it seemed so small and cute when i opened it but it is perfect for little hands and bodies! i found the price very reasonable since we aren't sure if he will keep the interest(some toy ones cost close to this) but yet i wanted him to feel like he was getting a real guitar in hopes that he will keep learning. i found that the guitar is very nice not a toy at all tunes well looks very attractive and sounds nice too. i was impressed that it came with a warranty. i am happy that i didn't spend close to this for the toy versions...and i got the real deal instead. shipping was incredibly fast from this company ",positive
" i have an almansa 435 seniorita which is a very lovely little classical guitar so i have some idea what a decent classical guitar should sound like. i got this little one for my son who is 5 and didnt want to spend much because you know how children can be when it comes to lessons and instruments. i was very surprised at the quality of the sound. it is still in it's breaking in period so the strings are still stretching but it sounds really really nice. i even played on it myself (you know just to get it warmed up for my son!) and it truly is not bad. doesnt sound tinny or toyish. sounds like a classical guitar. now i bought a much more expensive one a few years ago for my daughter who has since given up the guitar and that was handmade in mexico solid wood 3/4 size and didn't sound nearly as good as this little thing. for this price you get a solid spruce top the finish is nice kind of matted the tuners are pretty good and so far the strings aren't too bad. the base strings look like they could be silver-plated. unfortunately you dont get any product information in the box so who knows where the strings came from and what kind they are (the guitar is romanian) but the main thing is that the guitar sounds so nice that a child will be encouraged to continue the teacher will be pleased and the parents will not have to suffer from more than the usual beginning-any-instrument noises and perhaps a lot less because it has such a pleasant sound. now of course it isnt comparable to the almansa or to finer guitars but for a young child who is serious about wanting to study classical guitar this is a very fine instrument at an excellent price. this model is sold on other sites for about 20 dollars more but why pay that?! if you are looking for a small guitar for your young child this one is a very good bet. a real very decent sounding classical guitar for the price of a toy one ",positive
" while it is obvious that the life expectancy for this item in the hands of a toddler may be short it is none-the-less an actual miniature real guitar that can be tuned and played. if this item were made in america it's cost would be prohibitive and it's quality would probably be in question as well. this being no reflection on the american worker but rather the american corporate machine which is only concerned with profit. ",positive
" we got this for our 21-month-old boy who loves music and was always trying to play his dad's guitars. it is the perfect size and looks just like his daddy's black accoustic. he absolutely loves it. the manufacturers were smart and put the tuning keys on the bottom of the neck as not to draw too much attention (which helps maintain the life of the strings). my only complaint is that the bridge is not secured so it is always coming lose and falling into the body of the guitar. i keep intedning to superglue it on...otherwise i think this is a great toy for toddlers who are into music.

" this cable works fine. no degredation of sound. this is an expensive cable but the quality is good and matches the grado ear phone ",positive
" i use one of these cables to listen to the tv when the family has gone to bed (a low fi application for my sr325's i know). the cable really is very transparent sonically (i've tested it with higher quality sources too!) recommended. the headphones are great too ",positive
" since i bought the grado signature hp-2 headphone in 1992 the only complaint i had was that the cord was not long enough. the same is true with today's grado lineup and most competitors. i could not find a quality extension cable for under $100 and even then it degraded the sound. but this $39 15 foot exention cord from grado really does the job big time. i now also own a new pair of sr-60's and both headphones sound great. i can sit anywhere in my living room and enjoy the sound. grado made a great product at an affordable and reasonable price.......but this describes all of grado's products...doesn't i ",positive
" i had to do a bit of research to figure out which would be best (not having much experience in this area) and was very happy i did! this mic comes pretty highly rated on all pod casting sites for the price and (after using it with dragon naturally speaking 9) i can see why. i use it to do term papers and it is great! it is an excellent mic with very solid construction. only negative thing (although very minor) i wish i had know that i could have gotten a standard mic stand for it instead of the fancy spider or cage design advertised with it (you really don't need that). lastly no worries with the usb/windows set up. literally took it out of the package plug in and go! again a great item ",positive

" grado has a world wide reputation for the best sound reproduction in their cans (audiophile speak for headphones) and they have the awards to back them up! too often though i've read reviews where comfort is criticized and that these ear cushions are allegedly to blame. nonsense! it is true that grado cans are supraural (on the ear) as opposed to circumaural (around the ear) so you will feel the unit against your ears. these cushions were redesigned back in 1998 offering greater thickness and distance from the transducer so that you feel more comfortable while listening through your cans and the design allows for a greater soundstage for the magnificent grado cans to impress you with. these cushions called l-cush here can be used on every single pair of current grado cans except perhaps the $1000 set. i use them on my sr60's which come with a standard foam cushion that covers the whole transducer and it made them sound quite nearly as good as the sr80's! i recommend them to you wholeheartedly! if you google the listening station that is the place to purchase any grado product from ",positive
" these are easy to use and fit very well when placed. i do wish it was easier to find a replacement for the pads of my old grado hp-2's but these work great for the sr-80. i bought them just to use when the ones that came with them wore out. i put them on to see how easy it was to replace them and i had no problems ",positive
" i'm dealing with getting old but i was surprised to find that i could no longer tune my guitar by ear. in fact i was thinking the problem was with my old guitars. i decided to get a tuner. i did some research here on amazon and decided on this one. reasonable price and the instrument store shipped in good time. the first time i used it i wished i had bought it sooner. easy to use with either the lights or the needle. the guitars sounded great. as others have said: it's a little difficult to use the needle in a dark setting but the red/green lights are accurate. a simple flip out stand would be a big help. plugging in a cord jack makes it very awkward to position. that being said the idea of putting a groove on the back of the thing so you can insert a credit business or playing card to lean it against is both odd and better than nothing. will have to see how long it holds up but i am very happy with it and i will use the instrument store again.

" i'm not an experienced musician so as i once again attempted to learn guitar i once again became frustated with trying to tune it. i finally found this chromatic tuner on amazon and with such a low price decided to purchase it. i'm real glad i did because it took no time to understand how to use it and no time to get my guitar in tune. i'm very satisfied with the tool and would recommend it to any other novice guitarist like myself.

" i tried to tune my daughter's violin for about an hour without luck. the manual is not clear i should say not enough instruction for first user like me. finally on the next day after asking a friend who already used the tool (but different brand) i could get it done. since the unit is good quality very sensitive to catch the sound i rate it 4 stars ",positive
" less expensive than the stores. dont learn to play an instument without it. it really helped me learn how to tune my violi ",positive
" i bought this tuner to use with my daughter's new violin. it is doing a good job. sometimes it gives a strange note reading but trying the same string again usually gives an accurate reading. it is an inexpensive model for people like me who don't have a good ear for a pitch pipe and don't want to spend a lot of money on a tuner. i can't compare it to other tuners because it is the only one i have tried. my daughter's teacher tried it and he said it was fine. i would recommend it for someone needing a functional inexpensive tuner ",positive

" i just purchased the plusdeck2c pc cassette desk to convert my old cassettes to mp3 files for further transfer to cd's. the unit works great abit trying to see the exact position of the tapes while in a fast forward or reverse mode leaves a lot to be desired. it looses it's place and you have to do some guess work to find out where the tape is actualy at but that is only a minor problem otherwise it works great. ",positive
" when i ordered the plusdeck2 i wasn't sure how well it was going to work. well i must say that it works great and was easier to install then i had expected. i think that the hardest part of the installation was finding a desktop pc with a free 5 1/2 inch open bay. i like most people now only use a laptop but i did have an old hp desktop running windows 98. the plusdeck2 was easy to install and i had no problems with it running under windows 98. i have had no problems with the conversion to mp3 and it even has a special feature for audio books. this is a good product and works as advertised. ",positive
" the overall package is well built and well documented. the installation was straightforward and only took about 30 minutes to get up and running. it does work but if you are like me most of your tapes are getting pretty old and are not in the greatest of shape sound-wise. because the software lacks any capabilities to perform sound leveling and noise reduction your resulting .mp3s that are all over the place sound-wise. as a cheap work-around get the windowsxp plus! digital media edition. the analog recorder works well enough and is simple to use. plus it is only $15 to download. you can use it with the plusdeck to play your tapes and provide input and then use the analog recorder to actually record the files and convert to .mp3. if you get a tape player with a line out you can connect your tape player right to the back of your computer and accomplish the same without the plusdeck2c ",positive
" i used this product to copy some talking cd's it worked great. each side went on 1 cd did just what it said it would no static of any kin ",positive
" this product did everything that it claimed and installed with ease! it is wonderful to be able to archive old cassettes to digital format without all the hassle of running cords from external players etc ",positive
" this product is great but i had to get a computer person and even he had a little trouble with the installation. you can't have dial up interent with it as it uses the port. make sure that you have all the cables. the seller was very supportive and available to answer questions ",positive
" i have a pusdeck 2c for a few months now and am loving it. pro's: great for converting cassettes to mp3 format. automatically detects gaps between tracks. autoreverse. user-friendly software. con's: plusdeck's user-manual is quite unclear and has many mistakes. installation of hardware can be a little tricky for pc amatuers. they could have made the unit look a little more sleek. soundcard provided with the unit can cause minor problems with pc's onboard soundcard.

" this may not be the best tuner on the market- my boss tu-12h is more sensitive and accurate- and it's not as rugged and convenient as my boss stage tuner. but it may well be the best value of any tuner on the market. it's cheap enough to put one in the case of every instrument you own and accurate enough to do a better job that you can with your ears alone. at that price there's just no excuse for not being in tune ",positive
" this seems to work well but sometimes it doesn't seem to read right. i am a beginner - so take this with a grain of salt ",positive
" korg makes good stuff all the way around and this tuner is no exception. it's affordable and easy to use. i second those who suggest checking the batteries regularly; the tuner does become iffy if they wear down. however this is not uncommon with battery-operated tuning devices. all in all this is a great deal and it'll help you keep your instrument in ready-to-play condition ",positive

" i'm a beginner at the guitar so i don't have enough experience to rate this higher than 4... i imagine that there might be other units that are better quality. in any case i found the unit to be very easy to use and tuning my acoustic is so easy now. just a few seconds and i'm all set and ready to go. nice to finally hear what i'm supposed to hear! nothing like trying to learn guitar and being frustrated because it just doesn't sound right... now that i know i'm in tune it has made the learning more enjoyable. i would recommend this unit for anyone who is learning to play ",positive
" i've been playing the guitar about 45 years acoustic electric and nylon string. i like korg tuners and find them the best particularly for the money not only for my guitars but also for my fiddle and my banjos. they are small sturdy and no frills. they are accurate and inexpensive. they work easily. this is the only real guitar tuner that i like. i have other guitar tuners that are pretty good that are not really guitar tuners but chromatic tuners with guitar settings. this is small accurate and sturdy and fits easily inside your shirt pocket or inside the small compartments in a guitar case. it does have features for other settings which are great for alternate tunings. don't be fooled by the intellitouch and other strap ons. you can't figure out all their arrows as well as the dial on korgs and others. they are too much trouble to use especially is you are doing precision work like setting up an adjustable bridge. the only thing is that they can be a bit unreliable if the a battery gets worn down. i usually check in new batteries every time i am going out to play some place serious. with the discount prices you can find in shops and around the web the only way to beat the price on these tuners is to steal one!

" a great guitar for the price.great sound great quality and a very low price.it easily looks and sounds equal or better than a 300+ dlls guitar.the only thing that looks a little bit cheap(but hey is cheap!!!) is the rosewood fretboard but again looks like a 300+ dlls guitar and this one is only 50 dlls ",positive
" i saw this guitar on sale and ordered it on a whim thinking that if it were no good i could use it for a canoe paddle or give to the kits to play with. i have played bass recreationally for about 17 years and occasionally strummed a guitar here and there. i currently own a classical guitar i've had for 10 years and sold my steel-string guitars several years ago. i wanted this to replace the steel stringed ones and to take camping when i didn't want to take the fairly nice classical guitar and risk its damage. when i opened the box i was astounded to find a guitar with a very fine black finish action almost perfect and actually nearly in tune. it looks great and sounds very good. the sealed tuners are very smooth and have kept the guitar in tune thusfar. the only flaws i could see were a small bit of glue where the fretboard met the top just at the soundhole and a very slight overlap of some of the binding glue onto the body maybe 0.2mm x 1mm only noticable when looking for it. soundwise it sounds very good especially considering the cost. it sounds especially good with a pick. the treble side of the guitar is bright and clear. the bass side of it is a little thin and the low 'e' is fairly dull when fingerpicking. i am hoping that changing the stock strings might help it a little. it's passable just not great. the frets are very good and smooth. the ends are nicely rounded. i had expected to need to polish the frets but at this point will leave them as-is. to sum it up i think this guitar is a complete steal for the price if you are a beginner looking to start or if you want a spare guitar to keep at the lakehouse or to take camping. it plays very good and looks even better. like i said i had intended to take this one camping but it's almost too nice for that ",positive
" just to clarify this headphone amplifier does not have a speaker. you must attach headphones (supplied) or your own amp/speakers. also it comes in either brown green or yellow at random and is meant to clip on your belt/pants. it's not built like a brick so don't step on it. also in the negative column i found the distortion sound unpleasant when i cranked it to 11. however setting the level to halfway or 2/3 of the way up produced an acceptable distorted sound. (i don't have a lot of experience with other cheap amps though so the danelectro might not be the worst thing out there.) in the positive column the clean sound was good there was no hum only a small amount of hiss and the reverb was mild but pleasant. (there's no control over reverb level or speed only an on/off button.) there's plenty of power to drive the supplied headphones at loud enough to hurt your ears.) grand total: 3 buttons (power distortion on/off reverb on/off); 2 dials (volume control distortion level); 3 jacks (guitar in headphone out line out); one led. bottom line: if you don't have a headphone practice amp already getting one at the current low price is a no-brainer ",positive
" this is a wonderful little headphone amp! finally i can practice/play any time i choose and i don't have to worry about bothering anyone else. the unit has a distortion effect and an echo effect. i love the quality of the echo effect so much that i have actually used it on stage a few times in place of my (much more expensive) rocktron short timer digital delay. as others have mentioned i replaced the headset with a quality (but not expensive) sony set. but at this price it's hard to believe they include a headphone set of any kind! don't listen to those who criticize its potential for live or one-stage use. it's not meant for that! if you use this to practice or to entertain yourself without interfering with other people in the room you are going to be thrilled. i also lay down chord tracks on an inexpensive cassette recorder and practice playing lead. if anything happens to this little amp i will quickly replace it. i have encouraged all of my electric guitar students to purchase one and i'll be giving them as gifts to friends who play. at less than $20.00 the danelectro e-studio 15 is a tremendous bargain. the features flexibility functional design and quality of the product are just outstanding. you just can't go wrong ",positive
" surprisingly decent sound for something in this price range! and loud enough to fill an ordinary room with sound; hard to believe it runs off of a 9-volt battery. you can also plug in a walkman headset. in contrast the pocket rock-it costs more and is headset-only; no loudspeaker. the three knobs on top are volume tone and distortion. it comes with a fresh battery and it has a belt clip so you can wear it. it's a good value and takes up very little space. i kinda like the nostalgic pastel colors like a blast from the past ",positive
" first let me just say i'm a big fan of danelectro. i own six of their effects pedals in addition to this amp. they make excellent products for what they charge and i've been impressed with almost everything i've bought from them. on to the headphone amp - first off you might as well throw out the headphones it comes with they're crap. but that's to be expected i guess. that aside everything else performs very well. it's definitely loud enough the distortion is good however it is pretty fuzzy and gets noisy at higher volumes. the echo on this thing (which is the main reason i decided to get this instead of a rockman) is awesome. it sounds exactly like my classic slap echo pedal. it's very clear and stays consistent with the distortion on or off and at higher volumes. i like the line out option but i haven't tried it yet. it's a cool idea though. it is smaller than i thought it was going to be which was a pleasant surprise. it's about the size of a pack of cigarettes maybe a little bigger. definately small enough to keep in your pocket. it's also very lightweight. my only real complaint is the retarded sea foam green color and cheesy fake chrome but who cares no one ever sees it anyway. overall i'd definately reccomend this amp to anyone looking for a mini headphone amp (...). the dean headphone amp looks like it could be decent but it doesnt come with echo and it's hard to find. ",positive
" okay it's funky in looks - but the closest i came to an equivalent was 2.5x times the price with a lot less features. its hammy distortion and echo are actually fun and replace a couple of external pedals and the unit connects easily with simple instrument cables to your guitar or bass guitar or keyboards or whatever. you practice in peace and quiet. but wait! it comes with a mini-jack and a set of headphones. i've got an ipod and loads of headphones - these are actually a good set of (stereo) headphones well worth the price of the unit itself. it comes with its own battery - no disappoint-ment for a giftee! but the other cool trick is that you can hook it and its effects back through to an instrument amp with an extra cable - how fun is that? - very ",positive

" first of all this is a good game. i have only played with two teams and i am going to have to say that the estimated time of game play for teams is off. whenever i played it took at least three hours to finish and less if we decided not to finish. the hardest part is getting the industry awards. the game always ended with both teams going for their last award so that kept it close . . . which is cool but it is the main reason the game takes so long. also the board design seemed to make it so that we would land on on the map and music mix more than any other space. most of the questions are pretty hard especially 50's. it was one of the funniest moments during the game when my opposing team was relieved to know they were to get a britney spears question. the relief turned into frustration when the question asked for one of the producers of her album and it was not the one that they knew. it was awesome. overall it's a good game. it just takes a while to finish (especially with the difficulty of the industry awards) i hate landing on the 50's square and it seems to get like some bands more than others (like the band). buy it if you really know your music. casual listeners don't really help their teams that much ",positive
" this game is so much fun. we've played it many times without repeating the questions. building your own band is really cool. the game covers many different artists groups fads events and musical genres. i love the rock and roll relations and women rocker categories. it's a blast to play with friends! this game also makes a great gift ",positive

" i have used d'addario strings exclusively for the last 20 years. i can tell you from comparison that they are much louder and fuller than ghs boomers in the same guage and more reliable than whatever might come stock on a new guitar. there may be other brands out there that might give you more of a lifespan but at the comprimise of tone. they do tend to get grungy after a weekend's gig but if you change strings regularly i have yet to find a string that doesn't dissapoint compared to d'addario...plus you can save the empty packs and send them in for cool stuff ",positive
" i like the sound i get from the mic and it is very good valuue for the money for prosumer cam owners but consumer-level camera owners should beware. i bought this mic and found that it was way too sensitive/hot for consumer cameras like a panasonic gs200 which has no audio input level control. it picks up too much background noise and overwhelms the camera's automatic gain controller when things get loud. i'm not sure if the gs200 had a mic attenuation setting or if turning it on would have been a sufficient answer. i put a cheap radio shack in-line volume controller in between the mic and the camera (which can introduce crackle if you adjust it while recording). on prosumer cams with input level control like the canon gl2 it works fine even without turning on mic attenuation. if you have a camcorder with input level controls i might get this. another important caveat: you cannot run this mic through a the 1/8 connection of a beachtek mixer box. you'll hear nothing on the beachtek's output because of an impedance mismatch. i don't know if putting an xlr adapter on the mic cable would work ",positive
" i'm pretty content with the sound with my fx1. i wish the 'mic/line' cable could be a bit longer. other than that it's great ",positive
" i bought this mic online for $150 new. i researched for a while and decided this was the best option. i use a canon gl2 and this is a nice addition to my rig. at first i didnt think the audio was all that great however when i turned on the microphone attenuate feature of my camera and switched to the manual audio controls i found that this mic has a lot of potential. with the attenuate on you can really get clear audio without outside noise messing up your tracks. i pointed the mic at an actor on screen then pointed the mic away from the actor and you could definetly here a difference in audio detail. note: the mic has two different posistions to mount the hot shoe mount a standard tripod mount and an addition threaded hole which rode claimes to be a microphone stand mount. my mic stand doesnt thread into this hole and i consider my mic stand to be pretty standard. however their may be some adapters at my local music store. not a big issue to consider as there are plenty of mounting options available ",positive
" i purchased this for use with my home camcorder and have not been disappointed. very simple to use delivering nice clean sound ",positive
" the introduction in the owner's manual states it perfectly. rode said that when looking for a good camcorder microphone they were either horrible pieces of junk or super expensive professional models and so they decided to design a mic for this purpose. this model strikes a perfect balance. the quality of this mic is excellent. it is very sensitive and has good directional properties so it rejects noise to the side quite well. although not meant for picking up sound from long distances it can do quite well from 20 feet away and maybe more. the mount is attached to the mic so this is the only way you can use it and it is made to mount to the standard shoe that is on nearly all camcorders. it is a mono microphone but it has a stereo miniphone jack that plugs in the camcorder mic jack and feeds the audio into both channels. after trying several inferior microphones i was delighted to stumble upon this mic. it is a good value and an excellent microphone for camcorders ",positive

" i know a lot of guitarists aren't near as picky about picks as i am. so why should you be? after all there is no pick that will make you play better and they are all generally the same. wrong. i thought that too at first. i figured it's just a piece of plastic how hard can it be to pick one? i started out with fender pick because they looked pretty conventional and they were moderately priced. i blindly went through about ten of these due to them all breaking. if you knew me well you'd know that i thrash my guitar...a lot... even the thickest picks would wear down on me within a week and most of them were too slick to stay in my sweaty hand during these crash and burn guitar playing moments. i came to realize that i needed a heavy duty pick with a good grip that would retain it's shape for at least a couple of weeks. at first i thought metal was the answer. i mean it's hard as rock and most of them come with a good grip on them. but after playing with them i discovered the sound was not to my liking. it sounded too buzzy with metal. that's about the time i discovered tortex picks. i was amazed. they had the best grip i have ever felt and kept their shape for weeks! i instantly bought every size i could get all the way from the thinnest read to the bulky blue one. months later i'm keeping a stock of these picks in my house. for solos i prefer the green one because it's got just the right resistance for that fast picking but not too much so that it slows you down. for strumming i use the orange. it's just perfect... i cannot express to you how much you need to try this pick. your wasting your money on anything other than dunlop. get the tortex and see what i mean ",positive
" musician's friend is a great outfit anyway they've never steered me wrong. this product came fast as lightning and as i read in the other review the sticks were inconsistant but i can't complain. we received a pack of 16 sticks more than advertised. they are obviously not professional quality but great for practice. my son goes through drumsticks like mad and these are lasting just as long as much more expensive sticks bought at our local music store.

" i really enjoy playing with this harp whenever i get a chance to because it produces a very good sound without having to blow or suck a lot of air in. i found it very easy to bend notes in fact this is the first harp in which i was able to bend notes on. the roundedout edges are also very nice on the hands and it makes it easier to hold. it is made of plastic and not wood but that hasn't caused a problem so far. so i would reccomend a hohner golden melody in any key to anyone. although i would choose the one in the key of c if you're a begginer because it would be easier to learn on i think ",positive
" back when i was learning to play harmonica i tried many different styles and brands before discovering these golden melody harps. i really like the sound they produce and the ease of bending notes even for beginners. i also really like the fact that all of the edges are rounded making it much more comfortable on both your mouth and your hands. i know many of the greats swear by the marine band harmonica and to tell the truth i wish the golden melody had wood instead of plastic edges but i choose this one as my favorire based on the results i get with it. now as for the key of c... i get a lot more use out of the keys of a and e but thats another story..

" well for me it's a curious thing. the jellifish changes a lot the texture of the pluck when you strum or do arpeggios but it's a little fragile. i like it so that i play with it a lot of time since i bought it but i have a strong strumming stile so the tires the largest ones are breaking from the root. this is not a flaw of the jellifish they are very clear about that to produce the sounds they say it's better to do it by light strum and picking. it's just that i get emotional when i play jajaja. i also founded a way to use it as a physical cello bow. note this pick is for textures cause it not produces an effect like a pedal. it's a smart product that could bring some new life in your playing but only if you're open minded and don't expect a pick and neither a pedal effect kind of sound. i only want i always have a new one available they have a 6 month lifetime i read somewhere in the jellifish page.

" hello! i just got this new device for christmas. i had never seen one before but i guess they've been around for a while. well let me just say that this is the best gift i got this year even though it only came in my stocking. i have had more fun with the jellifish than with anything else i got this year -- i'm just fascinated that this little guy can change your tone so big! anywho i would say that it's definitely not for beginners. you need to be a real player to understand how to use it. why didn't somebody come out with something like this a long time ago is what i'm wondering! is there a user group for sharing tips and licks ",positive
" the jellifish is the first radically new thing i've seen for guitar since the ebow. i love innovative musical tools and the jellifish delivers. i am a guitar instructor and teach over 50 students a week from beginner to very advanced. i have had all of my students purchase the jellifish because in order to get the chorus! pluck! and bow! sounds you must master 3 picking styles that every guitarist should know how to use regardless. specifically a fluid sweep picking technique will produce a lush chorusing effect that is a cross somewhere between a 12-string and a chorus pedal. alternate picking when done properly from the wrist will produce the pluck! effect which somewhat sounds like a hammered dulcimer. and circular picking -- done from the thumb and forefinger -- will obtain a bowed effect that is very nice on slower scalar patterns but can also be used on arpeggios. 100 years from now the jellifish won't be novel because every guitarist will use this the same as they do capos and slides. minimal proficiency with this device is de rigueur for any serious student of the instrument ",positive

" i have found the many of the same things to be true as the previous reviewer. if you want a brighter elixir they also make nanoweb versions with a lighter coating. they do wear out quicker though. before i started using elixirs my favorite strings were d' addario 80/20 phosphor bronze. i could get 3 sets for the price of 1 set of elixirs. i really found the elixir's price to be a bit of a shock but used them for a few months. on a whim i went back to the other strings. i never noticed how quickly they oxidized and went dead before! i've gone back and stayed with elixir. i've also tried the d' addario exp and dean markley alchemy coated strings. they were okay but i found the elixirs looked and sounded better longer. downsides? the uncoated strings show wear spots and oxidize long before the coated ones. also as the coating wears off i've found the strings get fuzzy. overall i still end up changing stings a lot less than i used to. one star deducted for the high price. ",positive
" there's no such thing as a best string. from experimenting over the years i've found that while i have old standbys that will be the first thing i try often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar. coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years. they're expensive but they last a lot longer especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly. also they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings. elixir polywebs were the first coated string. the coating is much heavier than that of other strings. this produces a much less bright more muted sound. i have an old koa guitar that is so bright i can't stand it with standard strings. the elixir polywebs tone it down to the point where it's perfect. if you're looking for a darker sound then elixir polywebs are definitely worth a shot. if you want a coated string but prefer the brighter sound of uncoated strings then you definitely don't want polywebs. the 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound. if you don't want this sound you could end up awarding them 1 star ",positive

" i got this for my 9 year old pounding the desk daughter. she really likes it and i like it too. sounds are adequate and it offers some pre-recorded beats (hundreds) that are fun to plug in and play along with my guitar. i'm not sure she could become a great drummer with this alone but it comes with a dvd and gives you a nice adequate beat pad for playing along with the radio or tv and for the price..was a great choice. where's the electrical chord guys?????? seems to be the one negative but batteries aa will suffice for now. ",positive
" my five year old wanted drums for christmas so my dad got her this. she loves it and so do we. it has volume control and you can use head phones with it. it has good sound and so far isnt driving me nuts. she hasn't had any of the problems other people described with thiers ",positive
" i recieved this as a christmas gift from my wife. i am very pleased with the overall performance . i am a muscian who plays a variety of instruments including drums and have been for30 years. i write and record original music and find this to be an excellent aid to keep me in time while recording stringed instrument tracks.the effects and rythymn tracks included are also a plus. this is a good beginner item for that young drummer to learn the basics on without having to shell out mega bucks for a big set of drums that the child may loose interest in. they are also all but silent when used with headphones so everyone in the house will not have to hear them. one cautionary note-mine did not include the ac adapter as advertised; amazon.com is attempting to remedy this. you can pick up a 12 volt ada- pter at any radio shack for about twelve bucks ",positive
" in the description that toysrus has on the amazon page it states that the ac adapter is included in the box. there is no adapter and i don't look forward to using aa batteries. we selected this item because it said that it would have batteries. ",positive
" purchased this for my son a high school student. he loves the trumpet and thinks he gets better sounds with it ",positive
" was delivered in a timely manner. the product came in perfect condition with no scratches or mark. the case had everything you can possible need for maintaining your trumpet in good condition ",positive
" this product surpases its price. good quality item sent on time and very professionally presented with its own case. a good buy overall ",positive
" this item was pretty much what i expected for the price. trumpet is great for middle school age and younger beginners. came with everything needed to get started. not a bad deal for the price. nice case and trumpet has a nice appearance. good sound. ",positive
" this was a gift for my son who is learning trumpet in his middle school band. purchasing it was cheaper than renting one for the year. we are by no means musical experts but he can play it as well as the expensive instrument we were renting (valued at $900) and it sounds the same to me. the mouthpiece is a bit smaller than his former trumpet and that took a bit of adjustment but now he has no problem with it. the case isn't real high quality but with proper care should be fine in the long run ",positive
" siempre compro ernie ball porque son las mas duraderas y las de mayor calidad que he usado. he probado otro par de marcas pero nada en comparacion con ernie ball!!! el desgaste de las cuerdas es practicamente nulo; yo practico 15 horas como minimo a la semana tengo una jackson k3pro (floy r.) y aguantan bastantes libras. puedes prolongar el uso de las mismas si empleas mantenimiento con limpiadores de cuerdas ya que lo unico que he visto que con el tiempo (mas de 6 meses)se oxidan un poco ",positive
" i put these little sweet hearts on my ibanez and somtimes i swear they make the guitar what it is!the pink packaging and list of ernie ball using musicians on the back are always a plus too lmfao ",positive
" your brand of guitar strings doesn't really matter as they are only a few locations which manufacture all of the brands. but the price of the strings on amazon beats any music store ",positive
" take this to heart. i have been playing for 16 years this christmas. for the first seven years i experimented with different brands and gauges. these were the strings i settled on after all that experimentation and i have never looked back. slinky 9's are all i have bought for the past nine years. there are two types of electric guitar strings: expensive and cheap. never buy cheap strings. they sound too bright and about one out of twenty will break when you wind them up. expensive strings are a little more complicated. the durability factor is much better with expensive strings. about one out of eighty will break. the difference between the expensive brands is in the sound. some are tinny or bright. some sound like bass strings tuned way up. with that said ernie ball super slinky 9's have what i call a v voicing. it's like they have a little equalizer built in set to a good rock setting. you know boost the mids and highs and roll back the mids. these... are the only strings designed specifically for rock/metal/southern rock/progressive heavier jam bands/etc. period. man... i sound like a commercial. it's because i am passionate about these strings ",positive
" they are ok because one of them broke the first day but i think it broke because my guitar was messed up that day when i put them on but other than that they are ok ",positive
" these are the standard strings i've been using since about 2000. and after going through only 4 pairs since then i doubt i'll be changing brands. especially at this price. just look at that. in just about any store they're up to 3 times as expensive. don't let the price fool you. sure there are some strings around 20 bucks but that doesn't mean they're better. ernie ball is one of (if not the) top brands when it comes to musical instruments and accessories. the sound quality and tone with these suckers is phenominal. you can bend whammy slap and pluck these things as hard as you can and they won't break. in fact i've been on the same set of strings since about october 2003 and they're still working like the day i put them in. there isn't a whole lot to say about strings. i mean they're what you need to play the guitar and that's about it. these work well therefore they're good. nab a few extra sets of these while they're so cheap ",positive
" speedy delivery and i have had a lot of fun with the zills. i am using the in a disney sing-a-long singing the siamese cat son ",positive
" i am a middle eastern dance teacher and bought these for my beginner students in class. they are small and manageable and have a nice sound for the money...if you are looking for some inexpensive zills for beginner students and performers i recommend these. i also ordered some for another teacher and the students loved them ",positive
" i agree with the previous reviewer. i'm giving this item five stars because it is exactly what we hoped it would be: a reasonably-priced way to get students started on zills. there is no convenient local source for zills so we have to stock up and then sell to students and the price/value of these zills makes that possible. ",positive
" i bought these inexpensive zills for my students to use in class as i was running low on loaners. of course i wasn't expecting top quality instruments but they are just great for students to use in class while they're learning -- and still leave the student some motivation to buy a personal set of high-quality zills! they came in individual zip-lock bags and even included tiny safety pins. perfect for teachers buying for a whole classroom ",positive
" i have tried every type/brand of harmonica holder for the last 8 or 10 years and finally found one that works great and doesn't look like some type of orthopedic device. i will caution anyone using this harp holder to be careful when adjusting it not to bend the flat stamped spots that keep the springs in place. i managed to break one that way but was still able to finish the show in spite it being broken because it's made so well. www.dalemarsh.com ",positive
" as a guitar and harmonica player who plays out in small clubs it is very hard to find a quality harmonica holder that perfectly holds 10 hole harmonicas .when your specialty is bob dylan neal young and donavan covers you have to have a dependable holder that does not slip.this product is perfect for that type of music.i bought two so that i could have one set up in g and the other set up in d to cut down on set up time ",positive
" this is a classic boss pedal it's been around for awhile. boss is known for their great sounding effects and rugged construction of their products this one is no different. the distortion from this pedal is simple very smooth and very versatile. it's not too noisy allowing single notes played to be heard with clarity. if you'd like to hear it you can probably find some sound clips of it being used on boss's website ",positive
" i hear it sucks with synth machines but with guitars it works fairlynow mine hasnt arrived so i guess ill start by saying it looks great and since its boss you know its built like a tank.and from what i hear its reliable enough to use in minor stage shows (talent contestopen mic night etc.).its also the pedal steve vai and joe satriani use so i guess its gotta be good ",positive
" our son wanted a drum set for his 15th birthday. seeings he is totally new to this we didn't want to pay a huge sum for a set only to have him lose interest. this set is great for beginners and he's very happy with it. to people considering purchasing this please note that the cymbals are not included with this set even though they are in the picture. perhaps the company should consider posting another photos sans the cymbals ",positive
" my older son has been taking drums for several months and doing very well. for christmas we bought him an electronic drum kit and needed to get a throne also. i found this one on amazon and have been very happy with the quality and the price ",positive
" the dava technology is my favored type in all situations. the combination of a flexible center and a rigid playing surface is wonderful. in addition the pick surface is textured to enable a better grip with wet or dry fingers. dava is the only brand of picks i use and each type suits my every need. i whole heartedly recommend them to anyone. ",positive
" i love these picks because they have an easy grip providing less slippage when i'm really rocking out. i like that they are flexible and still very firm. this is the only place i can find these picks latel ",positive
" this is the best pick i've used. it gives me exactly the type of control i need at any moment. love 'em ",positive
" it seems like a gimmick but they really work. i was using the little jazz iiis but couldn't strum with them - these work as a mix of a soft strumming pick and a precise hard lead pick ",positive
